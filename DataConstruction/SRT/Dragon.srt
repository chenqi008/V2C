1
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,744
This is Berk.

2
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,290
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a
few degrees south of freezing to death.

3
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,211
It's located solidly
on the meridian of misery.

4
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,799
My village. In a word, sturdy.

5
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:54,637
It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.

6
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,850
We have fishing, hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets.

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,019
The only problems are the pests.

8
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,441
You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.

9
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,776
We have...

10
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,072
...dragons.

11
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,659
Most people would leave. Not us.

12
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,455
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.

13
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,624
My name is Hiccup.

14
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,170
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.

15
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,007
Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls.

16
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,509
Like our charming Viking demeanor
wouldn't do that.

17
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,678
Morning!

18
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,682
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,643
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!

20
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,734
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!

21
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,529
That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.

22
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:58,534
When he was a baby, he popped
a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

23
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,787
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

24
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,954
What have we got?

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,917
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.

26
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,504
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.

27
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,713
Good.

28
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,715
Hoist the torches!

29
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,557
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!

30
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,562
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

31
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,899
They wouldn't know
what to do with all this.

32
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,901
They need toothpicks, don't they?

33
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,280
The meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.

34
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:40,910
I've been his apprentice
since I was little. Well, littler.

35
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:45,081
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

36
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,374
Hurry!

37
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,753
See? Old village,
lots and lots of new houses.

38
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,255
Fire!

39
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,714
Let's go!

40
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,469
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

41
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,221
...and...

42
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,432
...Astrid.

43
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,820
Their job is so much cooler.

44
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,366
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.

45
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,452
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,454
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.

47
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,791
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.

48
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,627
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.

49
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,337
You can't even throw one of these!

50
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,676
OK, fine,
but this will throw it for me.

51
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,222
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!

52
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,433
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!

53
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,644
If you ever want to get out there
to fight dragons...

54
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,814
...you need to stop all this.

55
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,066
But you just pointed to all of me.

56
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,612
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.

57
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,780
Oh, yes.

58
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,658
You, sir,
are playing a dangerous game.

59
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,829
Keeping this much
raw Vikingness contained?

60
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,664
There will be consequences!

61
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,293
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.

62
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:18,007
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...

63
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,009
...is everything around here.

64
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,680
A Nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed.

65
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,265
Gronckles are tough.

66
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,685
Taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend.

67
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,812
A Zippleback?

68
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,775
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.

69
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,193
They found the sheep!

70
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,528
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.

71
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,364
- Hurry up!
- Fire!

72
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,700
And then there's
the Monstrous Nightmare.

73
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,745
Only the best Vikings go after those.

74
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:51,874
They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire.

75
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,212
Reload! I'll take care of this.

76
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,717
But the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one's ever seen.

77
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,886
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!

78
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,388
Get down!

79
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,892
Jump!

80
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,438
This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...

81
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,692
...never misses.

82
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:22,613
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.

83
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,908
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

84
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,287
Stay. Put. There.

85
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,457
You know what I mean.

86
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,086
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!

87
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,629
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!

88
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,761
Let's get him!

89
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,763
Mind yourselves!

90
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,932
The devils still have
some juice in them!

91
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,279
Come on. Give me something to
shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

92
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,637
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

93
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,848
Did anybody see that?

94
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,517
Except for you.

95
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,901
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!

96
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,338
You're all out.

97
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,013
Oh, and there's one more thing
you need to know.

98
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,484
Sorry, Dad.

99
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,703
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.

100
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:39,291
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!

101
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,710
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.

102
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,381
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...

103
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:46,841
Stop!

104
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,051
Just stop.

105
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,429
Every time you step outside,
disaster follows.

106
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,640
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?

107
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,394
Winter is almost here
and I have an entire village to feed!

108
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,649
Between you and me, the village
could do with a little less feeding.

109
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,734
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

110
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,071
Why can't you follow
the simplest orders?

111
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,868
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
and I have to just kill it.

112
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,036
It's who I am, Dad.

113
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:21,417
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.

114
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,377
Get back to the house.

115
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,504
Make sure he gets there.

116
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,299
I have his mess to clean up.

117
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,551
Quite the performance.

118
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,512
I've never seen anyone
mess up that badly. That helped.

119
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,307
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.

120
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,770
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.

121
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,190
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.

122
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,109
When he does,
it's with this disappointed scowl,

123
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,695
like someone skimped on meat
in his sandwich.

124
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,908
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.

125
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,829
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy
arms, extra guts and glory on the side.

126
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,749
This here, this is a talking fishbone."

127
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,959
You're thinking about this wrong.

128
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:08,589
It's not so much what you look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.

129
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,133
Thank you for summing that up.

130
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,512
Look, the point is, stop trying
so hard to be something you're not.

131
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,015
I just want to be one of you guys.

132
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,111
Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!

133
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,822
It's the only way
we'll be rid of them.

134
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,991
If we find the nest and destroy it,

135
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,328
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!

136
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,997
One more search
before the ice sets in.

137
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,166
Those ships never come back.

138
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,796
We're Vikings. It's an occupational
hazard. Now who's with me?!

139
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:49,964
Count me out.

140
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,216
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.

141
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,511
All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.

142
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,263
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!

143
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,514
That's more like it.

144
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,850
I'll pack my undies.

145
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,937
No, I need you to stay
and train some new recruits.

146
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,525
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.

147
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,861
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.

148
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,030
What could possibly go wrong?

149
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,324
What am I going
to do with him, Gobber?

150
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,826
Put him in training.

151
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,203
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

152
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,206
He'd be killed before
the first dragon is out of its cage.

153
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,958
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.

154
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,584
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.

155
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,961
No, you don't.

156
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,879
Listen, you know what he's like.

157
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:35,009
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.

158
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,680
He doesn't listen. He has
the attention span of a sparrow.

159
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,350
I take him fishing
and he goes hunting for trolls!

160
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,061
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.

161
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,231
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

162
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,649
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.

163
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,694
...my father told me to bang
my head against a rock and I did it.

164
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,655
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.

165
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,991
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.

166
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,118
That rock split in two.

167
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,371
It taught me what
a Viking could do, Gobber.

168
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:08,542
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!

169
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:13,756
Even as a boy, I knew what I was,
what I had to become.

170
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,425
Hiccup is not that boy.

171
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,886
You can't stop him, Stoick.

172
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,221
You can only prepare him.

173
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,601
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't
always be around to protect him.

174
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,855
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

175
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,292
Oh, the gods hate me.

176
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,629
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.

177
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,799
I manage to lose an entire dragon.

178
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,308
Oh, wow. I did it.

179
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,396
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!

180
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,898
I have brought down
this mighty beast!

181
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,304
I'm going to kill you, dragon.

182
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,725
Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.

183
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,187
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!

184
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,306
I did this.

185
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,631
Hiccup.

186
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,508
Dad...

187
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,177
...I have to talk to you, Dad.

188
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,513
I need to speak with you, too, son.

189
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,392
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.

190
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
- What?
- What?

191
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,438
- You go first.
- No, you go first.

192
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,689
All right.

193
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:45,193
You get your wish. Dragon training...
you start in the morning.

194
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,362
Oh, man, I should have gone first.

195
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,281
I was thinking, you know,

196
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,451
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,

197
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:57,205
but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?

198
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,373
You'll need this.

199
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,751
I don't want to fight dragons.

200
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,336
Come on. Yes, you do.

201
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,381
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

202
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,342
But you will kill dragons.

203
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,511
No, I'm really very extra-sure
that I won't.

204
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,555
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?

205
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,891
This is serious, son.

206
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,313
When you carry this axe,
you carry all of us with you.

207
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,150
Which means you walk like us,
you talk like us...

208
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,194
...you think like us.

209
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,529
No more of... this.

210
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,657
You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,118
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.

212
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,578
Deal?

213
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,581
Deal.

214
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,209
Good.

215
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,087
Train hard.

216
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,756
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,467
And I'll be here.

218
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,260
Maybe.

219
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,764
Welcome to dragon training!

220
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,350
No turning back.

221
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,619
I hope I get some serious burns.

222
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,373
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.

223
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,792
Yeah, it's only fun if you get
a scar out of it.

224
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,210
Yeah, no kidding, right?

225
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,379
Pain. Love it.

226
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,256
Oh, great. Who let him in?

227
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,134
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best

228
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,928
will win the honor
of killing his first dragon

229
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,805
in front of the entire village.

230
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:41,476
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?

231
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,146
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

232
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,316
Don't worry. You're small and weak...
that'll make you less of a target.

233
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,235
They'll see you as sick or insane

234
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,572
and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.

235
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,284
Behind these doors
are just a few of the many species

236
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,452
you will learn to fight!

237
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,121
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.

238
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,622
The Hideous Zippleback.

239
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,166
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

240
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,334
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.

241
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,503
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.

242
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,380
Can you stop that?!

243
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,425
And the Gronckle.

244
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,677
Jaw strength 8.

245
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,345
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?

246
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,015
I believe in learning on the job.

247
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,853
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...

248
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,147
...you're dead!

249
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,940
What's the first thing you'll need?

250
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,859
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?

251
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,236
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!

252
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,698
Your most important piece of equipment
is your shield!

253
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,869
If you must choose between
a sword or a shield, take the shield!

254
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,038
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!

255
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,248
Take that one. It has a flower...
girls like flowers.

256
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,584
Oops, this one has blood on it.

257
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,671
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?

258
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,507
Shields are good for another thing.

259
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,928
Noise! Make lots of it
to throw off a dragon's aim!

260
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,723
All dragons have
a limited number of shots.

261
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,100
How many does a Gronckle have?

262
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,560
- Five?
- No, six!

263
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,896
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!

264
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,398
Fishlegs, out!

265
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,609
Hiccup, get in there!

266
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,907
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.

267
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,700
You look like you work out.

268
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,744
Snotlout! You're done!

269
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,579
So it's just you and me, huh?

270
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,373
Nope, just you.

271
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,251
One shot left!

272
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,628
Hiccup!

273
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,638
And that's six.

274
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,850
Go back to bed,
you overgrown sausage!

275
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,563
You'll get another chance,
don't you worry.

276
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,732
Remember, a dragon will always,

277
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:56,444
always go for the kill.

278
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,662
So... why didn't you?

279
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,691
This was stupid.

280
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,904
Why don't you just fly away?

281
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,734
All right, where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?

282
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,654
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.

283
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,407
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.

284
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,575
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."

285
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,286
She's right. You have to be
tough on yourselves.

286
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,205
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

287
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,874
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.

288
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,751
He's never where he should be.

289
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,837
Thank you, Astrid.

290
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:23,591
You need to live and breathe
this stuff. The dragon manual.

291
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:27,971
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.

292
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,559
No attacks tonight. Study up.

293
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,352
Wait, you mean read?

294
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,770
While we're still alive?

295
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,856
Why read words
when you can just kill the stuff

296
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,691
the words tell you stuff about?

297
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,777
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon

298
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,239
that sprays boiling water at your
face. And there's this other one...

299
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,074
Yeah. That sounds great.

300
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,453
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...

301
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,204
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.

302
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,499
Another one has spines like trees.

303
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,835
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.

304
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:03,798
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...

305
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,592
...tomorrow.

306
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,562
Dragon classifications.

307
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,982
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.

308
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:26,654
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

309
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,824
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

310
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,743
that can kill a man at close range.

311
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,829
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

312
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,833
Timberjack. This gigantic creature
has razor-sharp wings

313
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,960
that can slice through full-grown trees.

314
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,130
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

315
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:49,135
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water
at its victim. Extremely dangerous.

316
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:59,229
Changewing. Even newly hatched
dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.

317
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:03,066
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.

318
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,694
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

319
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,864
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.

320
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,992
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.

321
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,995
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

322
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,874
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.

323
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,044
Night Fury.

324
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,257
Speed unknown. Size unknown.

325
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,886
The unholy offspring
of lightning and death itself.

326
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,847
Never engage this dragon.

327
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:38,184
Your only chance: Hide and pray
it does not find you.

328
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,075
I can almost smell them.

329
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,869
They're close.

330
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,329
Steady.

331
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,341
Take us in.

332
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,261
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.

333
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,263
Hard to port!

334
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,768
Steady!

335
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:37,285
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice
the book had nothing on Night Furies.

336
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:42,123
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?

337
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,502
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!

338
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,382
Today it's all about attack!

339
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,260
Nadders are quick and light
on their feet.

340
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,138
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!

341
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,143
I'm really beginning to question
your teaching methods!

342
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,771
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.

343
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,857
Find it, hide in it and strike!

344
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,777
Do you ever bathe?

345
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,529
If you don't like it, then
just get your own blind spot.

346
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,657
How about I give you one?

347
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,245
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.

348
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,123
Hey, so, how would one sneak up
on a Night Fury?

349
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,794
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Get in there!

350
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,296
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!

351
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,798
Get down.

352
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,939
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.

353
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,943
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

354
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,070
What do you want me to do,
block out the sun?

355
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,155
I could do that but I don't have time!

356
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,116
They probably...

357
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:02,078
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.

358
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,372
Has anyone ever seen one napping?

359
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,710
Hiccup!

360
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,715
Love on the battlefield.

361
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:14,924
She could do better.

362
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,718
Let me... Why don't you?

363
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,520
Well done, Astrid.

364
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,233
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

365
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,486
Our parents' war
is about to become ours.

366
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,864
Figure out which side you're on.

367
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,155
Toothless.

368
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,533
I could have sworn you had...

369
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,870
...teeth.

370
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,126
No, no, no.

371
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,504
I don't have any more!

372
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:17,286
And with one twist, he took my hand
and swallowed it whole!

373
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,581
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.

374
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,041
He must have passed the word,

375
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:25,753
because it wasn't a month before
another one of them took my leg.

376
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,590
Isn't it weird to think
your hand was inside a dragon?

377
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,967
Like if your mind was still
in control of it,

378
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,680
you could have killed the dragon
from inside by crushing his heart.

379
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40,601
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

380
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,772
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.

381
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,442
It's the wings and the tails
you really want.

382
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,070
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

383
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:54,532
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

384
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,371
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.

385
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,791
Tomorrow we get to the big boys,
slowly but surely

386
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,169
making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare.

387
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,839
But who'll win the honor of killing it?

388
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,259
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

389
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,511
Your mom let you get a tattoo?

390
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,388
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.

391
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:21,308
OK, I've been stuck with you since
birth, and that was never there before.

392
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,311
Yes, it was. You've just never
seen me from the left side.

393
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,521
Hey, Toothless.

394
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,525
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.

395
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,653
OK, that's disgusting.

396
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:18,574
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic cod...

397
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,910
...and a whole smoked eel.

398
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,251
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.

399
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,004
Yeah, I don't really like
eel much, either.

400
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,926
That's it.

401
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,804
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.

402
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,933
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here,

403
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,936
minding my own business.

404
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,699
It's OK.

405
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,044
OK.

406
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,768
That's not too bad. It works.

407
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,317
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

408
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,872
Oh, my! It's working!

409
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,963
Yes, yes! I did it!

410
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,226
Yeah!

411
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,353
Today is about teamwork.

412
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,568
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.

413
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,697
The Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky.

414
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,326
One head breathes gas,
the other head lights it.

415
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,288
Your job is to know which is which.

416
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,625
Razor-sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre-digestion.

417
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,127
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...

418
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,587
Will you please stop that?!

419
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:44,678
If that dragon shows
either of his faces, I'm gonna...

420
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,055
There!

421
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,558
Hey, it's us, idiots!

422
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,478
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.

423
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,023
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure.

424
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:00,736
Wait.

425
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,991
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

426
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,036
Chances of survival are
dwindling to single digits now.

427
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,045
Wrong head.

428
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:19,672
Fishlegs!

429
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,884
Now, Hiccup!

430
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,764
Oh, come on.

431
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,770
Hiccup!

432
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,066
Back, back, back!

433
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:43,862
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.

434
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,866
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.

435
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:02,923
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got
some things I need to...

436
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,801
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!

437
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,855
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.

438
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:04,902
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys
go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

439
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,069
Meet the Terrible Terror.

440
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,531
It's like the size of my...

441
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,075
Get it off!

442
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,578
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

443
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,667
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

444
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,921
Oh, great.

445
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,048
Hiccup.

446
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,524
Hiccup? Are you in there?

447
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,652
Astrid. Hey.

448
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,405
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.

449
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,491
I normally don't care what people do,
but you're acting weird.

450
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,369
Well, weirder.

451
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:51,735
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.

452
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:52,903
Excellent.

453
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,280
I hope you had more success than me.

454
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:59,785
Well, if by success, you mean that
your parenting troubles are over, yes.

455
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,288
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!

456
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,582
Out with the old and
in with the new, right?

457
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,127
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!

458
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:10,837
- Come over here.
- Hurry!

459
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,005
He's gone?

460
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:18,095
Most afternoons, but who can blame
him? The life of a celebrity's rough.

461
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:22,015
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

462
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,183
Hiccup?

463
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:27,479
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.

464
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:39,324
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

465
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,243
Here we go. Here we go. Position...

466
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,912
...three... no, four.

467
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,809
All right, it's go time. It's go time.

468
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,817
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!

469
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,410
Yes, it worked!

470
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,374
Sorry!

471
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,045
It was my fault.

472
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,381
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.

473
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:37,883
Three.

474
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,096
Yeah! Go, baby!

475
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:44,848
Yes!

476
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:49,186
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!

477
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,854
Stop!

478
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:54,858
No!

479
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,323
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

480
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,868
All right, OK, you've gotta
kind of angle yourself.

481
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,829
OK, no, no, no. Come back down
towards me! Come back down...

482
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,289
Yeah!

483
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,209
Come on.

484
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,178
No, thanks. I'm good.

485
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,343
Not so fireproof
on the inside, are you?

486
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,636
Here you go.

487
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:07,324
Everything we know
about you guys is wrong.

488
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,504
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...

489
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,671
I know.

490
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,093
- I came looking for you.
- You did?

491
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,762
You've been keeping secrets.

492
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,472
I have?

493
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,266
Just how long did you think
you could hide it?

494
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,102
I don't know what you're...

495
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:40,690
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

496
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,776
So...

497
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,403
...let's talk...

498
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,447
...about that dragon.

499
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:51,785
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.

500
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,371
I just didn't know how to...

501
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,294
You're not upset?

502
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,089
What?! I was hoping for this!

503
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:07,634
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!

504
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,554
Wait till you spill
a Nadder's guts the first time!

505
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,431
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!

506
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,394
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!

507
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:21,731
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.

508
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,193
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.

509
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,612
And all the while
you were holding out on me!

510
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,656
Oh, Thor Almighty!

511
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,827
With you doing so well in the ring...

512
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,831
...we finally have something
to talk about.

513
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:55,181
Here, I brought you something,

514
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,143
to keep you safe in the ring.

515
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,395
Wow. Thanks.

516
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:05,442
Your mother would have wanted you to
have it. It's half of her breastplate.

517
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:10,864
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.

518
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:16,578
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.

519
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:26,546
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.

520
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,132
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.

521
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,508
Thanks for stopping by...

522
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,720
...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.

523
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,599
Well... Yep. Good night.

524
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,575
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.

525
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:58,453
Please, by all means.

526
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,592
This time, this time for sure!

527
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,187
No! No, son of a half-troll,

528
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,357
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.

529
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,359
- So, later.
- Not so fast.

530
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,486
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!

531
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,197
Late for what, exactly?

532
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,200
Quiet down! The elder has decided.

533
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:52,882
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!

534
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,345
That's my boy!

535
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:01,224
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...

536
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,309
...leaving! We're leaving.

537
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:07,939
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me
are taking a little vacation.

538
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,649
Forever.

539
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,945
Oh, man.

540
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,992
What the?!
What are you doing here?

541
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,245
I want to know what's going on.

542
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:26,499
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.

543
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:29,502
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?

544
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,712
Training?

545
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,505
It better not involve this.

546
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:36,301
I know this looks really bad,
but you see...

547
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,680
You're right. You're right.
You're right.

548
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:45,977
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.

549
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:50,273
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.

550
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,400
Why would you do that?!

551
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:56,988
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.

552
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:58,782
Oh, man.

553
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,242
Get down!

554
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,579
Run, run!

555
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,000
It's OK! It's OK.

556
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,710
She's a friend.

557
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,214
You just scared him.

558
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,882
I scared him?!

559
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,510
Who is "him"?

560
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:23,598
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

561
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,897
We're dead.

562
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,025
Where do you think you're going?

563
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,034
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!

564
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,256
Hiccup, get me down from here!

565
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,591
You have to give me a chance to explain.

566
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,427
I am not listening
to anything you have to say!

567
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,056
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.

568
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,976
Please, Astrid.

569
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,034
Now get me down.

570
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,954
Toothless, down. Gently.

571
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,458
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

572
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,338
Toothless!

573
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,342
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!

574
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,346
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.

575
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:54,022
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!

576
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,027
And now the spinning.

577
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:03,072
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

578
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,826
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.

579
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,828
Just get me off of this thing.

580
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,230
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

581
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,108
It's amazing.

582
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,985
He's amazing.

583
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,781
So what now?

584
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,784
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.

585
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,078
You know you'll have to kill...

586
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:15,788
...kill a dragon.

587
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,665
Don't remind me.

588
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,209
Toothless, what's happening?

589
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,088
What is it?

590
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:27,967
Get down!

591
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,986
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

592
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,156
Toothless, you gotta get us
out of here, bud.

593
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:55,119
It looks like
they're hauling in their kill.

594
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,830
What does that make us?

595
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,251
What my dad wouldn't give
to find this.

596
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,646
It's satisfying to know that all of
our food has been dumped down a hole.

597
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,649
They're not eating any of it.

598
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,749
What is that?

599
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:33,885
All right, bud,
we got to get out of here... now!

600
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:47,064
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

601
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,233
They're the workers
and that's their queen.

602
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,944
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

603
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,362
No! No.

604
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:57,783
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

605
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,661
We have to think this through
carefully.

606
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:03,748
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

607
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,626
the thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here,

608
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,086
and you want to keep it a secret?

609
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,173
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?

610
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,509
Yes.

611
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,478
OK. Then what do we do?

612
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:29,398
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

613
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,317
OK.

614
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,153
That's for kidnapping me.

615
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,871
That's for everything else.

616
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,049
What are you looking at?

617
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,929
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

618
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:06,143
I can show my face in public again!

619
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,565
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks

620
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:16,320
Hiccup would go from, well,
being Hiccup

621
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:20,992
to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast

622
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,744
and shipped him off
for fear he'd gone mad!

623
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,746
And you know it!

624
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:32,712
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised

625
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,881
or more proud than I am.

626
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,802
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

627
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:43,180
Today, he becomes one of us!

628
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,061
Be careful with that dragon.

629
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,648
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?

630
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,901
Put an end to this. I have to try.

631
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,031
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

632
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,241
just make sure
they don't find Toothless.

633
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,454
I will. Just promise me
it won't go wrong.

634
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,458
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.

635
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,466
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

636
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,886
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

637
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,941
I would have gone for the hammer.

638
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:41,280
I'm ready.

639
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,932
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!

640
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,687
What is he doing?

641
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,110
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

642
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,160
I'm not one of them.

643
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:34,542
What's he thinking?

644
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:36,585
- Stop the fight.
- No!

645
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,463
I need you all to see this.

646
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,508
They're not what we think they are.

647
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,677
We don't have to kill them.

648
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,389
I said, stop the fight!

649
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,148
Out of my way!

650
01:02:57,399 --> 01:03:20,463
Hiccup!

651
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,554
This way!

652
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,159
Night Fury!

653
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,554
Toothless, go. Get out of here.

654
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:13,933
Go, go!

655
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,100
Stoick, no!

656
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,644
Dad, he won't hurt you!

657
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:20,689
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!

658
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:22,816
Toothless, stop!

659
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:26,445
No! No!

660
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,075
Get him!

661
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,664
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!

662
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,791
Please don't hurt him.

663
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:47,258
Put it with the others.

664
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,513
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.

665
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:54,515
- Dad?
- We had a deal!

666
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:58,727
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.

667
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,314
So everything in the ring,
a trick? A lie?

668
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:06,610
I screwed up. I should have
told you before now. I just...

669
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:10,322
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

670
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:13,659
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?

671
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,536
Not the people you almost killed?

672
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:18,122
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

673
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,291
They've killed hundreds of us!

674
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,167
And we've killed thousands of them!

675
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:27,590
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.

676
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:31,594
If they don't bring enough food back,
they'll be eaten themselves.

677
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:36,056
There's something else
on their island. It's a dragon like...

678
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,976
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?

679
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,936
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?

680
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,647
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.

681
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:46,525
Only a dragon can find the island.

682
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,988
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.

683
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:54,199
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

684
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:58,287
Dad, please. I promise you,
you can't win this one!

685
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,497
No, Dad. No.

686
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,626
For once in your life,
would you please just listen to me?!

687
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,175
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.

688
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,304
You're not my son.

689
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,767
Ready the ships!

690
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,988
This way.

691
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,865
Set sail!

692
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,618
We head for Helheim's Gate.

693
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,462
Lead us home, devil.

694
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,860
It's a mess.

695
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,448
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:

696
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,492
Your father, your tribe,
your best friend.

697
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,828
Thank you for summing that up.

698
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:08,167
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon
when I found him in the woods?

699
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:12,629
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.

700
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,340
So why didn't you?

701
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,804
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

702
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,682
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.

703
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,143
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

704
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:29,521
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

705
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:34,735
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

706
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,153
You said "wouldn't".

707
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,489
Whatever! I wouldn't!

708
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:42,534
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

709
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,957
First one to ride one, though.

710
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,419
So?

711
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:58,759
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.

712
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:03,430
I looked at him and I saw myself.

713
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:09,937
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?

714
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:15,901
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.

715
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,530
Then something crazy.

716
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,533
That's more like it.

717
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,253
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.

718
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,922
- Here!
- One length to your stern.

719
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:42,302
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men and, well, some of them

720
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:46,098
are wondering what it is
we're up to here. Not me, of course.

721
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,767
I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some,

722
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:52,437
not me, are wondering if there is
in fact a plan at all

723
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:56,233
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.

724
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,527
Of course. Send them running.

725
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:01,446
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.

726
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,040
Step aside.

727
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,513
Bear to port.

728
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:35,814
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

729
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:40,986
You were wise to seek help
from the world's most deadly weapon.

730
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,154
It's me.

731
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,698
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...

732
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,743
You're crazy. I like that.

733
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,579
So, what is the plan?

734
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,507
That's not really encouraging.

735
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,970
I was wondering where that went.

736
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:22,194
Stay low and ready your weapons.

737
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,169
We're here.

738
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,621
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.

739
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,999
It's OK. It's OK.

740
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:29,678
Where are you going?

741
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,472
You'll need something
to help you hold on.

742
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:45,736
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.

743
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,864
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.

744
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,284
No matter how this ends,
it ends today.

745
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,007
Is that it?

746
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,013
We've done it!

747
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:08,068
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!

748
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,874
Get clear!

749
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,928
Beard of Thor! What is that?!

750
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:41,017
Odin help us.

751
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:46,898
Catapults!

752
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,952
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!

753
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,758
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.

754
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,094
Lead the men
to the far side of the island!

755
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,429
Gobber, go with the men!

756
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:20,557
I think I'll stay, in case your
thinking of doing something crazy.

757
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,852
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing someone to hunt!

758
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,562
Then I can double that time.

759
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,610
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!

760
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:44,915
Come on! Fight me!

761
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,958
No, me!

762
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,800
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!

763
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,136
Move, Fishlegs!

764
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:02,140
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!

765
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:06,102
Up! Let's move it!

766
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:11,024
Every bit the boar-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were!

767
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,444
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.

768
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:17,405
Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!

769
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,576
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large
nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!

770
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:25,121
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot,
make noise, keep it confused!

771
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:29,000
Ruff, Tuff, find out
if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!

772
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,543
That's my specialty!

773
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:34,005
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.

774
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:37,425
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!

775
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,345
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!

776
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:50,397
- Troll!
- Butt elf!

777
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,107
Bride of Grendel!

778
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,365
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!

779
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
There!

780
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:13,795
Go help the others!

781
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,048
OK, hold on. Hold on.

782
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:23,471
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!

783
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:36,484
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!

784
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,448
I'm OK!

785
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,074
Less OK!

786
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:49,456
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?

787
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,337
Yeah! You're the Viking!

788
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:34,209
Dad?

789
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,396
You got it, bud.

790
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,358
Hiccup!

791
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:04,072
I'm sorry... for everything.

792
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,573
Yeah. Me, too.

793
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,617
You don't have to go up there.

794
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:11,663
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.

795
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,000
I'm proud to call you my son.

796
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,420
Thanks, Dad.

797
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,802
He's up!

798
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,223
Get Snotlout out of there.

799
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,641
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!

800
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,351
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.

801
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,978
No, this way.

802
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:37,355
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!

803
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:43,153
I can't believe that worked!

804
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,703
Night Fury!

805
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:53,621
Get down!

806
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,549
Did you get her?

807
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,060
Go.

808
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:20,607
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!

809
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,583
You think that did it?

810
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:45,256
Well, he can fly.

811
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,821
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.

812
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,240
Come on, bud!

813
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,956
Here it comes!

814
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:11,634
Watch out!

815
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,139
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.

816
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,935
Come on! Is that the best you can do?!

817
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:41,205
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.

818
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,503
Hold, Toothless.

819
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,422
Now!

820
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,530
No.

821
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,407
No!

822
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:36,260
Hiccup!

823
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:38,805
Son!

824
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:42,934
Hiccup.

825
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:06,374
Oh, son.

826
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,419
I did this.

827
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,493
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.

828
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,168
Hiccup!

829
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:59,969
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.

830
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:19,906
Thank you for saving my son.

831
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:23,701
Well, you know... most of him.

832
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:43,596
Hey, Toothless.

833
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,724
I'm happy to see you, too.

834
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:52,480
I'm in my house.

835
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:55,483
You're in my house.

836
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:57,401
Does my dad know you're here?

837
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,737
What? OK, OK.

838
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,323
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.

839
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,617
Toothless! Oh, come on.

840
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,867
OK. Thanks, bud.

841
01:26:56,545 --> 01:27:00,089
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!

842
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:01,507
Hold on tight! Here we go!

843
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:05,887
What?

844
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:16,355
I knew it. I'm dead.

845
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:21,485
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?

846
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,321
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!

847
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,990
It's Hiccup!

848
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:31,662
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of this.

849
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,915
You just gestured to all of me.

850
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,127
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.

851
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:41,797
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?

852
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:44,258
I might make a few tweaks.

853
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,970
That's for scaring me.

854
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:50,681
What is it always going
to be this way? 'Cause...

855
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,810
...I could get used to it.

856
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,857
Welcome home.

857
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,318
- Night Fury!
- Get down!

858
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,455
You ready?

859
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:19,085
This is Berk.

860
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:23,339
It snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three.

861
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,636
Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless.

862
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:33,307
The people that grow here
are even more so.

863
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,313
The only upsides are the pets.

864
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:45,987
While other places
have ponies or parrots...

865
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,864
...we have...

866
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,325
...dragons.

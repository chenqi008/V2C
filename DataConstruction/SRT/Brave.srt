1
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,079
Where are you? Come out!

2
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,248
Come out!

3
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,084
Come on out.

4
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,169
I'm coming to get you.

5
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,506
Where are you, you little rascal?
I'm coming to get you.

6
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,512
Hm.

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,307
Where is my little birthday girl, hm?

8
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,474
I'm going to gobble her up
when I find her.

9
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,354
Oh!

10
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,356
I'm going to eat you. I am.

11
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,979
Och, Fergus, no weapons on the table.

12
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,240
Can I shoot an arrow?
Canl? Canl? Can 1? Can I?

13
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,534
Please? Can I?

14
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,658
Not with that. Why not...

15
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,038
Use your very own?

16
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,413
Happy birthday, my wee darling!

17
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,381
Now, there's a good girl.

18
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,008
Draw all the way back now
to your cheek. That's right.

19
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,296
Keep both eyes open.

20
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,257
And, loose!

21
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,386
I missed.
Go and fetch it, then.

22
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,691
A bow, Fergus? She's a lady.

23
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,809
Ooh! You!

24
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,269
A will-o'-the-wisp.

25
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,692
They are real.

26
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,286
Elinor:
Merida, come along, sweetheart.

27
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,500
We're leaving now.
Merida: I saw a wisp.

28
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,626
I saw a wisp.
A wisp?

29
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:46,015
You know, some say that
will-o'-the-wisps lead you to your fate.

30
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,558
Oh, aye. Or an arrow.
Och!

31
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,637
Come on, let's be off before we see
a dancing Tatty Bogle.

32
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,144
Or a giant having a jigger
in the bluebells.

33
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,145
Your father doesn't believe in magic.

34
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,651
Well, he should. Because it's true.

35
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,364
Mor'du! Elinor, run!

36
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,408
Sirel

37
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,167
Come on, you!

38
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,802
Merida: Some say our destiny
is tied to the land...

39
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,347
As much a part of us as we are of it.

40
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,529
Others say fate is woven together
like a cloth.

41
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,367
So that one's destiny intertwines
with many others.

42
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,373
It's the one thing we search for
or fight to change.

43
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,164
Some never find it.

44
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,544
But there are some who are led.

45
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,301
The story of how my father lost his leg

46
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,917
to the demon bear Mor'du
became legend.

47
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,689
I became a sister fo three new brothers.

48
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,730
The princes.
Hamish, Hubert and Harris.

49
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,740
Wee devils, more like.

50
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,319
They get away with murder.

51
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,654
I can never get away with anything.

52
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,662
I'm the Princess.

53
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,368
Oh!

54
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,412
Merida: I'm the example.

55
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,425
I've got duties, responsibilities,
expectations.

56
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,298
My whole life is planned out,

57
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,345
preparing for the day I become...

58
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,842
Well, my mother.

59
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,767
She's in charge
of every single day of my life.

60
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,724
Aye, Robin, jolly Robin,
and thou shalt know of mine.

61
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,892
Project!

62
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,893
And thou shalt know of mine!

63
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,522
Enunciate. You must be understood
from anywhere in the room,

64
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,232
or it's all for naught.

65
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,777
This is all for naught.
I heard that!

66
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,408
From the top.

67
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,414
A Princess must be knowledgeable
about her kingdom.

68
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,952
She does not doodle.

69
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,582
That's a c, dear.

70
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,390
A Princess does not chortle.

71
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,512
Mm!
Does not stuff her gob!

72
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,310
Rises early.

73
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,183
Is compassionate...

74
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,684
Patient, cautious,

75
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,775
clean.

76
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:48,815
And above all, a Princess
strives for... well, perfection.

77
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,988
Merida: But every once in a while,

78
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,830
there's a day
when I don't have to be a Princess.

79
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,918
No lessons, no expectations.

80
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,337
A day where anything can happen.

81
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,918
A day I can change my fate.

82
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,218
Yah!

83
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:27,062
When cold wind is a' calling,
and the sky is clear and bright

84
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:32,821
misty mountains sing and beckon,
lead me out into the light

85
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,161
[ will ride, I will fly

86
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,198
chase the wind and touch the sky

87
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,916
I will fly
chase the wind and touch the sky

88
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,044
\whoo-hoo!

89
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:06,393
Where dark woods hide secrets
ahd mountains are fierce and bold

90
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:12,447
deep waters hold reflections
of times lost long ago

91
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:16,493
I will read every story,
take hold of my own dream

92
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,570
on!

93
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,740
Be as strong as the seas are stormy

94
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,580
and proud as an eagle's scream

95
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,587
[ will ride, I will fly

96
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,586
chase the wind and touch the sky

97
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:36,422
I will fly
chase the wind and touch the sky

98
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,941
And touch the sky

99
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,020
whoo!

100
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,280
Chase the wind

101
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,317
chase the wind

102
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:02,577
touch the sky

103
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,339
I'm starving. You hungry too, Angus?

104
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,804
Pfft!

105
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,845
Oats it is, then.

106
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,721
Good day, Princess.

107
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,676
I cannot find the salt.
Where did you put it?

108
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,172
It was over there a minute ago,
the last time I looked at it.

109
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:31,735
And then, out of nowhere,
the biggest bear you've ever seen!

110
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,984
His hide littered with the weapons
of fallen warriors.

111
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,651
His face scarred with one dead eye.

112
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,069
I drew my sword and...

113
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,700
Whoosh!

114
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,907
One swipe, his sword shattered.

115
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,118
Then chomp! Dad's leg was clean off.

116
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,871
Down the monster's throat it went.

117
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,877
Oh, that's my favorite part.

118
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,210
Mor'du has never been seen since,

119
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:02,808
and is roaming the wilds
waiting his chance of revenge.

120
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,343
Let him return.

121
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,520
I'll finish what I guddled
in the first place.

122
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,353
Merida, a Princess does not place
her weapons on the table.

123
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,652
Mum! It's just my bow.

124
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,689
A Princess should not have weapons
in my opinion.

125
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,073
Fergus: Leave her be.

126
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,031
Princess or not,
learning to fight is essential.

127
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,909
Mum?
You'll never guess what I did today.

128
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,160
Hm?
I climbed the crone's tooth,

129
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,703
and drank from the fire falls.

130
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,664
Fire falls?

131
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,501
They say only the ancient kings
were brave enough to drink the fire.

132
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,422
What did you do, dear?
Nothing, mum.

133
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,969
Hungry, aren't we?

134
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,422
Mum!
You'll get dreadful collywobbles.

135
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,509
Oh, Fergus, will you look at
your daughter's plate?

136
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,553
So what?

137
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,096
Oh, you great...
Don't let them lick...

138
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,522
Boys, you're naughty.

139
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,650
Don't just play with your haggis.

140
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,690
Urgh!
Och, how do you know you don't like it,

141
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,821
if you won't try it?

142
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,739
That's just a wee sheep's stomach.

143
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,443
It's delicious. Mm!

144
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,824
My lady.
Thank you, Maudie.

145
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,755
Fergus: You're getting too big,
the two of you.

146
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,081
Elinor: Aha.

147
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,539
From the lords macintosh,
macguffin and Dingwall.

148
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,957
Their responses, no doubt.

149
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,587
Aye, aye!

150
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,627
Fergus: Hey, hey!

151
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,176
Stay out of my food,
you greedy mongrels.

152
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,967
Chew on that, you manky dogs!

153
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,097
Fergus?

154
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,855
They've all accepted.

155
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,819
Who's accepted what, mother?

156
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,113
Boys, you are excused.

157
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,067
Oof!

158
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,031
Hey!

159
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,831
What did I do now?

160
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,125
Your father has something
to discuss with you.

161
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,791
Fergus?

162
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,498
Oh.

163
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,719
Er... Merida.

164
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:11,888
The lords are presenting
their sons as suitors for your betrothal.

165
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,814
What?
The clans have accepted.

166
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,976
Dad!
What? I...

167
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,190
You... she... Elinor?

168
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,863
Honestly, Merida, I don't know why
you're reacting this way.

169
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,986
This year, each clan will present a suitor
to compete in the games for your hand.

170
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,781
I suppose a Princess
just does what she's told?

171
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,245
A Princess does not raise her voice.

172
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,124
Merida, this is what you've been
preparing for your whole life.

173
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,087
No, it's what you've been preparing
me for my whole life.

174
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,509
I won't go through with it.
You can't make me.

175
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,712
Merida!

176
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,763
Huh? Merida!

177
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Urgh!

178
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,845
Boys!

179
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,736
Mother. Suitors? Marriage?

180
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,189
Once there was an ancient kingdom...

181
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,858
Oh, mum!

182
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,568
Ancient kingdom.

183
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,699
Its name long forgotten,

184
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,284
ruled by a wise and fair king
who was much beloved.

185
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,789
And when he grew old he divided
the kingdom among his four sons,

186
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:25,252
that they should be the pillars
on which the peace of the land rested.

187
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,679
But the oldest prince
wanted to rule the land for himself.

188
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,312
He followed his own path
and the kingdom fell

189
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,565
to war, and chaos and ruin.

190
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,563
That's a nice story.

191
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,895
It's not just a story, Merida.

192
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,073
Legends are lessons.
They ring with truths.

193
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,574
Och, mum.

194
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,868
I would advise you
to make your peace with this.

195
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,744
The clans are coming
to present their suitors.

196
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,164
It's not fair.
Och, Merida.

197
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,993
It's marriage.
It's not the end of the world.

198
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,470
Fergus: You're muttering.
I don't mutter.

199
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,387
Aye, you do. You mutter, lass,
when something's troubling you.

200
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,726
I blame you. Stubbornness.

201
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,458
It's entirely from your side of the family.

202
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,349
I take it the talk
didn't go too well, then?

203
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,934
Och, I don't know what to do.

204
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,066
Speak to her, dear.
I do speak to her.

205
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,403
She just doesn't listen.
Come on, now.

206
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,026
Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me.

207
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,077
What would you say?

208
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,614
Och... I can't do this.

209
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,290
Sure you can.

210
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,960
There, there. That's my queen.

211
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,003
Right, here we go.

212
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,797
I don't want to get married.

213
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,341
I want to stay single
and let my hair flow in the wind

214
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,341
as I ride through the Glen
firing arrows into the sunset.

215
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:01,765
Merida, all this work,
all the time spent preparing you,

216
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,436
schooling you,
giving you everything we never had.

217
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,154
I ask you, what do you expect us to do?

218
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,325
Call off the gathering.
Would that kill them?

219
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,743
You're the queen.

220
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,163
You can just tell the lords
the Princess is not ready for this.

221
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,871
In fact, she might not ever be ready
for this, so that's that.

222
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:25,001
Good day to you. We'll expect your
declarations of war in the morning.

223
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,800
I understand this must all seem unfair.

224
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,177
Even I had reservations
when I faced betrothal.

225
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,714
But we can't just run away
from who we are.

226
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,300
I don't want my life to be over.

227
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,763
I want my freedom!

228
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,097
But are you willing to pay the price
your freedom will cost?

229
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,307
I'm not doing any of this to hurt you.

230
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,900
If you could just try to see what I do,
I do out of love.

231
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,949
But it's my life, it's...

232
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,109
I'm just not ready.

233
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,069
I think you'd see, if you could just...

234
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,202
I think I could make you understand
if you would just...

235
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,874
Listen.
__listen.

236
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,377
I swear, Angus,
this isn't going to happen.

237
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,000
Not if I have any say in it.

238
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,318
Macguffin!

239
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,895
Men: Macguffin!

240
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,817
Dingwall!
Men: Dingwall!

241
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,450
Macintosh!
Men: Macintosh!

242
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,246
Ooh! Aah!

243
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,841
Oh.

244
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,929
You look absolutely beautiful.

245
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,301
I can't breathe.

246
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,383
Och, shush! Give us a turn.

247
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,140
I can't move.

248
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,268
It's too tight.

249
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,101
It's perfect.

250
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,036
Merida? Mum?

251
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,954
Just...

252
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,833
Remember to smile.

253
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,311
Aye, they're coming.

254
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,688
Places, everyone. Places.

255
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,772
Ohl

256
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,170
I look fine, woman! Leave me be!

257
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,838
Guard: My lord!

258
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,167
I want to announce the arrival
of the lords...

259
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,256
Ow!
Who goes there? Who goes there?

260
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,980
Boy!

261
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,080
So, here we are... er...

262
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,041
The four clans.
Man: Aye.

263
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,123
Er... gathering...
Oh.

264
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,042
For...

265
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,675
The presentation of the suitors.
The presentation of the suitors.

266
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,469
Fergus: Clan macintosh.

267
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,892
Men: Macintosh!

268
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,517
Your majesty,
I present my heir and scion,

269
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,058
who defended our land
from the northern invaders,

270
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,317
and with his own sword, stab blooder,

271
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,568
vanquished 1,000 foes.

272
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,609
Men: Macintosh!

273
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,827
Fergus: Clan macguffin!

274
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,576
Men: Macguffin!

275
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:32,585
Good majesty, I present my eldest son,

276
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,459
who scuttled the viking longships

277
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,259
and with his bare hands
vanquished 2,000 foes.

278
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,504
Men: Macguffin!

279
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,552
Clan Dingwall.

280
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,593
Men: Dingwall!

281
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,772
I present my only son

282
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,394
who was besieged by 10,000 romans

283
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:02,690
and he took out a whole armada
singlehandedly.

284
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,283
With one arm, he was...

285
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,286
With one arm he was steering the ship

286
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,449
and with the other
he held his mighty sword

287
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,286
and struck down a whole attacking fleet.

288
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,704
Man: Lies! What? I heard that.

289
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,957
Go on. Say it to my face.

290
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,963
Or are ye scared, simpering jackanapes,

291
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,340
afraid to muss your pretty hair?

292
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,595
At least we have hair.
And all our teeth.

293
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,052
Man: Huh?

294
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,640
And we don't hide under Bridges,
you grumpy old troll.

295
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,271
You want to laugh, huh?

296
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,485
Wee Dingwall!

297
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,776
Get off me!

298
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,006
Nut 'em! Nut 'em! That's the way to...

299
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,380
All right.

300
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,717
Shut it!

301
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,770
Now, that's all done.
You've had your go at each other.

302
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,685
Show a little decorum.

303
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,771
And no more fighting.

304
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,376
Ow!

305
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,094
Fergus: You want a fresh one?

306
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,339
Fergus: Crivens, you're fierce.

307
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,728
I didn't start it. It was...

308
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,443
My lady queen, I feel terrible.
My humblest apologies.

309
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:10,118
We mean no disrespect.
I'm sorry, love, I didn't... but...

310
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,320
Yes, dear.

311
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,200
Now, where were we?

312
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,868
Ah, yes. In accordance with our laws,

313
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,460
by the rights of our heritage,

314
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,790
only the firstborn of each
of the great leaders

315
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,751
may be presented as champion.
Firstborn?

316
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:31,514
And thus compete for the hand
of the Princess of dun broch.

317
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,434
To win the fair maiden
they must prove their worth

318
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,643
by feats of strength or arms
in the games.

319
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:44,397
It is customary that the challenge
be determined by the Princess herself.

320
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,152
Archery! Archery.

321
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:52,405
I choose archery.

322
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,326
Let the games begin!

323
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,226
Pull!

324
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,687
Pull!

325
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,156
I'll just take one.
Ooh!

326
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,410
Prince: Ooh!

327
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,545
Ohl

328
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:49,171
now, I have told you,
you're not allowed... oh!

329
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,672
On!
Argh!

330
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,879
Oh!

331
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,023
It's time!

332
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,945
Archers, to your marks!
Aye, archers, to your marks.

333
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,869
And may the lucky arrow find its target.

334
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,926
Oil get on with it.

335
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,226
Crowd: Ooh.

336
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,565
Och!
I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.

337
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,568
Or holding up Bridges.
Shh!

338
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,653
Crowd: Aw...

339
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,409
At least you hit the target, son.

340
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,787
Oh, that's attractive.

341
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,705
Man: I got it!
Good arm.

342
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,875
And such lovely flowing locks.

343
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,543
Fergus. “What?

344
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,429
Oh, wee lamb.

345
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,608
Oh, come on! Shoot, boy!

346
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,775
Well done, lad! Well done.

347
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,452
Feast your eyes!

348
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,036
That's my boy.

349
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,789
Well, that's just grand now, isn't it?

350
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,629
Guess who's coming to dinner?
Fergus.

351
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,795
By the way, hope you don't mind
being called lady ding...

352
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,642
I am Merida.

353
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,933
Firstborn descendant of
clan dun broch.

354
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,478
And I'll be shooting for my own hand.

355
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,688
Oh!

356
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,024
What are you doing?

357
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,745
Merida!

358
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,697
Curse this dress!

359
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,544
Merida, stop this!

360
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,680
Don't you dare loose another arrow.

361
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,104
Merida, I forbid it.

362
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,554
Michty me!
I've just about had enough of you, lass!

363
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,310
You're the one that wants me to...
You embarrassed them.

364
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,229
You embarrassed me.
I followed the rules.

365
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,227
You don't know what you've done!

366
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,922
Just don't care how I...
It'll be fire and sword if it's not set right.

367
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,483
Just listen!
I am the queen!

368
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,110
You listen to me!

369
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,486
Ugh! This is so unfair!

370
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,284
Ha! Unfair?

371
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,407
You're never there for me.

372
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,160
This whole marriage is what you want.

373
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,414
Do you ever bother
to ask what I want? No.

374
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,337
You walk around telling me what to do,
what not to do,

375
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,915
trying to make me be like you.

376
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,296
Well, I'm not going to be like you.

377
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,093
Oh, you're acting like a child.

378
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,972
And you're a beast.

379
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,969
That's what you are!
Oh, Merida.

380
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,426
I'll never be like you.
No, stop that!

381
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,471
I'd rather die than be like you!

382
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,603
Merida, you are a Princess,

383
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,443
and I expect you to act like one.
Mum!

384
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,154
Ohl

385
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,867
Elinor: Merida!

386
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,369
Merida!

387
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,254
Oh, dear.

388
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,131
Ah!

389
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,594
Oh, no. What have I done?

390
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,551
Oh.

391
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,247
Oh! Oh! Ohl!

392
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,589
Whoa!

393
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,042
Angus!

394
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,383
Come on, Angus.

395
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,683
Angus!

396
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,026
Why would the wisps lead me here?

397
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,580
Uh...

398
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,136
Oh, look around.

399
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,385
You holler if you see anything you like.

400
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,808
Everything is half off.

401
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,347
Uh...

402
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,275
Who are you?
Just a humble woodcarver.

403
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,810
Um...

404
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,651
I don't understand...

405
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,815
See anything you like?
Uh...

406
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,203
Perhaps a touch of whimsy
to brighten any dank chamber?

407
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,701
But the will-o'-the-wisps, they...

408
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,783
Oh! This is one of a kind!

409
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,830
I'll make you a deal for this rare prize.

410
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,583
Your broom!
Oh!

411
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,876
It was sweeping by itself.
That's ridiculous.

412
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,670
Wood cannot be imbued
with magical properties.

413
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,257
I should know. I'm a wit... whittler.

414
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,138
Of wood.

415
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:24,477
Oh, how about this conversation starter?
It's made of yew wood.

416
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,858
Tough as stone.

417
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,355
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah!

418
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,487
That's stuffed.

419
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,820
Staring is rude.
Ooh! The crow's talking!

420
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,154
That's not all I can do.

421
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,489
La-la la-la [a-la

422
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,837
You're a witch!
Woodcarver.

423
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,214
That's why the wisps led me here.

424
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,754
Woodcarver!
You'll change my fate!

425
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,632
Woodcarver!
You see, it's my mother.

426
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,806
I'm not a witch!
Too many unsatisfied customers.

427
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:05,188
If you're not going to buy anything,
get out.

428
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,400
No! The wisps led me here!
I don't care!

429
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:14,156
Get out! Shoo! Get! Be gone with you!
I'll buy it all.

430
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,450
What? What was that?
Every carving.

431
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,243
Well...

432
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:23,578
And how are you going
to pay for that, sweetie?

433
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,330
With this. “W...

434
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,836
Oh, my, that's lovely, that is.

435
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,258
That would set us up for months.

436
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,715
Merida: Ah, ah, ah.

437
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:42,601
Every carving and one spell.

438
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,313
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

439
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,937
I want a spell to change my mum.

440
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,481
That'll change my fate.

441
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,857
Hmm... done!

442
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,773
Where are you going?

443
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,568
There.

444
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,952
What are you doing?

445
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,955
You never conjure where you carve.

446
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,616
Very important.

447
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,747
Witch: The last time I did this
was for a prince.

448
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,754
Easy on the eyes. Tight pants.

449
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,467
He demanded I give him
the strength of ten men.

450
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,758
And he gave me this for a spell.

451
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,518
A spell that would change his fate.

452
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,850
And did he get what he was after?

453
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,603
Yes.

454
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,770
And made off with an especially
attractive mahogany cheese board.

455
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,610
Now, what do I need? Oh!

456
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,695
Just a little bit of this.

457
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,786
Ah.

458
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,870
Hoo!

459
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,832
Tee-tee-tee-tee. Whoosh.

460
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,659
That'll do.

461
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,677
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi.

462
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:13,518
And now let's see. What have we here?

463
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,359
On!

464
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,489
Hey!

465
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,367
Uh, a cake?

466
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,447
You don't want it?
Yes! I want it.

467
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,084
You're sure if I give this to my mum,

468
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,085
it will change my fate?

469
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,917
Oh.

470
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:38,296
Trust me. It'll do the trick, dearie.

471
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,839
Expect delivery of your purchase
within a fortnight.

472
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,883
Ooh! Ooh...

473
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,977
What was that thing about the spell?

474
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,643
Did you say something about

475
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,726
the spell?

476
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,734
Mor'du, mordu, now the time has
come for all of us to slaughter you

477
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,496
all: Hooray!

478
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,990
Mor'du, Mor'du...

479
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,758
Elinor: Merida.
Mum!

480
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,683
Ooh, uh... l, uh...

481
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,888
Oh, I've been worried sick.
You... you were?

482
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,479
I didn't know where you'd gone
or when you'd come back.

483
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,436
I didn't know what to think.
Oh, look at your dress.

484
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,443
Oh. Angus threw me. But I'm not hurt.

485
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:46,610
Well, you're home now,
so that's the end of it.

486
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,955
Honestly?
I've pacified the lords for now.

487
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,000
Your father's out there
entertaining them.

488
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,918
Come taste my blade, you manky bear

489
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,625
for gobbling up my leg

490
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,792
I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you,
hang your noggin on a peg...

491
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,973
Of course, we both know
a decision still has to be made.

492
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,771
What's this?
It's a peace offering.

493
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,979
I made it. For you. Special.

494
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,936
You made this for me?

495
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,692
Mm.

496
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,406
Oh. Interesting flavor.

497
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,489
How do you feel?
What... what is that?

498
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,157
Different?
Mm...

499
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,707
Tart and, um, gamy.

500
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,506
Have you changed your mind at all
about the marriage and all that?

501
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh, that's better.

502
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,586
Now, why don't we go
upstairs to the lords

503
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,593
and put this whole kerfuffle to rest?

504
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,015
Hm?

505
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,727
Ooh.

506
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,651
Mother?
I'm woozy suddenly.

507
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,153
My head's spinning like a top. Ooh!

508
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,987
Mum!
Oh, suddenly I'm not so well.

509
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:11,870
Er... how... how do you feel
about the marriage now?

510
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,993
Merida! Oh, just take me to my room.

511
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,659
Fergus: All right, that's fine.
That's just fine.

512
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,546
A little to the left. That's good.
A wee bit to the left. That's good.

513
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,089
It's good enough.

514
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,736
Now, clear out of there, boys.
I don't want you to spoil my shot.

515
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,007
What?
My lady queen.

516
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,014
We've been waiting patiently.

517
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:36,053
Milords, I am out of sorts
at the moment.

518
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,935
But you shall have your answer.

519
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,516
Oh!
Eh?

520
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,560
Presently.

521
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,571
Now, if you'll excuse us.

522
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,858
Fergus: Elinor, look!

523
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,902
It's Mor'du!

524
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,446
Elinor? Are you all right, dear?

525
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,407
Fine. I'm fine.

526
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,746
Go about avenging your leg. Oh...

527
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,878
Aye. You heard her, lads.

528
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:06,041
I dream about the perfect way
to make this devil die.

529
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:13,431
Just take all the time you need
to getting yourself right, mum.

530
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:17,477
Then maybe in a bit you might have
something new to say on the marriage.

531
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,976
What was in that cake?

532
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,647
Cake.

533
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,068
Mum?

534
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,775
So I'll just tell them
the wedding's off, then?

535
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,862
Mum?

536
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,980
Bear!

537
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,799
_oh!

538
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,804
Mum?

539
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,805
You're... you're a bear!

540
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,309
Why a bear?

541
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,563
Oh, that scaffy witch
gave me a gammy spell.

542
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,949
It's not my fault.

543
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,027
I didn't ask her
to change you into a bear.

544
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,699
I just wanted her to change you.

545
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,214
Shh. Did you hear that?

546
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,542
Something's not right.

547
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,223
There's no point in having a go at me.
The witch is to blame.

548
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,634
Goggly old hag.

549
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,812
Eyes all over the place.

550
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,894
Unbelievable.

551
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,686
I'll get her to fix this.

552
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,500
Merida: Why do I always get blamed
for everything? It's just not fair.

553
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,070
Everybody, follow me.

554
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,155
And keep a sharp eye.

555
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,535
Here we go.
Another hunt through the castle.

556
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,248
But we haven't had dessert yet.

557
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,585
I have no idea.

558
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,213
Merida: Mum, you can't go out there.

559
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,634
Mum! Wait!

560
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:08,140
What are you doing?
Dad. The bear king?

561
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,395
If he so much as sees you, you're dead.

562
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,271
Lord Dingwall: Another one of
your entertainments to bore us to death!

563
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,926
Lord macintosh:
Oh, and what exactly are we after...

564
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,950
Mum!

565
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,900
Lord macintosh: My liege?

566
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,116
Lord macguffin: Best to humor him.
He is, after all, the king.

567
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,410
He's like a hound with that nose of his.

568
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,712
Mum, wait.

569
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,209
We have to...

570
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,667
Follow me.

571
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,377
Stop.

572
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,673
Stop!

573
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,179
You're covered with fur.

574
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,976
You're not naked.

575
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,978
It's not like anyone's gonna see you.

576
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,859
Now you've done it.

577
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,071
Maudie!

578
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,869
Just calm down, lass. What is it?

579
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,117
Spit it out, Maudie!

580
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,998
A bear!

581
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,701
I knew it!

582
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,836
Would you just listen to me?

583
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,749
We can't go this way. You'll be seen.

584
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,128
Quick! This way!

585
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:20,514
Mum?

586
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,445
Mum? Oh!

587
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,112
Oh!

588
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,168
Hm?

589
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,423
A witch turned mum into a bear.
It's not my fault.

590
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,879
We've got to get out of the castle.
I need your help.

591
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,172
Oh, all right.

592
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,514
You can have my desserts
for two... three weeks.

593
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,347
Okay. Fine. A year.

594
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,192
Did you hear that?
Shh.

595
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,198
There it goes!

596
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,397
Fergus: Come on, lads!

597
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,342
There it goes!

598
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,275
Come on, mum.

599
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,260
Lord macguffin:
Think we should lay a trap?

600
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,990
Fergus: Try shutting yours!

601
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,370
There he is!

602
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,464
Fergus: I'm sure it went this way.

603
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,158
Lord macguffin:
You can see my house from here.

604
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,138
It must have sprouted wings.

605
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:31,347
Was carried away by a giant birdy.

606
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,429
A dragon, perhaps.
Bear in the castle!

607
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,848
Doesn't make sense.
It cannot open doors.

608
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,808
He's got big giant paws!

609
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,268
Let's just get inside.

610
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,155
It's locked.
Dingwall was the last up.

611
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,404
Lord Dingwall:
I propped it open with a stick.

612
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:57,160
Handmaid: What did you see, Maudie?
Just spit it out, Maudie.

613
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,792
Oh, for goodness' sakes, Maudie,
would you get a grip?

614
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,304
Handmaid: Maudie, honey, come here!
It's all right!

615
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,010
Come on, mum. Quick.

616
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,429
Shh.

617
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,161
They'll be fine. Won't you, boys?

618
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,991
Mum, we've got to hurry.

619
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,500
Now, I'll be back soon.

620
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,834
Go on and help yourself
to anything you want, as a reward.

621
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,429
On!

622
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,356
Right!

623
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,574
Merida: Where are these wisps?

624
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,952
Come out, wisps. Come on out.

625
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,165
Lead me to the witch's cottage.

626
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,286
I'm here!

627
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,798
Fine. Don't come out
now that my mum's watching.

628
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:32,005
I was standing right here
and the wisp appeared right there.

629
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,512
Then a whole trail of them
led me off into the forest.

630
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:45,943
Oh, does she think we're just going
to happen upon the witch's cottage?

631
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,167
Oh, mum, I know this place.

632
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,669
The witch's cottage...

633
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,629
It's this way! Come on! Hurry!

634
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,978
I can't believe it. I found it.

635
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:28,270
No. She was here.

636
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,403
No, really, she was just here.

637
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,450
Oh, wait.

638
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,162
No.

639
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,666
No, no. No! No!

640
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,007
_oh.

641
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,481
Welcome to the crafty carver,

642
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:17,026
home of bear-themed carvings
and novelties.

643
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,196
I am completely out of stock at this time.

644
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:25,581
But if you'd like to enquire about
portraits or wedding cake toppers,

645
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,627
pour vial one into the cauldron.

646
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,377
If you'd like the menu in Gaelic, vial two.

647
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,301
If you're that red-haired lass, vial three.

648
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,719
To speak with a live homunculus...

649
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,258
Princess, I'm off to the Wickerman
festival in stornoway

650
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,343
and won't be back till spring.

651
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,059
There's one bit I forgot to tell you
about the spell.

652
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,976
By the second sunrise,
your spell will be permanent,

653
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:54,404
unless you remember these words.

654
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,491
Fate be changed,

655
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,534
look inside,

656
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,491
mend the bond

657
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,618
torn by pride.

658
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,748
Fate be changed... mend the bond.
What does that mean?

659
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,544
One more time.

660
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,455
Fate be changed,

661
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,586
look inside,

662
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,463
mend the bond

663
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:18,091
torn by pride.

664
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,547
That's it. Ta-fa.

665
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,468
Oh, and thank you for shopping
at the crafty carver.

666
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,224
No. No! Where'd you go?

667
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,764
Welcome to the crafty carver...
“What?

668
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,100
For all your...

669
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:35,442
Maybe there's a book of spells.
Look around. We'll need more vials.

670
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:40,363
I'm off to the Wickerman festival
in stornoway...

671
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,369
Thank you for visiting.
Have a lovely day.

672
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,613
We'll sort it out tomorrow.

673
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,247
Oh.

674
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,297
My brave wee Lassie, I'm here.

675
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,376
I'll always be right here.

676
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,779
Uh... good morning.

677
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,950
So...

678
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,412
What's all this supposed to be?

679
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,243
Oh.

680
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,251
What?

681
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,926
Sorry. I don't speak bear.

682
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,512
Oh.

683
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,355
Ah!

684
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,617
Find those by the creek, did you?
Mm-hm.

685
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,073
They're nightshade berries.

686
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,907
Mmm.

687
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,243
They're poisonous.

688
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,842
Where did you get this water?
It has worms.

689
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:01,606
Come on.

690
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,823
Breakfast.

691
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:17,581
Oh, wait. A Princess should not
have weapons, in your opinion.

692
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,453
Uh-huh...

693
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,916
There you go.

694
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,836
Go on.

695
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,342
How do you know you don't like it
if you won't try it?

696
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,272
Mm.

697
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:05,462
This love it is a distant star

698
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:09,670
guiding us home wherever we are

699
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,759
this love it is a burning sun

700
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,309
shining light on the things
that we've done

701
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:26,070
I tried to speak to you every day

702
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:33,073
but each word we spoke
the wind blew away

703
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,413
how did we let it come lo this?

704
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,579
What we just tasted...

705
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:53,506
How will it feel when this day is done?

706
00:55:53,851 --> 00:56:00,814
And can we keep
what we've only begun?

707
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:08,275
Could these walls
come crumbling down?

708
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:15,445
I want to feel my feet on the ground

709
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:21,205
can we carry this love that we share

710
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:27,047
into the open air

711
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:34,964
into the open air

712
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,426
hey!

713
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,471
Where are you going?

714
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:53,233
This love it is a burning sun

715
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,825
mum, come back.

716
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,666
Uh...

717
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:04,789
Oh...

718
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,875
Mum, is that you?

719
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,763
Uh... mum?

720
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,514
You changed.

721
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,019
Like you were a...

722
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,403
I mean, like you were a bear
on the inside.

723
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,781
A wisp.

724
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,538
Mum!

725
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,578
Stop it!

726
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,209
Mum, no!

727
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,543
Mum...

728
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,055
Jings, crivens, help ma boab.

729
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:04,595
Mum, I know you're scared,

730
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,682
you're tired, you don't understand,

731
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,976
but we've got to keep our heads.

732
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,483
Just calm down.

733
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,982
Listen.

734
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,935
They'll show us the way.

735
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,003
Merida: Mum, look.

736
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,645
Merida: Why did the wisps
bring us here?

737
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,171
Whoever they were,
they've been gone for a long, long time.

738
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,676
I'm fine, mum.

739
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,135
Just fine.

740
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,814
It's, uh,

741
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,780
a throne room.

742
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,284
You suppose this could've
been the kingdom

743
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:27,078
in that story you were telling me?

744
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,998
The one with the princes.

745
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,378
One,

746
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:36,754
two,

747
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,332
three,

748
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,216
four.

749
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,168
The oldest.

750
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,303
Split, like the tapestry.

751
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,274
The spell. It's happened before.

752
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:03,357
Strength of ten men.

753
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,910
Fate be changed.

754
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,949
Changed his fate.

755
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,705
Oh, no.

756
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,790
The prince became...

757
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,670
Mor'du.

758
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,828
Mum, we need to get back to the castle.

759
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,791
If we don't hurry,
you'll become like Mor'du.

760
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,201
A bear!

761
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,457
A real bear. Forever!

762
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,299
Mend the bond torn by pride.

763
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:48,713
The witch gave us the answer.
The tapestry.

764
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:01,191
Mum, do you have a better idea?

765
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,827
That'll do.

766
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,227
No more talk. No more traditions.

767
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,683
We settle this now!

768
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,314
You're the king.

769
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:45,314
You decide which one of our sons
your daughter will marry.

770
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:48,488
None of your sons
are fit to marry my daughter.

771
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,567
Then our alliance is over!
This means war!

772
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,080
They're gonna murder each other.

773
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,583
You've got to stop them
before it's too late.

774
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,790
I know, I know!

775
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:06,589
But how do we get you through there
and up to the tapestry

776
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,670
with the lot of them
boiling over like that?

777
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,215
_oh!

778
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,399
What are you doing, lass?
It's all right, dad.

779
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,113
I, um...

780
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,203
I have...

781
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,790
Well, you see, I...

782
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,451
I have been in conference
with the queen.

783
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,417
Is that so?
Aye, it is.

784
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,707
Well, where is she, then?
She, uh...

785
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,918
How do we know that
this isn't some trick?

786
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,801
I'd never...
This is highly irregular.

787
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,800
What are you playing at?
Where is the queen?

788
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,495
Lord macintosh: We will not stand
for any more of this jiggery-pokery.

789
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,680
That's right. Let's see her.
Shut it!

790
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,645
Well, I, uh...

791
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:11,824
Uh...

792
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,905
Once there was an ancient kingdom.

793
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,827
What is this?

794
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,414
That kingdom fell into war

795
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,587
and chaos and ruin...

796
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,757
Och, we've all heard that tale.
Lost kingdom.

797
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,425
Aye, but it's true.

798
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:36,175
I know now how one selfish act
can turn the fate of a kingdom.

799
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:37,660
Lord macguffin:
Bah, it's just a legend.

800
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,424
Legends are lessons.

801
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,310
They ring with truths.

802
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,937
Our kingdom is young.

803
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,307
Our stories are not yet legend.

804
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,523
But in them, our bond was struck.

805
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,688
Our clans were once enemies.

806
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,115
But when invaders threatened us
from the sea,

807
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,194
you joined together to defend our lands.

808
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,409
You fought for each other.

809
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,456
You risked everything for each other.

810
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,790
Lord macguffin, my dad saved your life,

811
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:10,418
stopping an arrow
as you ran to Dingwall's aid.

812
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,339
Aye, and I'll never forget it.

813
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,046
Merida: And, lord macintosh,

814
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:17,470
you saved my dad
when you charged in on heavy horse

815
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,263
and held off the advance.

816
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:23,389
And we all know how lord Dingwall
broke the enemy line.

817
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,562
With a mighty throw of his spear!

818
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:27,518
I was aiming at you, you big tumshie.

819
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,727
The story of this kingdom
is a powerful one.

820
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,362
My dad rallied your forces

821
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,774
and you made him your king.

822
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,953
It was an alliance forged in bravery
and friendship

823
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,780
and it lives to this day.

824
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,837
But I've been selfish.

825
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,962
I tore a great rift in our kingdom.

826
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,885
There's no one to blame but me.

827
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:02,432
And I know now
that I need to amend my mistake

828
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,264
and mend our bond.

829
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:10,648
And so, there is the matter
of my betrothal.

830
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:15,403
I've decided to do what's right

831
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,608
and...

832
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,065
And...

833
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,492
And...

834
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:25,614
Break tradition.

835
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,837
My mother...

836
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,796
The queen, feels...

837
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,634
Uh, in her heart

838
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,635
that I...

839
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:48,015
That we be free to...

840
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,983
Write our own story...

841
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,980
Follow our hearts

842
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:03,569
and find love in our own time.

843
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,416
That's beautiful.

844
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,870
The queen and I put the decision
to you, my lords.

845
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,670
Might our young people decide
for themselves who they will love?

846
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,755
Huh?

847
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:23,009
Well, since you've obviously
made up your minds about this,

848
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,013
I have one thing to say.

849
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,638
This is...
A grand ideal

850
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,019
give us our own say
in choosing our fate.

851
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,397
What?
Aye. Why shouldn't we choose?

852
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,562
But she's the Princess.

853
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,645
I did not pick her out. It was your idea.

854
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:41,940
And you... you feel the same way?

855
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,538
Good?

856
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,706
Well, that settles it.

857
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:58,540
Let these lads try and win her heart
before they win her hand.

858
01:08:58,593 --> 01:08:59,924
If they can.

859
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:03,003
I say, the wee Dingwall
has a fighting chance.

860
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,513
Fine, then. Seems for once we agree.

861
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,595
It was my idea in the first place.

862
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,524
Just like your mum.

863
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:21,858
You devil.

864
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:30,575
Uh... everyone to the cellar!

865
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:35,081
Let's crack open the king's
private reserve to celebrate!

866
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,208
Oh.

867
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

868
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,925
Psst. Bring the tiny glasses.

869
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,274
Oh, the tapestry!

870
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,563
Mend the bond...

871
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,900
Mend the bond.

872
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,740
Stitch it up. This'll change you back.

873
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,121
We just need needle and thread.

874
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,671
Mum?

875
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,166
Mum? Not now.

876
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:26,924
No. Please, not now.

877
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,805
Mum...

878
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,091
_shh.

879
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:44,187
Elinor, dear, you'll never guess
who just solved our little suitor problem.

880
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,416
Elinor!

881
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:04,007
It can't be true!
Elinor, answer me, lass!

882
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,167
Elinor!

883
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,595
Merida.

884
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,014
What?
Dad, no! It's not what you think.

885
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,141
Merida, get back!
No!

886
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,274
No, dad! Don't hurt her!

887
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,151
Get out of here!

888
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,813
Merida! No!

889
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,278
No!

890
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,712
Mum.

891
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:51,546
It's all right. I'm all right. It's
nothing. It's just a little scratch. Mum!

892
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,597
My liege!

893
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,094
Fergus.

894
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,018
Bear!

895
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,100
Dad!

896
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,728
Count your stars, lass.
It almost had you. Are you hurt?

897
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,559
It's your wife, Elinor.

898
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,817
Close the gate!

899
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,362
You're talking nonsense!
It's the truth!

900
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,622
There was a witch and she
gave me a spell. It's not Mor'du.

901
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,121
Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother!

902
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:25,171
I'll not risk losing you, too.
Merida: No, dad! Just listen to me.

903
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,920
Listen! You can't!

904
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:32,303
It's your wife Elinor!
Maudie, keep this and don't let her out.

905
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,843
What about the bear?
Just stay put.

906
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,761
Oh...

907
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,790
Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots!
Yah!

908
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,046
Mum!

909
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,722
No.

910
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,345
No. Mum.

911
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,909
Maudie. Maudie!

912
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,663
I need youl!

913
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,168
Now!

914
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,791
Oh, no.

915
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:55,090
Maudie.

916
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:01,846
Get the key.

917
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,571
Yah!

918
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,406
Oh, Maudie!

919
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:32,211
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.
Needle and thread.

920
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,059
There he goes!

921
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,816
Needle and thread.
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.

922
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,147
Ah, you beauty!

923
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:26,185
One, two... huh?

924
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,940
_maudie: Oh!

925
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:57,591
Steady, Hamish.

926
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,627
Fergus: There he goes.

927
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,765
Fergus: We've got his track!

928
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,691
Back, back, back!
Get him!

929
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,611
Angus! Easy, laddie.

930
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,990
Hubert, Harris, help Hamish.

931
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,853
Fergus: Watch your blade!
You're going to take somebody's arm off!

932
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,004
Aye, we've got you now!

933
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,489
Fergus: Give me a hand over here!
Put your back into it, Dingwall!

934
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,698
Lord Dingwall:
I'm doing all the pulling here.

935
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,402
Lord macguffin:
Down you go, you scoundrel.

936
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,932
Done!

937
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,857
Yah!

938
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,032
Hah!

939
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:16,879
Get back. That's my mother.
Are you out of your mind, lass?

940
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:19,085
Mum, are you hurt?

941
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:26,676
Merida!

942
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:32,099
I'll not let you kill my mother.

943
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,726
Boys!

944
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,649
Boys?

945
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,946
Mor'du!
Kill it!

946
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,740
You scoundrel!

947
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,205
Come on!
I'll take you with my bare hands!

948
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,285
Mum!

949
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,069
The second sunrise.

950
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,242
No...

951
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:37,989
I don't understand. I...

952
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,970
Oh, mum, I'm sorry.

953
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,174
This is all my fault.

954
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,260
I did this to you.

955
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,262
To us.

956
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,562
You've always been there for me.

957
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,940
You've never given up on me.

958
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,698
I just want you back.

959
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,369
I want you back, mummy.

960
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,140
I love you.

961
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,969
Mum! You're back!

962
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,136
You changed!

963
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,770
Oh, darling,

964
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,856
we both have.

965
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,313
Elinor!

966
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,695
Oh, oh, oh!

967
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,780
Elinor! Ohl

968
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:41,032
ah!

969
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,122
Er... urgh!

970
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,075
Oh, dear.

971
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:49,544
You're back. She came back to us.

972
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,710
It's a great day for this kingdom.
The curse is broke.

973
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,208
Oh! Mum.

974
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:58,883
Eh?
I'm naked.

975
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,215
Naked as a wee babby.

976
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,392
Don't just stare at me. Do something!

977
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:07,309
What the... avert your eyes, lads!

978
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,809
Show some respect!

979
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,196
Now that's what I call
a wee naked babby!

980
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,994
Merida, Elinor, hurry up.
They're leaving.

981
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,242
Mum!
They're off! Come on!

982
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,450
We've got to wave them off!
Come along!

983
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:35,379
Though I may speak
some tongue of old

984
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,841
or even spit out some holy word

985
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:47,145
I have no strength with which to speak

986
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:48,895
oof!

987
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:52,274
When you sit me down
and see I'm weak

988
01:23:56,448 --> 01:24:01,568
goodbye! All the best!
Fair wind to your sails!

989
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:04,950
We will run and scream

990
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:06,947
you will dance with me

991
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,657
but how did this...

992
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,292
Merida: There are those who say fate
is something beyond our command,

993
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,674
that destiny is not our own.

994
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,173
But I know better.

995
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,385
Our fate lives within us.

996
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,894
You only have to be brave enough
fo see it

997
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,859
We will run and scream

998
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:47,117
you will dance with me

999
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:52,451
we'll fulfill our dreams
and we'll be free

1000
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,877
we will be who we are

1001
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:01,381
and then heal our scars

1002
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:06,306
sadness will be far away

1003
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,700
So I had done wrong

1004
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,405
but you put me right

1005
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:34,543
my judgment burned
in the black of night

1006
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:41,543
when I give less than I take

1007
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,926
it is my fault, my own mistake

1008
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:52,310
we will run and scream

1009
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:55,730
you will dance with me

1010
01:25:55,817 --> 01:26:00,777
we'll fulfill our dreams
and we'll be free

1011
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:06,404
we will be who we are

1012
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:09,911
and then heal our scars

1013
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:15,584
sadness will be far away

1014
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,983
Delivery. Sign here, sign here.

1015
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:08,530
Come on, birdbrain. I haven't got all day.

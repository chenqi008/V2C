1
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,926
Some people say
that fairies are the stuff of fantasy.

2
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:56,390
They think the world is just
what you can touch and hear and see,

3
00:00:56,474 --> 00:01:00,186
while others say the tales and legends
cannot be dismissed.

4
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,483
They believe with all their hearts
that fairies truly do exist.

5
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:11,822
Throughout all time,
human beings and fairies never met,

6
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:18,162
till one very special summer
that we shall not soon forget.

7
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:35,596
Life is rising up
Surging forth in all directions

8
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:41,560
Every little buttercup
Is reaching out to find connections

9
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,730
Every blade of grass
Will touch the sunlight

10
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,234
The rain will touch the ground

11
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:53,114
Growing greener than it was before

12
00:01:55,032 --> 00:02:00,788
Bees are droning by
Spider silk is softly spinning

13
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:06,627
Not a cloud in the sky
You know it's only the beginning

14
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:13,425
Every little blossom, every flower
Flings its petals wide

15
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:18,180
As the season comes round
Once more

16
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,309
Hey, Tink! You ready
for your first summer on the mainland?

17
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,563
Absolutely! It's so beautiful out here.

18
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,107
I can't believe we get to stay
for the whole season.

19
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,569
Well, what are we waiting for?
Race you down!

20
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:38,993
The breeze is blowing light and sweet
The grass, a carpet at your feet

21
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:43,372
Catch the colors
Feel the heat of the sun

22
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:51,630
All the sparrows in the dell
Swirling round like a carousel

23
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,634
Singing loud enough to tell everyone

24
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:56,719
Hi, guys.

25
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,554
Summer's just begun

26
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,685
Summer's just begun

27
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,524
There it is, Tink. Fairy camp!

28
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,611
All the winters, all the springs

29
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,780
Lead us here on fairy wings

30
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,035
A season of a thousand things
To be done

31
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,370
Summer's just begun

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,002
Summer's just begun

33
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,381
Hiya, Cheese!

34
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:35,758
Summer's just begun

35
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,552
- Did you have a nice flight?
- Incoming!

36
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:42,097
- Keep her level! Keep her level!
- Gear it down, Bobble!

37
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,602
- Smashing landing, Clanky.
- Thank you, Bobble.

38
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,480
Guys, I think you may
have over-packed.

39
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,608
- Come on, Tink. Let's go inside.
- Inside?

40
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,070
Tink, fairy camp isn't out here
in the open.

41
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,072
We need to stay hidden
from the humans.

42
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,157
- We do?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,826
That's why fairy camp is in here.

44
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:15,422
Cicadas, one at a time.
You, you and you. You, too.

45
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:20,552
Wow. It's like all of Pixie Hollow
under one tree!

46
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,109
Blaze!

47
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,974
Wow! The Queen Anne's lace
is looking beautiful.

48
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,227
- How are the looms working?
- Fine, thanks to you, Tink.

49
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:15,107
Next. Next. Next.

50
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,694
- How's the bee-liner working?
- Like a dream, Tink. Thanks.

51
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,698
- Great. Need any help with that wagon?
- No, thanks. She's running fine.

52
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,658
Okay. Glad to hear it.

53
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,078
Here's the first week's supply.

54
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:32,416
Okay, I'm off. I gotta go deliver
pixie dust to the other fairy camps,

55
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,918
but I'll see you in a couple clays.

56
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,797
And Tink! Don't worry.
You'll find something to fix.

57
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,134
I hope so.

58
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,887
In the meantime,
I need to go find some lost things.

59
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,097
Hold on, little miss spare parts.

60
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,267
You're not going near
the human house, are you?

61
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,396
- There's a human house?
- No! I mean, yes, but no.

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,274
- We stay away from humans.
- Iridessa!

63
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:04,239
- Tinker Bell knows that, don't you?
- Define "stay away. "

64
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,785
- It's gonna be a long summer.
- Grouchy.

65
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:14,249
- That's just Vidia being Vidia.
- No, the air. It smells grouchy.

66
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,711
- We might be in for a storm.
- Come on, Sil.

67
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,883
The sun is shining, the air is warm.
It's a beautiful day. Nothing's gonna...

68
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,475
Tinker Bell.

69
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:29,700
Thank goodness we're here, Father.
It's just like I remember it.

70
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,618
Well, of course, my darling.

71
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,496
Look at the creek and the woods
and the meadow!

72
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,208
I wish it was summer all year long!

73
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,669
Yes, Lizzy.

74
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,987
Tinker Bell, what are you doing here?

75
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,200
Vidia, this is amazing!
It's a carriage that moves by itself!

76
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,494
There's no horse. Seriously, look.

77
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,704
- Do you see a horse up there?
- No.

78
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,875
It's a horseless carriage!
And do you want to know how it works?

79
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,752
- Not really.
- So do I.

80
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,215
I think those wheels back there move
because this chain thing rotates.

81
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,259
And I think what rotates the chain
is this big...

82
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:33,055
I don't care, Tinker Bell. You shouldn't
be this close to the human house.

83
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,932
What if they see us?

84
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,772
Will you stop flitting around in there?
This is serious!

85
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,943
You know what, Vidia?
I think this powers the whole thing!

86
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:54,284
This, my dear, is exactly why tinkers
shouldn't come to the mainland. They...

87
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,412
Let me know if this does anything.

88
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,294
Well, anything? Vidia, you're all wet.

89
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,214
You don't say.

90
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,717
Father, Father, Father! Can we
bring our tea and scones outside

91
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,302
and have them here in the garden?

92
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,972
- It would be just like a little picnic.
- Not just now, Lizzy.

93
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,766
I still have to get the trunk unpacked
and the house settled.

94
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,103
Father, look!
What a magnificent butterfly.

95
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:27,859
My word. Absolutely astonishing.

96
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:31,029
It's so beautiful.
What kind of butterfly is it?

97
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:35,659
Well, judging from the epidermal
membrane, it's clearly an apatura iris,

98
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,162
but the wings
have two entirely different patterns.

99
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,748
Well, that's nearly impossible.

100
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,502
Well, I guess that's just the way
the fairies decided to paint it.

101
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,505
Lizzy, fairies do not paint
butterfly wings

102
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,175
because, as you know,
fairies are not real.

103
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,762
But of course they are.
The proof is right here.

104
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,433
- Their paint dripped all over its wing.
- Really, darling.

105
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,520
Rational people consider
a belief in fairies to be quite foolish.

106
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,106
- The wings are so fresh.
- What are you doing?

107
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,275
Its chrysalis must have been
in the meadow.

108
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,069
The meadow? Father, wait!

109
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,782
That's where I'm going.
Would you like to come?

110
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,035
Not now, Lizzy.
I have to update my field journal.

111
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,746
My interview at the museum
is tomorrow night.

112
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,207
You're going back already?
We just got here.

113
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,713
I know, sweetheart, and I'm very sorry.
But I'll only be gone for the day.

114
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,009
Mrs. Perkins will look after you,
and I'll be back in time to tuck you in.

115
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,511
- Promise?
- I promise.

116
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,307
- Okay.
- That's a good girl.

117
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,694
All clear!

118
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,822
Come on, Vidia.

119
00:10:55,906 --> 00:11:00,369
- I can't fly. My wings are wet.
- That's right. Sorry.

120
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,747
Guess you'll have to walk back.

121
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:09,086
But don't worry, I'll keep you company.
Actually, it might be nice.

122
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,635
Or not.
So, I think I figured out the carriage.

123
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,012
Those bottles of goop
must keep it running smoothly,

124
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,223
like snail slime, you know?

125
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,768
Hate to see the size of the snail
that stuff comes from. And at first...

126
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,309
Here's your house, little fairies.
Wherever you are.

127
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,649
Just needs a little something more.

128
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,614
But I haven't quite figured out
what that sparky wire does.

129
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,326
Hey! Maybe the whole carriage
runs on lightning!

130
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,959
Are those wet wings still bugging you?
Here, Vidia, let me help you.

131
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,256
Tinker Bell, maybe if you spent
less time causing disasters,

132
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,010
you wouldn't have
to help everybody so much.

133
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,349
- The truth hurts, doesn't it?
- Look! We can use these back at camp!

134
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,188
Wow. These'll be perfect for the new
wagon prototype I've been working on.

135
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,107
Here. I bet if I took two or three
and tied them together,

136
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,777
I could make one really strong wheel!

137
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,031
It's a good thing we were walking
or we might never have seen these.

138
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,325
Vidia, where are your buttons?

139
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:07,829
Tinker Bell, I am not carrying
this human junk back to camp.

140
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,715
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

141
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:26,348
Tinker Bell, we're not supposed
to go near human houses.

142
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,142
This isn't a human house.
They're a lot bigger.

143
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,853
Besides, the sign says,
"Fairies welcome. "

144
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,606
Who do you think wrote it? Humans!

145
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,444
Tinker Bell, you're not going in there.

146
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,825
Please tell me you're not going in there!
She went in there.

147
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,084
Wow.

148
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,179
Tinker Bell! Don't eat that!
This could be a trap.

149
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,391
Come on, Vidia. It's perfectly safe.

150
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,892
Really?

151
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,776
- Vidia.
- Not so safe now, is it?

152
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,988
Nice try, Vidia,
but you're not scaring me.

153
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,698
Gosh, this thing is amazing.

154
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,534
You just don't know when to stop,
do you?

155
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,123
Oh, no. Tink! Someone's coming!

156
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,418
The door is stuck!

157
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,545
Come on, Vidia.
You can do better than that.

158
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,964
- Tink!
- I wonder what this part does.

159
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,009
Tink! I'm serious! Get out of there!

160
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,011
Just a second. Just a second.

161
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,232
Vidia? Vidia?

162
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,156
Vidia, come on. Open the door.
You had your little...

163
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,538
Oh, no. What have I done?

164
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,500
Vidia? Okay, not funny anymore.

165
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,675
A fairy!

166
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,182
It's a real fairy!

167
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,773
Father! Father!

168
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,197
Father!

169
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,919
- Father! Father, Father!
- Yes, Lizzy.

170
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,046
You're never going to believe
what I found.

171
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,008
- Maybe later, Lizzy.
- But Father, Father, Father,

172
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,802
- Father, Father.
- Just a moment, dear.

173
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,805
- I'm very busy with my project.
- Yes, but Father!

174
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,390
- Father!
- Lizzy, please.

175
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,227
I must add this extraordinary discovery
to my field journal.

176
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,853
And here it is.

177
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,024
Is that the butterfly
we were looking at earlier?

178
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,819
Yes. Quite a specimen, isn't it?

179
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,071
You're not going to take it to London,
are you?

180
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,949
Yes, of course. The board of trustees
would never believe me

181
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,242
if they didn't see it themselves.

182
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,995
Now I'm sure to get that curatorship
at the museum.

183
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,247
Besides, as a member
of the scientific community,

184
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,334
I'm obligated to share significant
findings like this with my colleagues.

185
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:45,672
I know it's unfortunate for the specimen,
but really, there is no other way.

186
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,924
Now, dear.
What did you want me to see?

187
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,552
Never mind.

188
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,493
Where have you gone?

189
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,970
Mr. Twitches, no! Out! Out with you!

190
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,267
Mr. Twitches!

191
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,275
Bad cat! No, no, no!

192
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,031
Don't worry, little fairy.

193
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,659
Mr. Twitches won't bother you
as long as you're in there.

194
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,246
Naughty cat! You're going outside.

195
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,244
Tinker Bell's
been captured by humans!

196
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,788
- Oh, no.
- What happened? Is she okay?

197
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,123
- Is she all right?
- What's this? Tinker Bell?

198
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,666
- What happened, Vidia?
- Is she hurt?

199
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,295
Tinker Bell went into this little house
in the meadow and couldn't get out.

200
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,172
The door got jammed.

201
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,175
Then this human came from out
of nowhere and snatched her up,

202
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,178
but I know where she is.
We have to hurry and save her.

203
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,597
Then we better leave right away!

204
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,020
Sil, do you think the storm
will pass soon?

205
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,689
No, it looks like it's gonna get stronger.

206
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,858
Well, there's gotta be some way
to get to Tink.

207
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,944
We can't fly in the rain,
and the meadow's already flooded.

208
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,779
Maybe we don't have to fly.

209
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,950
If we get some big leaves and sew them
together with stem twine...

210
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,411
And miter-cut some twigs
for the sub-flooring.

211
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,871
Acorns as counterweights.

212
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,290
Some quick-dry maple sap
as reinforcement.

213
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,875
What are you two talking about?

214
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,086
- We're gonna build a boat!
- We're gonna build a boat!

215
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,933
- More mushroom caps, please!
- Here we go.

216
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,688
This one goes there.
That one goes there. Right?

217
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,983
Righty-o, Bobble.

218
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,416
- Right, more reeds over here.
- This thing had better work.

219
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,754
Give me the sap. You dip it in this way
and give it a big slap like so.

220
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,387
Come on. Come on. Let's get going.

221
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,350
There you go. Now you're talking!

222
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,817
It's working!

223
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,576
Well, this is it.

224
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,456
Hey, faith...

225
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,041
Trust...

226
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,710
- And pixie dust.
- Pixie dust.

227
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,884
Come on. Come on.

228
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,642
Hello.

229
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,483
You don't have to be scared.
I'm very nice.

230
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,864
You're so little.

231
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:07,410
Your dress is very leafy.
Did you make it yourself?

232
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,289
I like your wings.
They're like sparkly lace.

233
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,875
Your hair must be so soft.

234
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:20,673
Are you hungry? Maybe not.
That's okay.

235
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,426
I don't like some kinds of food, either.

236
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,515
I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?

237
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,477
There you go.

238
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:45,281
Wait! Wait! Wait! No, please!
I'm not going to hurt you!

239
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,953
Don't be afraid!
I just want to be your friend!

240
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:57,794
I really won't hurt you. I just love fairies.

241
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,964
I've been drawing fairies
all my life. See?

242
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:07,136
I drew that one when I was three,
but I did that green one last week.

243
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,306
I think it's much better.

244
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,644
I even started to paint
with the watercolors Father gave me.

245
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,273
Is it true that some fairies
paint butterfly wings?

246
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,486
I knew it!

247
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,739
These are some
of my favorite drawings.

248
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,491
This is a water fairy.

249
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,828
- You can tell because her skin is blue.
- Blue?

250
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,248
And here is a candy fairy
living in a lollipop tree.

251
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,291
Do all fairies live in trees
made of sweets?

252
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,172
Really? What about fairy circles?

253
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,010
Well, I hear
that if a person steps in one,

254
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:51,764
a fairy has to grant them three wishes
from their magic bag.

255
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:56,102
But if they don't,
they turn into a pile of delicious sugar,

256
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,895
- and then younger fairies...
- Wait. Wait a minute.

257
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:02,358
- ... must try and turn them back into...
- Where are you getting all this?

258
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:06,237
You jingle when you talk,
like a little bell!

259
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,656
So that's how fairies speak.

260
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,870
So what do you think of my fairies?
And my fairy house!

261
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,208
It got a little shaken up.

262
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:28,009
- Did you make this?
- I don't know what you're saying.

263
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:38,478
Did I make the fairy house? Yes, I did.
Do you like it?

264
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,525
The door's stuck.

265
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,660
Well, you're quite the little tinker,
aren't you?

266
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:58,498
What? Is that your name? Tinker?

267
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,921
Bell? Your name is Bell.

268
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,301
Tinker? Bell?

269
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,806
Tinker Bell? Tinker Bell.

270
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:22,313
What a lovely name!
Well, Tinker Bell, my name's Lizzy.

271
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,695
Do all fairies sound the same
when they talk?

272
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,783
How do you learn to be a fairy?
Do you go to fairy school?

273
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:38,788
Lizzy? Lizzy? Who are you talking to?

274
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,085
My fairy!

275
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:50,591
That's nice, dear. Now, I brought you
something I think you'll really enjoy.

276
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:54,053
These are some
of my old field journals.

277
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,056
Now, I picked out the ones
I thought would excite you the most.

278
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:01,477
This one on rocks and minerals
is particularly interesting.

279
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:06,148
- Is there a field journal about fairies?
- Of course not, Lizzy.

280
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,278
Books like this are based on fact
and scientific research,

281
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:14,073
which is quite the contrary
to your little figurines and drawings.

282
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:18,244
Well, just because you've never seen
a fairy doesn't mean they're not real.

283
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:24,542
Now, Lizzy, seeing is believing,
and without proof, it's just a fairy tale.

284
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:30,214
Now, here is a blank field journal.
Now, you're very talented, my darling,

285
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:35,052
and I'm sure you'll be able to fill it
with your own scientific research.

286
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,512
Yes, Father.

287
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,852
Now if only these leaks
were just pretend.

288
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,356
Tinker Bell, you can come out now.

289
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:56,991
Look, Lizzy, thanks for showing me
your collection, but I really should be...

290
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,661
You want to go?

291
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,457
I really wish you'd stay.

292
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,876
I'm sorry, Lizzy.

293
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,421
Okay, I understand.

294
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,306
So, I guess this is goodbye.

295
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,188
What's wrong?
Can't you fly in the rain?

296
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,818
You can stay with me
until the rain stops.

297
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:36,322
I'll show you around my room.
We can play with my toys.

298
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,324
We'll have so much fun.

299
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,293
- We're past the shallows!
- Aye! Drop the mainsail!

300
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,420
Dropping the mainsail!

301
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,590
- Trim the sail!
- Trimming the sail!

302
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:04,266
- Big thingy, dead ahead! Hard to port!
- Hard to port! Hard to port!

303
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,485
I recognize that wagon.
Stay on this course!

304
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,489
- Aye, Miss Vidia. Will do.
- I sure hope Tink is all right.

305
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:22,201
Who knows what terrible things
could be happening to her right now.

306
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,997
A fairy could get used to this.

307
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:32,002
Isn't it wonderful? Everything in this
house is just your size, Tinker Bell.

308
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,966
That's perfume. It smells like flowers.

309
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,512
My doll. She should be in bed by now.

310
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,849
How old are you? I'm nine.

311
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,646
Do you like my dollhouse?
Do fairies live in houses?

312
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,358
What are fairies' houses made of?

313
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,778
That's a cooker,
but it doesn't actually work.

314
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:01,615
What's your favorite food?
I mean, besides sweets?

315
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,661
I want to know all about real live fairies.

316
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,086
Perfect!

317
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:20,885
"Scientific fairy research. "

318
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,388
Okay. What's your favorite color?

319
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,351
Green is my favorite color, too!

320
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,899
I should start from the beginning.
Where do fairies come from?

321
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,109
I mean, where were you born?

322
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:41,530
Well, that one's
a little more complicated because...

323
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,824
So, a baby, when it laughs
for the first time...

324
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:47,953
A fairy...

325
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,043
Right. One second.

326
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,218
You were a funny-looking baby?

327
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,472
A baby?

328
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,559
Laughs?

329
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:14,980
One?

330
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:18,984
First?

331
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:25,741
When a baby laughs for the first time,
that's when a fairy is born.

332
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,703
Incredible.

333
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,624
Lizzy, that's only the beginning.

334
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,044
Guess I always knew

335
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,048
This could all come true

336
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:45,177
Still it feels so new

337
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,056
Being here with you

338
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,185
Can't believe my eyes

339
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:57,439
A new world comes alive

340
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:01,986
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

341
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,656
We'll live happy ever after

342
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:10,661
We'll shine brighter
Than we thought we'd be

343
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:17,042
Because you showed me
How to believe

344
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,886
More than just pretend

345
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,472
I'll make believe again

346
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,935
I hope this never ends

347
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,772
Maybe we'll be friends

348
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:43,777
Now everything I know
Everything I know

349
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:47,740
I'll never let it go
Never let it go

350
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,911
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

351
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:55,915
We'll live happy ever after

352
00:31:55,998 --> 00:32:00,628
We'll shine brighter
Than we thought we'd be

353
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:07,259
Because you showed me
How to believe

354
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,106
Okay, everybody, listen up.

355
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,944
This road should take us straight
to the human house.

356
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,364
So how far is it from the road
to the house, do you think?

357
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:32,743
Not that far, really.
The only question is, how flooded is it?

358
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,828
That's a good point.

359
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,958
Well, I'm gonna remain optimistic.

360
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,670
- We'll get to Tink in no time.
- I'm with you, Sil.

361
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,131
We're almost there.

362
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,051
Why, look,
we're picking up speed already.

363
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,096
Did you feel that? We're moving faster.

364
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:01,021
Hey, guys!
We're heading right for a waterfall!

365
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,611
Great polliwogs!
We have to make the turn!

366
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,489
Ease the sheets and get ready to jibe!

367
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,491
- What?
- What?

368
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,828
Ease the sheet and get ready to jibe!

369
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,079
- What?
- What did he say?

370
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,916
Loosen the ropes and turn the sail!

371
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,377
- Oh, no!
- Look out!

372
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,881
Man overboard!

373
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,595
Hard to port! Hard to port!

374
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,391
Turn the boat! Turn the boat!

375
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,938
Guys! We're running out of river!

376
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,609
That's all right,
'cause all we need's a little.

377
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,362
- Rosetta, come grab my feet.
- What?

378
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,119
Hang on! We're going straight down!

379
00:33:58,787 --> 00:33:59,830
Oh, no!

380
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,543
Brace yourselves!

381
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,319
- Who's alive?
- Not me.

382
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,907
Me, either. I can't find a pulse!
It's not there!

383
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,368
I'm telling you, I don't... I'm good.

384
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,835
Sorry!

385
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,090
Looks like we're walking from here.

386
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:55,719
- But... Walking where?
- We could be anywhere.

387
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,139
Everything looks the same
from down here.

388
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:02,476
And there's no way of knowing
which way to go.

389
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,187
Clank! Where did you find that?

390
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:10,025
I don't know. Here on the ground.
Is it yours?

391
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,829
I know where we are.

392
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:28,877
Tinker Bell, this is so fascinating.
Thank you.

393
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:33,590
I had no idea fairies were responsible
for changing the seasons.

394
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,802
I thought it had something to do
with the Earth's axis

395
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:41,223
- as it rotated around the sun.
- That's what we wanted you to think.

396
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:47,354
Well, I think we've covered everything.
I hope Father's impressed.

397
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,399
And now, for the finale.

398
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,570
The whole fairy land, Pixie Hollow.

399
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:03,412
It worked!
Tinker Bell, I can't wait to show Father.

400
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:09,918
Tinker Bell? Are you all right?
Tinker Bell?

401
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,590
Sorry. Yeah, let's go show your dad.

402
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,939
Looks like the rain has let up some.

403
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,109
You might be able to make it home
to your friends now.

404
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,866
Maybe this could help you.

405
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,122
Yes.

406
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,712
Such a clever tinker.

407
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,843
Take care of yourself.

408
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,314
I'll never forget you, Tinker Bell.

409
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:20,197
You'd best hurry. The break
in the weather may not last long.

410
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:39,883
Good bye.

411
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:48,642
And I'll never forget you, Lizzy.

412
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,692
- Father, look!
- Not just now, Lizzy.

413
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,777
My hands are rather full at the moment.

414
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,156
I made it especially for you, Father.
It's just like your field journal.

415
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,951
- It's filled with lots of facts.
- Yes, yes, that sounds wonderful,

416
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,745
but I'm in the middle
of a potential catastrophe here.

417
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,122
I can't look at it now.

418
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,500
- But Father, it's a field journal, and I...
- I don't have time.

419
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,128
I have to find some way
to deal with all these leaks

420
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,088
before they destroy my work.

421
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:23,302
- When will you be able to look at it?
- I don't know. Maybe later.

422
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:26,221
You always say that.

423
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:16,980
Tinker Bell!

424
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:23,278
You came back! I'm so glad to see you.

425
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,494
Tinker Bell, Father has no time
for the field journal.

426
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,874
I think I can fix that.

427
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,587
Vidia, you sure you know
where you're going?

428
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,008
Yes. Tinker Bell and I walked by here.
I just have to find the road.

429
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,843
Road? What road?

430
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,597
That road!

431
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,185
That's not a road. That's a muddy river.

432
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,854
So, I guess we need to find a bridge.

433
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:01,400
Or be spontaneous and jump right in.

434
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,486
It's not deep. We can walk across.

435
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,533
Yeah, no. I don't really do mud.

436
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:15,205
- But you're a garden fairy!
- Ironic, isn't it?

437
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:16,540
- Rosetta!
- Rosetta!

438
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,750
Okay, all right. I'm coming.

439
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,633
It's squishy. What was that?

440
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,767
She's stuck!

441
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,520
I can get myself out of here.

442
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,858
All right, all right.

443
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,444
Someone just get me something
to grab onto.

444
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:50,323
- Got it! Clanky, rescue device.
- Right, Bobble. You can count on us!

445
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,661
Okay. Let's give this a try.

446
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,834
Do you feel that?
She's starting to break free.

447
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,544
I don't think so.

448
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,885
- Come on, hurry!
- Pull! Pull!

449
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,054
Pull!

450
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:21,271
Pull!

451
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,330
Hello? Is somebody out there?

452
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:41,791
Anyone?

453
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:48,715
- Grab this! Hurry!
- Are you kidding me?

454
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,092
Trust me. And hold on tight.

455
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,429
Oh, Well.

456
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,610
We got the...

457
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:13,698
- ... rescue device.
- You scared the petals right off of me!

458
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:17,035
Did we miss anything?

459
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:22,958
"My, what a splendid tea service.
I am really quite impressed. "

460
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,046
Then I say,
"Why, thank you, Tinker Bell.

461
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,757
"You are too kind. "

462
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,803
You hold your pinkie out, like this,

463
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:42,602
and that's the way
you throw a proper tea party.

464
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,736
Good night, Lizzy.

465
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,667
There we...

466
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,087
I'm going to bed.

467
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:21,641
There just aren't enough hours
in the day.

468
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:52,083
Good morning, Tinker Bell.
How did you sleep last night?

469
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:56,045
Well, I... Actually, I didn't,
but that doesn't matter.

470
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,840
You should go downstairs
to your father.

471
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,509
- Lizzy?
- Yes, Father?

472
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:05,513
Good morning, my dear.
All the leaks seem to have stopped.

473
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:08,516
I just wanted to make sure
everything is okay in here.

474
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:14,022
Yes. Just fine. No leaks at all. So...

475
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,442
Strange. It's as if
they mended themselves.

476
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,279
It's still raining outside.

477
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,365
I can't imagine how on Earth
such a thing could occur.

478
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,788
Well, there must be an explanation
that I'm just not thinking of.

479
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,290
Well, I'm sure you'll think of it, Father.

480
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,000
- Off we go.
- Perhaps down in your study.

481
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,628
You always do your best thinking there.
I wish you luck.

482
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,590
- Okay, well, play nicely.
- Yes, of course. Bye, Father.

483
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:44,803
That was close.

484
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,680
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

485
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,606
Is that why you fixed those leaks?

486
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,985
So he can spend more time with me?

487
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:06,074
I've really been wanting
to show him this.

488
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,661
Okay, okay. I'll go.

489
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,669
Father, since you have more time,

490
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,046
maybe I can show you
my scientific research.

491
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,966
- The butterfly. It's gone!
- What?

492
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:26,010
The apatura iris
with the irregular wing pattern.

493
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:28,346
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

494
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:32,016
This was my big opportunity,
and now it's gone.

495
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,813
- Elizabeth, did you release it?
- No.

496
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:39,941
Well, I didn't do it.

497
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,360
And since there is no one else
in the house,

498
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:45,071
there is only one logical explanation.

499
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:49,659
- It must have been you.
- I didn't do it, Father.

500
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:54,289
I'm going to give you one more chance.
Tell me the truth.

501
00:47:55,957 --> 00:48:00,837
I could tell you, Father,
but you wouldn't believe me.

502
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:09,929
Very well. Off to your room, young lady.
I'm very disappointed in you.

503
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,813
You know, I was just thinking,
if Tink were here,

504
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,859
- how not quiet it would be right now.
- You can say that again.

505
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,820
Okay, okay, okay. Who am I?

506
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,661
That's the exact shade!

507
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,124
Quite a bit of spirit
in that little tinker, eh?

508
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:42,337
That's for sure. In fact,
I still can't believe she got captured.

509
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,757
Yeah. It's very unlike Tink
to be caught with her guard down.

510
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,135
- I wonder what really happened.
- Well, we'll find out soon.

511
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:53,681
Yep. With every step we take we come
closer and closer to Tinker Bell.

512
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,017
She'll tell us what happened.

513
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,520
Listen, there's something
you all should know.

514
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,691
Tinker Bell getting trapped
is all my fault!

515
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:08,112
I slammed that door on Tinker Bell,
to teach her a lesson.

516
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:10,615
I tried to get her out,
but the door was stuck.

517
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:16,120
I tried, but I couldn't, and now
I've put her and all of us in danger.

518
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,707
I am so sorry.

519
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,713
Honey, this is not your fault.

520
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:29,050
We all know that Tink can get
into plenty of trouble all by herself.

521
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:33,262
It scares me to think what would have
happened if you weren't there, Vidia.

522
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,264
I don't know what to say.

523
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:39,060
- How about faith...
- Trust...

524
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:40,728
- And...
- And...

525
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,814
And pixie dust.

526
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:44,941
- And pixie dust!
- And pixie dust!

527
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,026
Can you reach it, Clanky?

528
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,571
- Almost. Just a little more.
- Here, let me.

529
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,741
Okay. Now, can you see anything?

530
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:57,245
No! There's a big building in the way.

531
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:02,875
Building. It's a house. That's it!
Clanky! We've got it!

532
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:05,211
- What've we got?
- House! Get off.

533
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,547
- I'm sorry.
- I can't feel my legs.

534
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,515
It doesn't matter what I say.
He never believes me.

535
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,269
I'm so sorry, Lizzy.

536
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:26,524
I'm so glad you're here.

537
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,652
You're my best friend.

538
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,288
I wish I were a fairy, just like you.

539
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,043
Then I could help the flowers bloom
and talk to animals

540
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:48,379
and fly around with the other fairies
all the time.

541
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,303
That would be fun.

542
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,941
Where are we going?

543
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,798
What is going on up there?

544
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:31,440
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

545
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:33,359
Now the butterfly is gone.

546
00:52:56,048 --> 00:53:01,012
Oh, my! I'm... I'm flying!

547
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:08,895
Look at me! I'm a fairy!

548
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,740
All clear!

549
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,747
- Sorry.
- Careful.

550
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,040
- That's my ear.
- Sorry.

551
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,499
- Sorry.
- That's the nose. Careful.

552
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,251
- Sorry.
- Can't see!

553
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,255
Okay. Tinker Bell is upstairs.
The little girl has her in a cage.

554
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:37,840
In a cage?

555
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:39,800
And there's also a large human
in the house

556
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:44,472
who doesn't like creatures with wings.
He pins them up in display cases.

557
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,976
- Great. Anything else?
- Yes. The cat.

558
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,811
Cat! What cat?

559
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,147
- That cat!
- That cat!

560
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:00,988
Fawn, you're an animal fairy.
What are we supposed to do?

561
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:04,992
- Fawn?
- Fly!

562
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,495
- Our wings are wet.
- And who knows when they'll be dry.

563
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,413
Okay, okay. Run!

564
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,220
- Clank!
- Come on!

565
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:32,019
- Clank!
- I'm okay.

566
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:36,607
We still need to get to that stairwell.
Any ideas?

567
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,693
If we could just build a bridge
or something.

568
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,696
- That's it. A bridge!
- Guys? Guys?

569
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,240
- A bridge made out of what?
- Guys!

570
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,119
Clank! You're a genius!

571
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,541
It was nothing.

572
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,796
All right. Let's do this.

573
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:12,893
- We need some more plates!
- Okay. Start passing them up, Clanky.

574
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:16,772
Aye, aye! Here they come!

575
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,653
Get ready for more. Hello!

576
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,741
We've got a full plate back here!

577
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:30,536
No, no, no. No. No, please.

578
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:31,954
Get back!

579
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:47,803
Get back!

580
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,973
Rosetta! Is this what I think it is?

581
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:54,643
That is exactly
what you think it is. Catnip!

582
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,813
You get to Tink
and we'll take care of the cat!

583
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:58,898
Got it!

584
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,126
- Lizzy?
- Coming, Father!

585
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,297
- Lizzy?
- Why, hello, Father. May I help you?

586
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:25,716
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing.

587
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,970
Nothing? Sounds like a herd of
elephants have been marching up here.

588
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:35,476
Look at this room.
It looks like a cyclone hit it.

589
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,979
- It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

590
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,441
Your books are all over the floor,
your toys are everywhere

591
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:45,194
and you tore your curtains. What?

592
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:49,115
How did you get footprints
on the ceiling?

593
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,242
This is simply too much.

594
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:54,453
A temper tantrum of this magnitude
is unacceptable.

595
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:56,288
But I wasn't having a tantrum!

596
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:59,583
Then how did this happen?
And the truth this time.

597
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:04,547
If I tell you the truth,
you still won't believe me.

598
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,841
Elizabeth, the truth.

599
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:11,512
I was flying. My fairy showed me how.

600
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:16,016
For goodness sake.
Your make-believe fairy did this?

601
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,352
You've got to stop this nonsense!

602
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,980
But it's not nonsense, Father.
It's the truth!

603
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,149
You have a real fairy
living in your room?

604
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:25,192
Yes! And I can prove it.

605
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:30,781
Just look at the research we did.

606
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,205
Elizabeth. This is what
you've been doing?

607
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,585
Field journals are to be filled with fact,
not fairy tales.

608
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,795
But Father, these are facts!

609
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,966
I don't understand this foolishness,
Lizzy. You have such talent.

610
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:54,138
- Why would you waste it this way?
- Why can't you just believe me?

611
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,098
I believe in what is real,

612
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:59,185
and it's about time
you started doing the same.

613
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:00,728
Father, wait!

614
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:03,939
I know this is difficult for you
to understand,

615
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:06,650
but this is all make-believe.

616
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,987
- No! They're real!
- Elizabeth, this discussion is over.

617
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:12,907
But Father!

618
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,919
It... It...

619
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,590
See? I told you. Fairies are real!

620
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,764
It's okay. She won't hurt you.

621
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,478
It's... Well, it's extraordinary!

622
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,855
Aren't her wings beautiful?

623
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:49,068
Yes. Very similar to Apoidea.
Or, no, no, odonata.

624
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:52,947
Look at the limb proportionality
to the cranial radius.

625
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,491
- Fascinating!
- Isn't she magical?

626
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,036
She's some sort
of evolutionary mutation.

627
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,455
She's not a bug, she's a person.

628
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:02,873
- Exactly!
- Tinker Bell!

629
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:04,875
This is going to be
the discovery of the century!

630
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:06,126
Tink, watch out!

631
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,295
- Vidia?
- Get out of the way!

632
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:14,093
I must get this to the museum
right away!

633
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,553
Father, no!

634
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,347
Please, Father! Wait!

635
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:24,311
- You can't do this!
- Lizzy, I don't have much time.

636
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:27,231
The trustees will only wait for me
until 9:00.

637
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,233
Please, go back in the house.

638
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:32,528
Don't worry.
Mrs. Perkins will be here any second.

639
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,452
Tinker Bell, I'm so sorry!

640
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,747
My father's taking your friend
to the city!

641
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,377
- Step, step, Step-
- Step, step, Step-

642
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,462
- Tinker Bell?
- Tinker Bell!

643
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,631
Look, it's your friends.

644
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:57,386
- Hurry.
- That's it. Good kitty.

645
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:05,227
Look, Lizzy's father trapped Vidia
in a jar while she was saving me.

646
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:08,105
- We have to hurry and rescue her.
- Here we go again!

647
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,941
- How are we gonna get there?
- Yeah, it's still raining.

648
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:15,487
Maybe we can't fly in the rain,
but I think I know someone who can.

649
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,459
I'm scared, Tinker Bell.

650
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:32,963
Floating around my room is one thing,
but flying all the way to London...

651
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:37,760
That easy, huh?

652
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,430
Okay. I'll be brave.

653
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:45,976
All right, fairies.
We need all the pixie dust we can get.

654
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,937
This girl's got a long journey
ahead of her.

655
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,408
All aboard!

656
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,579
Ready?

657
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:08,707
This better work.

658
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,879
Sorry, fairies.

659
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:24,723
Careful now!

660
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,853
Hi, Mrs. Perkins. Bye, Mrs. Perkins.

661
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,815
Bye, dear. Fly back soon.

662
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:03,804
Good idea.

663
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,806
Sorry!

664
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,350
Out of the way!

665
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,230
There he is!

666
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:03,697
Tinker Bell, I can't keep up.
He's going too fast.

667
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:22,174
Tink! Tinker Bell, no!

668
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,862
No, no, no, no, no, no! Come on!

669
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,908
Come on, please, let them still be there.

670
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,752
- Father!
- What in the world?

671
01:04:41,128 --> 01:04:44,798
Father, stop! Don't take her in there!

672
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:50,637
It... it... it... It can't be.

673
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:58,520
Lizzy? You're flying.

674
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,398
Yes, I am.

675
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:06,862
But how? How are you doing that?

676
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,992
My friends showed me how.

677
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,626
I... I don't understand.

678
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,462
You don't have to understand.

679
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:27,132
You just have to believe.

680
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:33,597
I do believe.

681
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,475
I do believe!

682
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:39,144
Father!

683
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:44,149
Lizzy, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

684
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,695
I'll never doubt you again.

685
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:04,211
Vidia!

686
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:12,427
- Let's go home, Father.
- But how?

687
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,643
Think happy thoughts.

688
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:28,610
- Lift your arms and kick your feet!
- Careful!

689
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,243
I think I'm getting the hang of it. Yes!
Why, I'm flying!

690
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:42,916
- You're doing it, Father! You're doing it!
- I could get used to this! Just a second.

691
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:46,545
There's something
I've always wanted to do. Follow me!

692
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:18,577
- Hey, Tink.
- Hey, Vidia.

693
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,496
So, you ever been
to one of these before?

694
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,206
Yeah. It's pretty fun.

695
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:27,044
- What are you supposed to do?
- It's easy. You just pick this up.

696
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:29,671
- Like this?
- Yeah. And then you hold it out.

697
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:32,924
- Got it!
- Now, just raise your pinkie, like this.

698
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:38,013
And then you say, "Excuse me, miss,
but may I have a spot of tea?"

699
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:41,975
Why, certainly, Miss Bell.
A nice, fresh cup.

700
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:47,564
But of course you may have one, too.
This is a tea party, after all.

701
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,691
How about a cup for me, Miss Griffiths?

702
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:51,651
Why, of course, Doctor.

703
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,237
- It's my pleasure, I'm sure.
- Thank you.

704
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:58,283
- And would you like one lump or two?
- Make mine three.

705
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,327
Father!

706
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,166
Thank you.

707
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:12,005
- Isn't this pleasant, Father?
- I can't imagine anything better.

708
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,800
Although, chiming the Big Ben
comes a close second.

709
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,886
- Oh, my goodness.
- Scrumptious.

710
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,524
Don't even think about it.

711
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,370
So, where were we? Yes.

712
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:48,291
"Fairies have many magical talents.
They can talk to animals,

713
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:53,046
"make the flowers bloom,
create warm summer breezes. "

714
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,800
Lizzy, what a beautiful drawing.

715
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:02,764
"And some invent
the most clever little gadgets. "

716
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:06,184
Well, Tink,
you found something to fix after all.

717
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,478
Yeah. I guess I did.

718
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:12,858
"They bring the change of seasons,
and help nature in many ways.

719
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:19,281
"But the best talent a fairy can have
is simply being a friend. "

720
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,035
The breezes blow the clouds away

721
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:27,372
A million things I want to say

722
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:31,751
I don't ever want this day
To be done

723
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,837
Summer's just begun

724
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,464
Never seen the sky so blue

725
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:40,010
Everything is clear and new

726
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:44,556
Happy just to be with you in the sun

727
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,725
Summer's just begun

728
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,786
Hold my hand and fly

729
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,624
Never say goodbye

730
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,794
Cross the open sky

731
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:18,465
Leave the world behind

732
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:22,844
I will be all right

733
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:27,015
If you stay by my side

734
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:31,228
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

735
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:35,148
We'll live happy ever after

736
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:40,070
We'll fly higher
Than we thought we'd be

737
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:43,240
Because you showed me

738
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,951
How to believe

739
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,002
Tiny shining star

740
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,839
I know who you are

741
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:04,010
You're never very far

742
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:07,722
We'll never be apart

743
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:11,977
Sparkle in my eye

744
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:16,398
Light the sky tonight

745
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:20,485
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

746
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:24,531
We'll live happy ever after

747
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:29,035
We'll fly higher
Than we thought we'd be

748
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:32,163
Because you showed me

749
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:36,501
How to believe

750
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:41,506
In me

751
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:07,657
Fall and winter
Love and laughter

752
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:11,494
We'll live happy ever after

753
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:16,499
We'll fly higher
Than we thought we'd be

754
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,669
Because you showed me

755
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:22,422
How to believe

756
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,341
Yeah

757
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:40,482
Hold my hand and fly

758
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:44,986
Never say goodbye

1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,400
Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,648
What is going on inside their head?

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,403
Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head.

4
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,641
Hmm?

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,602
And there she was...

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,081
Hello. Riley.

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,205
Oh, look at you.

8
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,524
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

9
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,763
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

10
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,960
Whoa.

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,723
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.

12
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,482
Er, for 33 seconds?

13
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,410
I'm Sadness.

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,848
Oh, hello. I... I'm Joy. So...

15
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,125
Can I just... If you could...

16
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,765
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

17
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,090
And that was just the beginning.

18
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,487
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

19
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,084
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

20
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,764
Whoa, sharp turn!
No! Look out! No!

21
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
That's Fear.

22
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,048
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

23
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,931
Easy, easy. Ah!

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,889
Oh, we're good. We're good.

25
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,576
Whew! Good job.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

26
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,045
And we're back!

27
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,122
Oh!

28
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,085
Here we go. All right, open.

29
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,056
Hmm. This looks new.
You think it's safe?

30
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,206
What is it?
Aah.

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,085
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

32
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,242
Hold on. What is that?
This is Disgust.

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,800
She basically keeps Riley
from being poisoned.

34
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,201
Physically and socially.

35
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,651
That is not brightly colored

36
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,324
or shaped like a dinosaur.
Hold on, guys.

37
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,800
It's broccoli!

38
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,881
Yucky!

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,290
Well, I just saved our lives.

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,566
Whew!
Yeah. You're welcome.

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,

42
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,485
you're not gonna get any dessert.

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,881
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,126
That's Anger.

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,329
He cares very deeply
about things being fair.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,243
So that's how you
want to play it, old man?

47
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,290
No dessert? Oh, sure,
we'll eat our dinner!

48
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,448
Right after you eat this!

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,281
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

50
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,207
Oh, airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,481
Oh!
Airplane.

52
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,728
And you've met Sadness.
She... Well, she...

53
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,890
I'm not actually sure
what she does.

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,246
And I've checked,

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,696
there's no place for her to go, so...

56
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,200
She's good, we're good. It's all great!

57
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,803
Anyway, these are Riley's memories

58
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,960
and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.

59
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,605
Whoo-hoo!

60
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,001
Whoo-hoo!

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,643
But the really important ones
are over here.

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,480
I don't want to get too technical,

63
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,642
but these are called Core Memories.

64
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,209
Each one came from
a super important time in Riley's life.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,050
Uh, like when she first scored a goal.

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,571
Oh, that was so amazing!

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,291
Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice!

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,040
We got a future center here!
Nice job.

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,766
And each Core Memory

70
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,446
powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.

71
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,809
Like Hockey Island.

72
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,282
Goofball Island is my personal favorite.

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,802
Ah, come back here, you little monkey!

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,889
Oh, you're silly.

75
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,724
Yep, Goofball is the best.

76
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,128
Friendship Island is pretty good too.

77
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,121
Oh, I love Honesty Island.

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,401
And that's the truth!

79
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,922
And of course,
Family Island is amazing.

80
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,607
The point is,
the Islands of Personality

81
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,768
are what make Riley... Riley!

82
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,287
Look out, mermaid!

83
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,610
Lava! Whee!

84
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,289
Who's your friend who likes to play?

85
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,010
Bing Bong, Bing Bong!

86
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,444
Hey! Very nice!
Where'd you learn that?

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,648
Ahhh!

88
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,809
Brain freeze!

89
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,528
Yeah!

90
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,081
Good night, kiddo.

91
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,367
Good night, Dad.

92
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,325
And... we're out!

93
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,640
That's what I'm talking about!

94
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,165
Whoo! Another perfect day!

95
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,441
Nice job, everybody!

96
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,200
Let's get those memories
down to Long Term.

97
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,130
All right, we did not die today!

98
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,009
I call that an unqualified success.

99
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,440
And that's it. We love our girl.

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,443
She's got great friends
and a great house.

101
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,205
Things couldn't be better.

102
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,689
After all, Riley's 11 now.

103
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,521
What could happen?

104
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,281
What...
Aah!

105
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,043
Okay, not what I had in mind.

106
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,769
Hey, look!
The Golden Gate Bridge!

107
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,927
Isn't that great?

108
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,321
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

109
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,216
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

110
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,766
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

111
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,161
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

112
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,605
Uh, yeah...

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,016
Are you kidding?
Get out of the street!

114
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,280
Oh, for Pete's sake! Move it!

115
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,402
These are my kind of people.

116
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,320
All right, just a few more blocks.

117
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,686
We're almost to our new house!

118
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,807
Step on it, Daddy!

119
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,216
Why don't we just live in this smelly car?

120
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,651
We've already been in it forever.

121
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,569
Which, actually, was really lucky,

122
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,296
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

123
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,561
what our new house is going to look like!

124
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,847
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

125
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,090
Ooh! That looks safe!
That one's nice.

126
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,605
Oh, this will be great for Riley!

127
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,926
Oh, no, no, no, no, this one!

128
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,136
Oh, Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

129
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,128
That's the one!
It comes with a dragon.

130
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,480
Now we're getting close,
I can feel it.

131
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,763
Here it is, here's our new house.

132
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,281
And...

133
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,363
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

134
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
We're supposed to live here?
Do we have to?

135
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,976
I'm telling you,
it smells like something died in here.

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,081
Can you die from moving?

137
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,605
Guys, you're overreacting.

138
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,011
Nobody is dying...

139
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,167
A dead mouse!

140
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,096
Great. This is just great.
I'm gonna be sick.

141
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,616
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

142
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,085
Get off of me!

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,486
Hey. All through the drive,

144
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,449
Dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

145
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,567
Let's go check it out!

146
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,776
Let's go!
It's gonna be great!

147
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,801
Yes, yes, yes.

148
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
No, no, no, no, no.

149
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,536
I'm starting
to envy the dead mouse.

150
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,561
Get out the rubber ball,

151
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,971
we're in solitary confinement.

152
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,041
Riley can't live here.

153
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,176
She's right.
It's the worst.

154
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,656
Really bad.
It's absolutely the worst.

155
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

156
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,162
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

158
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,776
Where did you read that?
It doesn't matter.

159
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I read it and it's great.

160
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,921
We'll put the bed there.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,081
And the desk over there.

162
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,321
The hockey lamp goes there.

163
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Uh, put the chair there.

164
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,040
The trophy collection goes there.

165
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,684
Stars! I like that!

166
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,841
Now we're talking!

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,680
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van!

168
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,565
All right. Goodbye.

169
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,681
Well, guess what?

170
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,480
The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

171
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,965
You're kidding.
Mmm-hmm.

172
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,327
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

173
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
That figures. The van is lost.

174
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,576
You said it would be here yesterday!

175
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,976
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,160
Mom and Dad are stressed out!

177
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,056
They're stressed out?
What are we going to do?

178
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,560
I've got a great idea!

179
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,250
Did you even read the contract?

180
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,887
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

181
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,961
Hey!

182
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,041
Oh, no, you're not!

183
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,256
She's lining up for the shot!

184
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,281
Coming behind you.

185
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,216
Watch out! Watch out!
She shoots and she scores!

186
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,810
Yeah!

187
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,962
Come on, Grandma!
Ha!

188
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Grandma?

189
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,004
Uh-oh, she put her hair up,
we're in for it!

190
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,606
Whoo!

191
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,529
Hey, put me down!

192
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,564
Ah! Sorry.

193
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,687
Hold on. Hold on.

194
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,562
Hello?
Wait. Wh...

195
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,846
You're kidding.

196
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,285
All right. Stall for me.

197
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,401
I'll be right there.

198
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,416
The investor's supposed
to show up on Thursday,

199
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,601
not today!

200
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,131
I got to go.

201
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,605
It's okay. We get it.

202
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,926
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

203
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
See you, sweetie.

204
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,320
Dad just left us.

205
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,004
He doesn't love us anymore.

206
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,241
That's sad.

207
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,890
I should drive, right?

208
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,447
Joy?

209
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,286
What are you doing?

210
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,970
Uh, just give me one second.

211
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,089
Um, you know what I've realized?

212
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,561
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

213
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,606
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

214
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,761
Maybe we could try that?

215
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,205
Pizza sounds delicious.

216
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,850
Pizza? That's good.
Yes! Pizza!

217
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,760
What the heck is that?
Who puts broccoli on pizza?

218
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,921
That's it. I'm done.

219
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,122
Congratulations, San Francisco,

220
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,406
you've ruined pizza!

221
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,686
First the Hawaiians

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,001
and now you!

223
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,447
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

224
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,883
Must be
a San Francisco thing, huh?

225
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,250
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.

226
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,288
At that diner in Nebraska.
Oh, yeah.

227
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,761
The spoon stood up in the soup by itself!

228
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
That was disgusting.

229
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,650
Oh, good. Family is running.

230
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,080
Dad's got a steel stomach.

231
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,804
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?

232
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
What was your favorite part?

233
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,645
Spitting out the car window!

234
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

235
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,281
Wearing a seat belt!

236
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,120
Oh! What about the time
with the dinosaur?

237
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,120
Oh, that's the one.
Definitely!

238
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,641
Say cheese!

239
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,250
Dad! Dad!
Honey!

240
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,640
Now hold still.
The car!

241
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,929
Stop! No, no, no!

242
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,961
Nice one, Joy.

243
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,610
I liked that time at the dinosaur.

244
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,284
That was pretty funny.

245
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,085
Wait. What? What happened?

246
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,320
She did something to the memory.

247
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,727
What did you do?
I just touched it.

248
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,776
That shouldn't make it change.
Change it back, Joy!

249
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,136
I'm trying.
You can't change it back?

250
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,049
No! I guess I can't!
Good going, Sadness.

251
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,856
Now when Riley thinks
of that moment with Dad,

252
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,120
she's gonna feel sad.

253
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,805
Bravo.
I'm sorry, Joy.

254
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,120
I don't really know...

255
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,685
I thought maybe if you...

256
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,363
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

257
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,096
Just don't touch any other memories

258
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
until we figure out what's going on.

259
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,727
Okay.
All right.

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,048
Get ready. This is a monster railing

261
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,083
and we are riding it all the way down!

262
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
Wait, what? What happened?

263
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
A Core Memory!

264
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,561
Oh, no!

265
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,846
Sadness, what are you doing?

266
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,016
It looked like one was crooked

267
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,929
so I opened it and then it fell out.

268
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,041
I...

269
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,241
Whoo-hoo!

270
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,724
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

271
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,211
Joy!
Whoa, whoa!

272
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,562
Sadness, you nearly
touched a Core Memory.

273
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,001
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

274
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,241
I know. I'm sorry.

275
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,084
Something's wrong with me.

276
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,089
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

277
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,248
You're not having
a breakdown. It's stress.

278
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,011
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

279
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,242
No, you're not.
And annoying.

280
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,289
You know what?

281
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,289
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

282
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,084
There's always a way to
turn things around,

283
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,605
to find the fun.

284
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,484
Yeah. Find the fun.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
I don't know how to do that.

286
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,731
Okay. Well,

287
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,290
try to think of something funny.

288
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,641
Um... Oh!

289
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,445
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

290
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,483
Oh. Yeah, that's not...

291
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,284
What about that time with Meg

292
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,283
when Riley laughed so hard

293
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,408
milk came out of her nose?

294
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,280
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

295
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,964
Ooh, it was awful.

296
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,776
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

297
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,484
Uh, what are your favorite things to do?

298
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,806
My favorite?

299
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,287
Um... Well, I like it when we're outside.

300
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,290
That's good. Like there's
the beach and sunshine.

301
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,765
Oh! Like that time

302
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,524
we buried Dad
in the sand up to his neck.

303
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,847
I was thinking more like rain.

304
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,484
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

305
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,403
We can stomp around in puddles.

306
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,643
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

307
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,762
More like when
the rain runs down our back

308
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,330
and makes our shoes soggy.

309
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,690
And we get all cold, shivery, and

310
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,610
everything just starts
feeling droopy.

311
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,808
Oh, hey, hey. Hey, easy.

312
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
Why are you crying?

313
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,005
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

314
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,648
Crying helps me slow down and obsess

315
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,882
over the weight of life's problems.

316
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,521
You know what? Let's, uh,

317
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,966
think about something else.

318
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,805
How about we read
some mind manuals, huh?

319
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,042
Sounds fun.
I've read most of them.

320
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,136
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

321
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,243
Long Term Memory Retrieval,
Volume 47?

322
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,567
No.
Ooh, a real page-turner!

323
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,763
Long Term Memory data selection

324
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,524
via channel subgrouping?

325
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,046
See? Fun already! Oh, you lucky dog.

326
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,531
You're reading these cool things.

327
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,841
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

328
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,889
What can we do?
We've only got capital

329
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,450
to last a month, maybe two.

330
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,536
If we can't find investors by then,

331
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,080
we're going to have to lay people off.

332
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,209
Mom! Dad!

333
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,645
Come kiss me good night!

334
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,120
I know. I know.
Be right there!

335
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,889
We've got to land this, okay?

336
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,722
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

337
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,964
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

338
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,565
There are no bears in San Francisco.

339
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,688
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

340
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,087
Oh, I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot.

341
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,536
Ew! I don't want to
hear about your nerves.

342
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,370
I'll tell you what it is.
This move has been a bust.

343
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,960
That's what I've been
telling you guys!

344
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,496
There are at least 37 things for
Riley to be scared of right now.

345
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,170
The smell alone is
enough to make her gag.

346
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,163
I can't believe
Mom and Dad moved us here!

347
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,527
Look, I get it. You guys have concerns.

348
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,920
But we've been through worse!

349
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,896
Tell you what,
let's make a list of all the things

350
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,570
Riley should be happy about.

351
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,611
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

352
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,696
Pizza is weird here.
Our friends are back home.

353
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,440
And all of our stuff is in the missing van!

354
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,210
Oh, come on. It could be worse.

355
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,210
Yeah, Joy. We could be
lying on the dirty floor. In a bag.

356
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,883
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.

357
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,536
But think of all the good things that...

358
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,881
No, Joy. There's
absolutely no reason for Riley

359
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,166
to be happy right now.

360
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,447
Let us handle this.

361
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,681
I say we skip school tomorrow

362
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,976
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

363
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,776
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

364
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,450
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

365
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,251
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

366
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,970
It's a good one!
Now hold on!

367
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,129
Look, we all have our off days.

368
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,282
You know...
Hi, honey.

369
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,045
The Mom bad news train is pulling in.

370
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,161
Toot-toot!

371
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,164
Still no moving van.

372
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,056
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

373
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,127
Toot-toot-toot!

374
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,969
Where's Dad?
On the phone.

375
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,369
This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

376
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,970
I rest my case!

377
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,730
Oh, your dad's a little stressed,

378
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,896
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

379
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,366
Now for a few
well-placed withering scowls.

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,288
I guess all I really
want to say is, thank you.

381
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,846
Huh?
You know,

382
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,930
through all this confusion
you've stayed...

383
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,162
Well,
you've stayed our happy girl.

384
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,080
Your dad's
under a lot of pressure,

385
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,927
but if you and I can keep smiling,

386
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,331
it would be a big help.

387
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,008
We can do that for him. Right?

388
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,281
Whoa.

389
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,401
Well.

390
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,166
Yeah, sure.

391
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,405
What did we do to deserve you?

392
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,200
Sweet dreams.
Good night.

393
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,763
Well, you can't argue with Mom.
Happy it is.

394
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,171
Team Happy! Sounds great!

395
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,361
Totally behind you, Joy.

396
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,769
Looks like we're going into REM.

397
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,285
I got Dream Duty, so I'll take care

398
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,771
of sending these to Long Term.

399
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,490
Great day today, guys!

400
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,640
Oh, sleep well, Team Happy!

401
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,368
All right,
what's on tonight, Dream Production?

402
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,049
Well, this is it. The new place.

403
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,007
Come live with me, Riley.

404
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,409
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

405
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,005
Eat me!
I'm organic!

406
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,842
No! Who is in charge
of programming down there?

407
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,048
I know I'm not supposed to do this, but...

408
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,249
We are not going to
end the day like this.

409
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,486
Don't you worry.

410
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,441
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

411
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,451
I promise.

412
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,845
Hello! Did I wake you?

413
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,167
Do you have to play that?
Well, I have to practice.

414
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,965
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

415
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,562
Okay, first day of school!

416
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,641
Very, very exciting.

417
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,842
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

418
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,325
Here it is! Fear.

419
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,845
I need a list of all the possible

420
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,008
negative outcomes
on the first day at a new school.

421
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,296
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell meteor?

422
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,322
Disgust. Make sure
Riley stands out today.

423
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,646
But also blends in.

424
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,643
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

425
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

426
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,961
Joy. Yes, Joy?

427
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,496
You'll be in charge of the console,

428
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,931
keeping Riley happy all day long.

429
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,736
And may I add I love
your dress? It's adorable.

430
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,256
Oh, this old thing? Thank you so much.

431
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,406
I love the way it twirls.

432
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,086
Train of Thought! Right on schedule.

433
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,250
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

434
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,647
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

435
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,776
It might come in handy.
If this new school is full of

436
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,644
boring, useless classes.
Which it probably will be.

437
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,361
Oh. Sadness. I have
a super important job just for you.

438
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,324
Really?
Mmm-hmm. Follow me.

439
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,126
What are you doing?
And there. Perfect!

440
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,243
This is the circle of Sadness.

441
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,169
Your job is to make sure that

442
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,686
all the Sadness stays inside of it.

443
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,651
So you want me to just stand here?

444
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,530
Hey, it's not my place to
tell you how to do your job.

445
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,048
Just make sure that all the Sadness

446
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,366
stays in the circle!

447
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,649
See? You're a pro at this! Isn't this fun?

448
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,801
No.
Atta girl.

449
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,176
All right, everyone, fresh start.

450
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,416
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

451
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,616
which will turn into a good year,

452
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,800
which turns into a good life!

453
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,083
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

454
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,407
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

455
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,090
How do I look? Do you like my shirt?

456
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,531
Very cute!

457
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,536
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

458
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,006
Mom and Dad? With us in public?
No thank you.

459
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,201
Uh... I'm on it!

460
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,442
Nope! I'm fine. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

461
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,000
Have a good day at school, monkey.

462
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,930
Have a great day, sweetheart!

463
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,120
That's crazy. It really is.

464
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,240
That was so funny.

465
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Do you know
what basketball game is coming up?

466
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,176
Are you sure we want to do this?

467
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,170
In we go!
Okay! Going in! Yes!

468
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,767
Did you see her? Hello!

469
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,776
Okay, we've got
a group of cool girls at two o'clock.

470
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,216
How do you know?
Double ears pierced,

471
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,287
infinity scarf.

472
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,686
Whoa. Is she
wearing eye shadow?

473
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,816
Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
Let's go talk to them!

474
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,604
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

475
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
We want them to like us.

476
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,371
Oh. Yeah. Wait, what?

477
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,289
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

478
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,607
Worst scenario is either quicksand,

479
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,091
spontaneous combustion,

480
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,850
or getting called on by the teacher.

481
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,296
So as long as none of those happen...

482
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,891
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

483
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,042
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?

484
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,167
This is not happening!

485
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,125
Riley, would you like
to tell us something about yourself?

486
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,328
No! Pretend we can't speak English.

487
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,646
Don't worry. I got this.

488
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,250
Uh... Okay.

489
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,364
My name is Riley Andersen.

490
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,649
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

491
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,201
And how about Minnesota?

492
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,656
Can you tell us something about it?

493
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,921
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

494
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,890
She's hilarious!

495
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,085
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

496
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,161
The lake freezes over,

497
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,645
and that's when we play hockey.

498
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,848
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie Dogs.

499
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,726
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

500
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,642
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

501
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,331
It's kind of a family tradition.

502
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,204
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

503
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,965
Or we did, till I moved away.

504
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,320
Hey, what gives?
Wait, what?

505
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,042
Hey, Sadness! You touched
a memory? We talked about this.

506
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,889
Oh, yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

507
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,049
Get back in your circle.
What's going on?

508
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,080
Why won't it eject?
Get it out of there, Joy.

509
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,567
We used to play tag and stuff.

510
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,200
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

511
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,536
Did you see that look?
Oh, no.

512
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,561
They're judging us!

513
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,367
Somebody help me!
Grab that... Everybody put...

514
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,848
But everything's different now.

515
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,727
Since we moved.

516
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,688
Oh, no! We're crying! At school!

517
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,127
What? Sadness! What are you doing?

518
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,401
Oh, no! Oh, I'm sorry!

519
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,807
Huh?

520
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,689
It's a Core Memory!

521
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,291
But it's blue.

522
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,522
No! Wait! Stop it! No! Ah! No!

523
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,806
Joy, no.

524
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,411
That's a Core Memory!
Hey!

525
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,726
Joy, wait!
Stop it! Let go!

526
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,050
Ah! The Core Memories!

527
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,121
No, no, no, no!

528
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,642
Whoa!
Whoa!

529
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,771
Thank you, Riley.

530
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,321
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

531
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,204
but we're happy to have you here.

532
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,002
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

533
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,650
and turn to chapter seven.

534
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,964
Can I say that curse word now?

535
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,802
Ah!

536
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,323
Oh, no! One, two, three. Okay.

537
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,803
I got them. Where are we?

538
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,201
Long Term Memory? Wait...

539
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,325
Goofball Island?

540
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,568
Riley's Islands of Personality.

541
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,165
They're all down!

542
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,843
Oh! This is bad.

543
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,002
We... We can fix this!

544
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,404
We just have to
get back to Headquarters,

545
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,005
plug the Core Memories in,

546
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,764
and Riley will be back to normal.

547
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,161
Riley has no Core Memories.

548
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,322
No Personality Islands and no...

549
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,641
What? What is it?

550
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,841
You.

551
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,764
You're not in Headquarters.

552
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,531
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

553
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,804
We got to get you back up there.

554
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,806
I'm coming, Riley.

555
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,202
So, as it turns out, the green trash can

556
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,282
is not recycling, it's for greens.

557
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,964
Like compost. And eggshells.
Mmm.

558
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,684
And the blue one is recycling.

559
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,776
And the black one is trash.
Riley is acting so weird.

560
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,880
Why is she acting so weird?

561
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,207
What do you expect?
All the Islands are down.

562
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,367
Joy would know what to do.

563
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,641
That's it.

564
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,445
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

565
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,285
Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust,

566
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,891
how are we supposed to be happy?

567
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,402
Hey, Riley. I've got good news!

568
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,404
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

569
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,448
And get this: Try-outs are tomorrow

570
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,449
after school. What luck, right?

571
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,891
Hockey?
Uh-oh. What do we do?

572
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,485
Guys, this is...

573
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,726
You pretend to be Joy.

574
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,729
Won't it be great to be
back out on the ice?

575
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,961
Oh, yeah, that sounds fantastic.

576
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,729
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

577
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,082
Uh, because I'm not Joy.
Yeah, no kidding.

578
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,640
Did you guys pick up on that?

579
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,489
Mmm-hmm. Something's wrong.
Totally.

580
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,800
Should we ask her?

581
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,604
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,

582
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,767
so she doesn't notice.

583
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,048
So, how was the first day of school?

584
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,327
She's probing us.

585
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,731
I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

586
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,167
What? Okay. Um, hmm.

587
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,604
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

588
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,405
Oh. Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

589
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,563
Something is definitely going on.

590
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,041
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

591
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,736
We're going to
find out what's happening.

592
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,046
But we'll need support.

593
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,121
Signal the husband.

594
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,167
Ahem!

595
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,882
With a nice pass over to Reeves,

596
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,281
comes across ...and nice!

597
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,402
Uh-oh. She's looking at us.
Uh, what did she say?

598
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,801
What? Oh! Sorry, sir.
No one was listening.

599
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,202
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

600
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,089
What? What is it, woman? What?

601
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,322
Ugh, he's making that stupid face again.

602
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,244
I could strangle him right now.

603
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,527
Signal him again.

604
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,931
Ah! So, Riley, how was school?

605
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,923
You got to be kidding me!
Seriously?

606
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,884
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

607
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,845
Move! I'll be Joy.

608
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,044
School was great, all right?

609
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,203
Riley. Is everything okay?

610
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,481
Ugh!

611
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,330
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

612
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,886
What is her deal?

613
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,684
All right, make a show of force.

614
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,376
I don't want to have to
put the foot down.

615
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,323
No, not the foot!

616
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,568
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

617
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,404
Oh, I'll show you attitude, old man.

618
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,845
No. No, no, no! Stay happy!

619
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,728
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

620
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,569
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

621
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,530
Take it to DEFCON Two.

622
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,688
You heard that, gentlemen.
DEFCON Two.

623
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,480
Listen, young lady, I don't know where

624
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,522
this disrespectful attitude came from...

625
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,085
You want a piece of this, pops?

626
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,366
Come and get it!

627
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,005
Yeah, well... Well...

628
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,368
Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

629
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,371
Keys to safety position.

630
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,800
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

631
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,085
Just shut up!

632
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,366
Fire!

633
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,407
That's it! Go to your room! Now!

634
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,521
Uh!

635
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,566
The foot is down! The foot is down!

636
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,684
Good job, gentlemen.

637
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,285
That could have been a disaster.

638
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,565
Well, that was a disaster.

639
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,850
Come fly with me, gatinha.

640
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,686
We're going to walk out there? On that?

641
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,730
It's the quickest way back.

642
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,729
But it's right over the Memory Dump.

643
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,082
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

644
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,121
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

645
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,651
Oh, okay.
It's not that high.

646
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,683
It's totally fine...

647
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,201
No!

648
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,001
Hey.

649
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,924
So, uh, things got a little
out of hand downstairs.

650
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,291
Do you want to talk about it?

651
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,047
Come on, where's my happy girl?

652
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,609
Monkey.

653
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,883
Oh, he's trying to start up Goofball.

654
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,961
Come on!

655
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,641
Ah!

656
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,125
Go back! Run, run, run!

657
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,401
What...

658
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,691
I get it. You need some alone time.

659
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,846
We'll talk later.

660
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,125
We have a major problem.

661
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,123
Oh, Joy, where are you?

662
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,568
We lost Goofball Island.

663
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,725
That means she can lose Friendship

664
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,042
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

665
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,924
You can fix this, right, Joy?

666
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,365
I, uh... I don't know.

667
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,164
Oh...
But we have to try.

668
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,441
Okay, come on.

669
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,729
Riley's gone to sleep.
Oh...

670
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,320
Which is a good thing.

671
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,720
When you think about it because

672
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,848
nothing else bad
can happen while she's asleep.

673
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,008
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

674
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,567
We'll just go across Friendship Island.

675
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,371
Oh, we'll never make it.

676
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,521
Oh, no!
No, no, no!

677
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,296
Don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

678
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,209
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

679
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,840
Oh, Sadness,
we don't have time for this.

680
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,123
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

681
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,927
Wait, Joy,
you could get lost in there!

682
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,571
Think positive!

683
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,122
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

684
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,444
That's Long Term Memory.

685
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,122
An endless warren
of corridors and shelves.

686
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,810
I read about it in the manuals.

687
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,370
The manuals?

688
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,607
The manuals!

689
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,529
You read the manuals!
Yeah.

690
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,568
So you know
the way back to Headquarters!

691
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,081
I guess.

692
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,009
Ooh!

693
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,081
You are my map!

694
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,601
Let's go! Lead on, my map!

695
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,761
Show me where we're going!

696
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,606
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

697
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,411
Just give me a few... hours.

698
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,687
Ooh!

699
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,487
Which way? Left?

700
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,721
Right.

701
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,406
No. I mean, go left.

702
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,323
I said left was right. Like correct.

703
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,566
Okay.

704
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,689
This actually
feels kind of nice.

705
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,644
Okay, here we go!

706
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,802
We'll be back to Headquarters
before morning.

707
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,367
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

708
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,291
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

709
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,970
Yeah, just another right.

710
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,209
And... a left and then another...
left and...

711
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,926
Uh, are you sure
you know where we're going?

712
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,731
Because we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

713
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,649
Riley's awake.

714
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,121
Ooh! Oh!

715
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,045
Don't touch. Remember?

716
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,640
If you touch them, they stay sad.

717
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,122
Oh, sorry, I won't. Starting now.

718
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,447
Oh, I can't take much more of this.

719
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,886
Forget them!

720
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,161
Mind workers!

721
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,406
But, Joy, we're almost...

722
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,001
Phone numbers.

723
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,776
We don't need all these.
They're in her phone.

724
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,240
Excuse me, hi.
Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

725
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,016
I need to find Friendship Island.
Look at this.

726
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,690
Four years of piano lessons.

727
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,920
Yeah, it looks pretty faded.

728
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,371
You know what'? Save Chopsticks

729
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,080
and Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest.

730
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,016
Are you...
US Presidents. What do you think?

731
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,080
Yeah, just keep
Washington, Lincoln and the fat one.

732
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,361
Forget 'em!
Hey!

733
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,606
You can't throw those away!

734
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,976
Those are perfectly good memories.

735
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,287
The names of
every Cutie Pie Princess doll?

736
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,124
Yes! That is critical information!

737
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,486
Glitterstorm, Honeypants...

738
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,607
Forget 'em!

739
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,881
Hey! Bring those back!

740
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,080
They're in the dump. Nothing
comes back from the dump.

741
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,736
Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

742
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,888
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

743
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,605
Fades?
Happens to the best of them.

744
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,242
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

745
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,760
TripleDent gum
WOMAN: Will make you smile

746
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,205
The song
from the gum commercial?

747
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,416
You know, sometimes we send that one

748
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,536
up to Headquarters for no reason.

749
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,040
It just plays in Riley's head
over and over again.

750
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,610
Like a million times!

751
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,006
Let's watch it again!

752
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,281
TripleDent gum

753
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,249
Yeah, I know. We all know the song.

754
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,725
Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay.

755
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,856
Hey, what do you think?
Should we do it?

756
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,881
Yeah!

757
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,570
Okay, here we go!

758
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,921
TripleDent gum

759
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,365
What the... This again?

760
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,087
Wait! Do you know how to
get to Friendship Island?

761
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,567
TripleDent gum

762
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Do you like it there?
Did you feel any earthquakes?

763
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,761
Is the bridge cool?

764
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,240
Yeah, it's good.

765
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,616
What happened with the playoffs?

766
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,687
We won the first game.

767
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,960
Coach says we might actually
go to the finals this year.

768
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,736
Oh, and we've got
this new girl on the team.

769
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,886
She's so cool.

770
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,604
Uh, she did not just say that.

771
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,921
A new girl? Meg has
a new friend already?

772
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,088
Hey, hey! Stay happy!

773
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
We do not want to lose
any more islands here, guys!

774
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,576
We can pass
the puck to each other

775
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,967
without even looking.
It's like mind reading!

776
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,486
You like to read minds, Meg?

777
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,329
I got something
for you to read, right here!

778
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,000
Let's just be calm for one second! Ahhh!

779
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,376
I heard they have parrots...
I've got to go.

780
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,731
What?
I got to go!

781
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Okay, could you just please
tell me which way is...

782
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,321
Oh, no!

783
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,324
Friendship Island! What?

784
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,324
Oh, not Friendship.

785
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,724
Oh, Riley loved that one.
And now it's gone.

786
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,566
Goodbye, friendship.

787
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,165
Hello, loneliness.

788
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,961
We'll just have to go the long way.

789
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,008
Yeah. The long, long, long, long way.

790
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,321
I'm ready.

791
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,690
There's got to be a better way.

792
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,690
Ooh! Look at you!

793
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,761
Huh?

794
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,401
I will take you, but not you.

795
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,682
Oh, who am I kidding? I can't leave you.

796
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,770
Hello!

797
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,121
Wait! Hey! Wait!

798
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,681
Oh, wait! Stop!

799
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,766
Excuse me.
Ah!

800
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,410
Uh, I was looking for, um... Diversion!

801
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,363
What?
Ha-ha! So long, sucker!

802
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,120
Ow, I hurt all over.

803
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,730
Wait. I know you.

804
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,689
No, you don't. I get that a lot.

805
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,416
I look like a lot of people.

806
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,090
No, no, no. I do.

807
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,771
Bing Bong! Riley's imaginary friend!

808
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,326
You really do know me?
Well, of course!

809
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,881
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

810
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,485
Oh! Oh, you would know.

811
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,856
We're trying to get
back to Headquarters.

812
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,882
Headquarters? You guys
are from Headquarters?

813
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,611
Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness.

814
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,769
You're Joy? The Joy?
Mmm-hmm.

815
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,405
What the heck are you doing out here?

816
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,696
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

817
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,724
Wow. Without you,
Riley won't ever be happy.

818
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,127
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

819
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,571
I'll tell you what. Follow me!

820
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,085
Oh, thank you!

821
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,970
It is so great to see you again.

822
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,242
I gotta tell you, I am such
a huge fan of your work.

823
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,767
Do you remember when you
and Riley were in a band?

824
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,411
I went to all of your concerts.

825
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,766
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

826
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,410
Watching you play tag
was such a treat.

827
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,925
Two-time world champ.

828
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,530
Oh! And remember your rockets?

829
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,688
Of course!
It runs on song power!

830
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,445
That's right! Your theme song!

831
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,896
Who's your friend who likes to play?

832
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,126
Bing Bong Bing Bong

833
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,680
His rocket makes you yell Hooray!

834
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,046
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

835
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,881
What exactly are you supposed to be?

836
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,531
You know, it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy.

837
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,288
But shape-wise I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

838
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,686
Dolphin?

839
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,096
You got to remember,
when Riley was three,

840
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,485
animals were all the rage.

841
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,284
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

842
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,016
That's all people talked about back then.

843
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,451
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true.

844
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,696
What are you doing out here?

845
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,122
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends lately.

846
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,607
So, uh, I, you know, um...

847
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,608
Hey, hey. Don't be sad.

848
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,968
Tell you what. When I get
back up to Headquarters,

849
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,809
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

850
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,451
You will?
Of course!

851
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,602
She'd love that.

852
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,887
This is the greatest day of my life!

853
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,689
Ha, cha, cha, cha, cha. Ow!

854
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,882
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

855
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,166
Oh, are you okay?

856
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,726
Hey, what's going on?

857
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,490
I cry candy.

858
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,085
Try the caramel. It's delicious.

859
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,491
Ooh. Whoa!

860
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,644
Ooh, here, use this.

861
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,320
Thanks!
Whoa, hold on, wait a second.

862
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,804
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

863
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,324
Here. What? It's imaginary.

864
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,529
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier

865
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,776
to walk back to Headquarters.

866
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,325
Walk? We're not walking.

867
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,648
We're taking the Train of Thought!

868
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,124
The train, of course!

869
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,806
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

870
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,564
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

871
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,360
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

872
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,601
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

873
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,122
Oh, I am so glad we ran into you!

874
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,251
The station is right
through here. After you.

875
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,606
Joy.
What?

876
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,404
I read about this place

877
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,124
in the manual. We shouldn't go in there.

878
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,296
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

879
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,368
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

880
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,560
What are you talking about?

881
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,411
I go in here all the time.
It's a shortcut, you see?

882
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,207
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

883
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,204
Look at me. I'm closer to the station

884
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,204
because I'm taking the shortcut.

885
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,569
Let's go around. This way.

886
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,250
Almost there!

887
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,687
If you want to walk the
long way, go for it.

888
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,728
But Riley needs to be happy.

889
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,291
I'm not missing that train.

890
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,760
Bing Bong knows what he's doing.

891
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,769
He's part dolphin.
They're very smart.

892
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,570
Well, I guess.

893
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,363
What did you get?
I don't know.

894
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,084
Okay, what abstract concept

895
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,536
are we trying to comprehend today?

896
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,210
Um... Loneliness.

897
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,443
Hmm. Looks like
there's something in there.

898
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,776
I'm going to turn it on for a minute

899
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,926
and burn out the gunk.

900
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,731
What did I tell you?
You'll be at Headquarters in no time.

901
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,006
Whoa!

902
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,600
Say, would you look at that?

903
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,529
Whoa! What's happening?

904
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,920
Oh, no, they turned it on.

905
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,082
Huh. Never seen this before.

906
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,163
My face! My beautiful face! Oh!

907
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,000
What is going on?
We're abstracting!

908
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,208
There are four stages. This is the first:

909
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,009
Non-objective Fragmentation!

910
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,167
All right. Do not panic.

911
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,363
What is important is that
we all stay together. Oh!

912
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,936
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

913
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,042
Run! Ah!

914
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,250
I can't feel my legs!

915
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,001
Oh, there they are.

916
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,281
Come here, me!

917
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,605
We've got to get out of here

918
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,330
before we're nothing
but shape and color!

919
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,602
Ow! We'll get stuck here forever!

920
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,490
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

921
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,801
I told you, it's a shortcut!

922
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,048
The train!

923
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,088
Oh, no. We're
two-dimensional! That's stage three!

924
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,161
We're getting nowhere!

925
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,841
Depth! I'm lacking depth!
Come on.

926
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,726
We can't fit.

927
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,083
Oh, no, we're Nonfigurative.

928
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,730
This is the last stage!

929
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,360
We're not going to make it!

930
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,763
Wait! We're
two-dimensional. Fall on your face!

931
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,684
Stop! Stop!

932
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,250
Oh, no! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

933
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,204
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

934
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,376
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

935
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,600
How long until the next train?

936
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,802
Who knows. But don't worry.

937
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,370
There's another station. That way.

938
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,885
The train always stops there.

939
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,530
Right before it goes to Headquarters.

940
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,409
If we hurry, we can catch it.

941
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,768
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

942
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,689
Yeah!

943
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,926
Is there really another station?

944
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,326
Uh-huh. Through there.

945
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,167
Welcome to Imagination Land!

946
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Imagination Land?

947
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,607
Sure!

948
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,961
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

949
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,845
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French Fry Forest!

950
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,803
Mmm! Delicious.
No way!

951
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,008
Check it out!
Trophy Town!

952
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,050
Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!

953
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,200
I won first place!

954
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,409
Me too!
Oh, participation award.

955
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,451
Wait, is that... Sadness,
look, it's Cloud Town!

956
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,244
That is my favorite!

957
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,482
Oh, it's so soft!

958
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,125
Oh! Let me try.

959
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,129
Hey! What's the big idea?

960
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,686
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

961
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,924
Oh, no! Lava! Whoo! Oh!

962
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,889
Imagination Land is the best!

963
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,848
Oh, is it all going to be so interactive?

964
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,242
Hey, look! The House of Cards!

965
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,970
Oh, wait. Hang on just a minute.

966
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,243
Your rocket!
Yeah.

967
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,044
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

968
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,566
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

969
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,165
Oh, I'm sorry.
Great.

970
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,688
Oh, I love Imagination Land.

971
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,127
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

972
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,480
Who the heck is that?

973
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,721
Imaginary boyfriend.

974
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,490
I would die for Riley.

975
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,840
Oh, I've never seen him before.

976
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,120
I live in Canada.

977
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,967
Anyway, this way.
Through Preschool World!

978
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,280
We're nearly to the train!

979
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,600
Riley, here we come! Whoo-hoo!

980
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,683
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

981
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,366
These kids look pretty good,

982
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,120
considering they're from San Francisco.

983
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,520
Okay, Andersen, you're up!

984
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,085
Got to go.
Okay.

985
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,440
Good luck, sweetie!

986
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,776
Luck isn't going to help us now.

987
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,656
If she tries to use Hockey Island,
it's going down.

988
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,330
Which is why I've recalled

989
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,044
every hockey memory I can think of.

990
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,481
One of these has got to work

991
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,005
in place of the Core Memory.

992
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,411
She's about to play!
Hurry!

993
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,450
Ha-ha! We did it, gang! It's working!

994
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,801
Oh!

995
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,450
Line change! Line change!

996
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,409
Change it up!

997
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,283
No! No! Aah!

998
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,165
It's like
we don't learn anything.

999
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,328
Come on!
Let's pick it up out there!

1000
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,050
Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it!

1001
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,167
Oh!

1002
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,891
That's it!
No, no, no! Breathe.

1003
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,525
Find your happy place.

1004
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,888
What's her problem?

1005
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,369
Riley. What's wrong?
Let's go.

1006
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,960
You're not going to finish tryouts?

1007
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,286
What's the point?
Hey.

1008
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,482
It'll be all right. Let's just go back...

1009
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,449
Stop saying everything will be all right!

1010
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,284
Nice hustle, ladies!

1011
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,287
Hockey?

1012
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,604
Oh, no, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

1013
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,007
Hey! Look at that!

1014
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,326
Very nice shot!
Hey!

1015
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,084
Bing Bong, we have to
get to that station.

1016
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,207
Sure thing. This way,

1017
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,930
just past Graham Cracker Castle. Hey.

1018
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,281
That's weird.

1019
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,896
Graham Cracker Castle
used to be right here.

1020
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,207
I wonder why
they moved it? Wow, that's not...

1021
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,761
I would have sworn
Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here.

1022
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,576
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

1023
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,881
We'll have to come back.
Princess Dream World!

1024
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,731
Oh, no! The stuffed
Animal Hall of Fame!

1025
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,766
My rocket!

1026
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,602
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

1027
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,246
It still has some song power left!

1028
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,960
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1029
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,966
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

1030
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,530
Riley and I are going to the moon!

1031
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,121
Oh!

1032
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,402
Riley can't be done with me.

1033
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,082
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

1034
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,084
We just need to
get back to Headquarters.

1035
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,480
Which way to the train station?

1036
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,961
I had a whole trip planned for us.

1037
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,606
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?

1038
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,802
Here comes the tickle monster!

1039
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,800
Hey, Bing Bong! Look at this!

1040
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,127
Oh! Here's a fun game!

1041
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,211
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

1042
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,529
Won't that be fun? Come on,
let's go to the train station!

1043
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,129
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

1044
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,009
They took something that you loved.

1045
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,530
It's gone. Forever.

1046
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,848
Sadness. Don't make him feel worse.

1047
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,921
Sorry.

1048
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,690
It's all I had left of Riley.

1049
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,926
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

1050
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,248
Oh, they were wonderful.

1051
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,004
Once we flew back in time.

1052
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,924
We had breakfast twice that day.

1053
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,281
Sadness...

1054
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,727
It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

1055
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,762
Oh, she did.
We were best friends.

1056
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,689
Yeah. It's sad.

1057
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,521
Wh...

1058
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,521
I'm okay now.

1059
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,124
Come on. The train station is this way.

1060
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,881
How did you do that?

1061
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,088
Oh, I don't know. He was sad.

1062
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,441
So I listened to what...

1063
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,369
Hey! There's the train!

1064
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,081
Oh! We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

1065
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,642
Oh, no! These Facts and Opinions
look so similar.

1066
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,922
Oh, don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

1067
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,801
On a scale of one to ten,

1068
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,365
I give this day an F.

1069
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,250
Well, why don't we quit standing
around and do something?

1070
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,407
Like what, genius?

1071
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,369
Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

1072
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,409
Sure it's the coward's way out.

1073
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,528
But this coward's gonna survive.

1074
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,721
Ow!

1075
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,045
Emotions can't quit, genius!

1076
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,931
Ugh! I thought we were supposed to
be keeping Riley happy.

1077
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,085
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1078
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,406
Mmm.

1079
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,443
Aha!

1080
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,280
What is it?
Oh, nothing.

1081
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,642
Just the best idea ever.
What?

1082
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,286
All the good Core Memories

1083
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,606
were made in Minnesota.

1084
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,769
Ergo, we go back to Minnesota
and make more.

1085
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,920
Ta-da!
Wait, wait, wait.

1086
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,844
You're saying we run away?

1087
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,406
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

1088
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,960
I'd call it the Happy Core
Memory Development program.

1089
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,366
You can't be serious.

1090
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,766
Hey! Our life was perfect

1091
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,281
until Mom and Dad decided to move to

1092
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,850
San Fran Stinktown.

1093
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,162
I mean, it's just so drastic!

1094
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,448
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

1095
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,290
Our room? Our back yard?

1096
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,361
Our friends?

1097
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,730
TripleDent gum
WOMAN: Will make you smile

1098
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,121
Did I ask for the gum commercial?

1099
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,720
Anyway, it was better, that's my point.

1100
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,286
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

1101
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,720
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

1102
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,325
Fine. Let's sleep on it.

1103
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,324
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun-filled times

1104
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,329
are just around the corner.

1105
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,847
Huh?

1106
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,330
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

1107
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,687
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

1108
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,690
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

1109
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,696
Yeah, the Train of Thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

1110
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,006
Oh, we can't wait that long.

1111
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,205
How about we wake her up?
Sadness, that's ridiculous!

1112
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,930
How could we possibly...

1113
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,920
How about we wake her up?

1114
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,923
Great idea, Joy.
Thanks. Come on!

1115
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,361
Whoa! This place is huge!

1116
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,126
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

1117
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,164
Wow! I Can Fly?

1118
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,924
I love that one!

1119
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,407
Rainbow Unicorn!
She's right there!

1120
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,449
My friend says you're famous.

1121
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,561
She wants your autograph.

1122
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,251
No, no, Sadness,
don't bother Miss Unicorn, okay?

1123
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,686
Sorry, she's from out of town.

1124
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,046
That was so embarrassing, right?

1125
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,762
I loved you in
Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7.

1126
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,921
Okay, bye. I love you!

1127
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,530
Huh. Wonder what that means.

1128
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,840
Oh, well, let's go in.

1129
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,770
Set up the classroom set!

1130
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,006
Today's memories are in!

1131
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,809
We've got
a lot to work with here.

1132
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,251
Riley dumped her best friend,

1133
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,805
had a miserable day at school,

1134
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,921
and quit hockey.

1135
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,240
The writers have
put together a killer script!

1136
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,244
Just because Joy
and Sadness are gone,

1137
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,890
I have to do stupid Dream Duty.

1138
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,683
Okay. How are we going to wake her up?

1139
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,604
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

1140
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,324
We could scare her.
Scare her?

1141
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,124
No, she's been through enough already.

1142
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,776
But, Joy...
Sadness, you may know your way

1143
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,609
around down here, but I know Riley.

1144
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,966
We're gonna make her so happy,

1145
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,208
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

1146
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,606
We'll excite her awake!

1147
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,529
That's never happened before.

1148
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,523
Ooh!
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

1149
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,681
I don't think that'll work.

1150
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,000
Bing Bong?
Yeah?

1151
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,641
Don't let anything happen to these.

1152
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,881
Got it.

1153
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,811
Mmm-hmm. Add the reality
distortion filter.

1154
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,725
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

1155
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,131
Riley is the camera!

1156
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,402
Makeup,
get out of there, we are on in five,

1157
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,806
four, three...

1158
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,566
Hello, class.

1159
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,563
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

1160
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,369
Man, she is one bad actress.

1161
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,209
Which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

1162
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,050
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

1163
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,170
Would you like to stand up

1164
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,645
and introduce yourself?
Camera.

1165
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,244
And cue Riley.

1166
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,010
My name is Riley Andersen.

1167
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,924
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

1168
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,444
Ew, look! Her teeth are falling out!

1169
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,576
That's disgusting.
Ew, gross!

1170
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,761
Teeth falling out.

1171
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,126
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

1172
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,051
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

1173
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,401
Hey, look!
She came to school with no pants on!

1174
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,522
Called it!
Ready?

1175
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,688
I don't think
this happy thing is going to work.

1176
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,847
But if we scare her...

1177
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,450
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

1178
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,849
Bark! Bark! Bark!

1179
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,687
Who is that?
Uh, what's going on?

1180
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,525
Psst! You're on! Go!

1181
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,129
Whoo! Let's party!

1182
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,850
Let's dance! Whoo!

1183
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,201
Hey, a party.

1184
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,841
Bark, bark, bark!

1185
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,843
Joy, this isn't working.

1186
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,647
Huh!

1187
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,684
Huh? Sadness, what are you doing?

1188
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,081
Come back here!

1189
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,881
It's just a dream,
it's just a dream. It's just a dream.

1190
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,200
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

1191
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,805
Hi, Riley, it's me!

1192
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,496
Who's your friend
Bing Bong?

1193
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,856
Who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong! a'

1194
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,530
Sadness, stop! It was working!

1195
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,601
Ow.

1196
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,561
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

1197
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,641
But look, it's working!

1198
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,001
Whoa.

1199
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,809
They are not
part of this dream. Get them!

1200
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,244
Stop right there!
Ow!

1201
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,767
Pan away! Pan away!

1202
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,208
Boo! Pick a plotline!

1203
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,049
Ow! Careful!
Hold still!

1204
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,406
You can't do this!

1205
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,363
I know people in Headquarters!

1206
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,650
Ow! Cut that out!
Ow! Please!

1207
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,770
Do you like candy? You look hungry.

1208
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,922
I get you candy! Oh no!

1209
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,769
No, no. No, no!

1210
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,848
There go the Core Memories!

1211
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,763
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark!

1212
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,966
Please!

1213
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,281
Oh, come on.

1214
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,601
What is this place?

1215
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,926
The Subconscious.

1216
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,002
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1217
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,241
My hat feels loose.

1218
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,481
Mmm. How do we get in?

1219
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,687
Let me see.

1220
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,560
You got my hat?
Or is that your hat?

1221
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,041
Yeah, it's my hat.

1222
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,168
You sure? I don't know,
look in the label.

1223
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,481
Yeah, it says, My hat.
Wait, it says, My hat?

1224
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,416
My hat, it says.
That's what I wrote in my hat.

1225
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,776
What are you talking about?
You've got my hat on.

1226
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,560
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1227
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,882
Hey! You!
Oh! You caught us!

1228
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,320
Get back in there!

1229
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,890
No escaping!

1230
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,321
I don't like it here.

1231
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,289
It's where they keep
Riley's darkest fears.

1232
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,125
It's broccoli.

1233
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,360
The stairs to the basement!

1234
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,485
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

1235
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,366
Okay, come on.

1236
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,247
Would you walk quieter?

1237
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,361
I'm trying.

1238
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
What is going...

1239
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,042
Candy wrappers?

1240
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,043
Bing Bong!
Joy?

1241
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,362
There you are.
Shhh!

1242
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,731
It's Jangles.

1243
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,080
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

1244
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,440
Do you have the Core Memories?

1245
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,926
Yeah.

1246
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,082
All he cared about was the candy!

1247
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,327
Shh.

1248
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,161
We're out of here! Let's get to that train!

1249
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,047
Wait! The train's not running.

1250
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,849
We still have to wake up Riley.

1251
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,041
But how?

1252
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,286
Oh, no!

1253
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,366
Hey, Sadness.

1254
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,808
Did you hear
about the pa-pa-party they were having?

1255
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,609
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, Joy.

1256
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,326
Isn't it a birthday party?

1257
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,721
Did you say

1258
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,484
birthday?

1259
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,563
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

1260
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,801
And games and balloons...

1261
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,285
A birthday?

1262
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,090
Okay. Follow us!

1263
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,160
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1264
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,640
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1265
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,360
No it isn't. That's my... I wrote that.

1266
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,760
No, but this one's my handwriting.

1267
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,007
Who's the birthday girl?

1268
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,330
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, let's go!

1269
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,208
Ha-ha! We made it!

1270
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,168
Guess who's on their way
to Headquarters!

1271
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,521
We are!

1272
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,370
Whoo-hoo! JOY: Whoo!

1273
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,040
What is going on?
He did it again!

1274
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,601
We were at school, and we were
naked, and there was a dog,

1275
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,002
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw Bing Bong!

1276
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,162
You idiot! It was a dream!

1277
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,366
This is ridiculous!

1278
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,363
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

1279
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,520
Time to take action.

1280
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,289
Stupid Mom and Dad.
If they hadn't moved us,

1281
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,691
none of this would've happened.

1282
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,247
Who's with me?

1283
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,005
Um...

1284
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,526
No no no no no.

1285
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,411
Yeah. Let's do it.

1286
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,129
She took it. There's no turning back.

1287
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,046
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

1288
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,167
Well, why don't we go down

1289
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,129
to the elephant lot and rent an elephant?

1290
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,526
Hey. That sounds nice.

1291
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,091
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1292
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,123
There's a bus
leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

1293
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,328
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

1294
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,728
Mom's purse.
You wouldn't.

1295
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,565
Oh, but I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1296
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,401
TripleDent gum No!

1297
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,602
It's downstairs somewhere.

1298
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,410
Mom and Dad got us into this mess.

1299
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,085
They can pay to get us out.

1300
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,169
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?

1301
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,123
You can see everything from up here.

1302
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,322
Look, there's Inductive Reasoning.

1303
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,521
There's Déjà Vu.

1304
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,931
There's Language Processing.

1305
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,366
There's Déjà Vu.

1306
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,681
There's Critical Thinking.

1307
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,000
There's Déjà Vu.

1308
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,805
Hey, look at this, guys! Memories!

1309
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,408
Hey. That was a good idea.

1310
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,729
About scaring Riley awake.

1311
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,201
You're not so bad.

1312
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,601
Really?

1313
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,281
Nice work.

1314
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,647
Oh, I can't wait
to get the old Riley back.

1315
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,961
As soon as we get there,

1316
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,445
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1317
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,121
Whoa. Is this Riley?

1318
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,007
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1319
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,451
How are we gonna get to the moon?

1320
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,131
Oh, it's that time
in the twisty tree, remember?

1321
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,005
The hockey team showed up

1322
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,122
and Mom and Dad were there cheering.

1323
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,881
Look at her,
having fun and laughing.

1324
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,165
Oh, I love this one.

1325
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,488
Hmm. I love that one, too.

1326
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,088
Atta girl! Now you're getting it!

1327
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,481
Yeah. It was the day the Prairie Dogs

1328
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,324
lost the big playoff game.

1329
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,129
Riley missed the winning shot.

1330
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,328
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

1331
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,766
Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?

1332
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,003
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

1333
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,887
Okay.

1334
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,240
But I just don't understand.

1335
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,002
Why did our moving van
even go to Texas?

1336
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,200
Multiple customers?

1337
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,647
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

1338
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,681
Uh-huh.

1339
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,044
Excuse me,
isn't there any way that you can rush it?

1340
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,561
Honesty Island?

1341
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,881
Look out!

1342
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,641
Come on!

1343
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,084
Hold on!

1344
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,205
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!

1345
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,084
Come on, people!
Let's, go, go, go!

1346
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,566
That was our way home.

1347
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,680
We lost another island?
What is happening?

1348
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,485
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

1349
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,241
What?

1350
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,444
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

1351
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,560
Are we really doing this?

1352
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,445
I mean, this is serious.
Look.

1353
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,607
We have no Core Memories.

1354
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,285
You want Riley to be happy?

1355
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,442
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1356
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,560
Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her.

1357
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,685
Family Island. Let's go!

1358
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,360
Joy! Joy!

1359
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,606
It's too dangerous!

1360
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,600
We won't make it in time.

1361
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,131
But that's our only way back!

1362
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,086
A recall tube!

1363
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,290
We can get recalled!

1364
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,649
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1365
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,929
See you after school, monkey.

1366
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,047
We love you!

1367
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,761
Go! Run, run! Go!

1368
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,045
Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop!

1369
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,441
You're hurting Riley!

1370
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,363
Oh, no, no, no! I did it again!

1371
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,961
If you get in here,

1372
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,242
these Core Memories will get sad.

1373
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,044
I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy.

1374
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,521
Joy?

1375
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,245
Joy!

1376
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,721
Joy!

1377
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,367
Joy?

1378
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,441
Joy!

1379
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,322
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

1380
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,084
Don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

1381
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,121
We're forgotten.

1382
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,841
We used to play tag and stuff.

1383
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,088
But everything's different now.

1384
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,846
Since we moved.

1385
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,924
Do you remember how she used to

1386
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,480
stick her tongue out
when she was coloring?

1387
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,409
I could listen to her stories all day.

1388
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,726
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

1389
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,286
And now...

1390
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,770
It was the day the Prairie Dogs

1391
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,609
lost the big playoff game.

1392
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,450
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1393
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,771
She wanted to quit.

1394
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,007
Sadness.

1395
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,729
Mom and Dad... The team...

1396
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,641
They came to help because of Sadness.

1397
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,291
We have to get back up there.

1398
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,289
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1399
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,528
We might as well be on another planet.

1400
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,726
Another planet.

1401
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,002
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1402
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,207
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1403
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,810
His rocket makes you yell Hooray!

1404
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,650
Who's the best in every way

1405
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,160
And wants to sing this song to say?

1406
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,844
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1407
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,365
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1408
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,960
His rocket makes you yell Hooray!

1409
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,121
Hop in.

1410
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,176
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1411
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,361
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1412
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,696
His rocket makes you yell Hooray!

1413
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,801
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1414
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,961
Who's the best in every way

1415
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,480
And wants to sing this song to say

1416
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,576
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1417
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,800
Bing Bong, Bing Bong
His rocket makes you yell Hooray!

1418
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,881
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1419
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,080
Who's the best in every way

1420
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,640
And wants to sing the song to say...

1421
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,727
Come on!

1422
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,216
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1423
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,287
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1424
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,256
His rocket makes you yell Hooray!
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1425
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,496
Who's the best in every way
And wants to sing this song to say

1426
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,120
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1427
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,245
Ow!

1428
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,200
Come on, Joy.
One more time.

1429
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,490
I got a feeling about this one.

1430
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,921
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1431
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,136
His rocket makes you yell Hooray!
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1432
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,336
Who's the best in every way
And wants to sing this song to say

1433
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,576
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1434
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,251
Louder! Joy, sing louder!

1435
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,521
To sing this song to say

1436
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,520
Who's your friend who likes to...

1437
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,376
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1438
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,216
His rocket makes you yell Hooray!
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1439
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,376
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1440
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,606
Bing Bong

1441
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,006
We're gonna make it!

1442
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,366
Whoo-hoo! Bing Bong! We did it!

1443
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,969
We... Bing Bong? Bing Bong!

1444
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,285
You made it!

1445
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,802
Go! Go save Riley!

1446
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,124
Take her to the moon for me. Okay?

1447
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,282
I'll try, Bing Bong.

1448
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,326
I promise.

1449
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,521
We're home!

1450
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,245
Riley? Riley!

1451
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,841
I'll call her cell.

1452
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,841
Oh, this is terrible.

1453
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,016
Wait, is that someone
walking towards us?

1454
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,201
Yep, let's cross the street.

1455
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,450
It's Mom. She's onto us!

1456
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,776
What do we do?
Where's my bag?

1457
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,450
Riley needs to get Core Memories.

1458
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,204
That's the stuff.
We keep going.

1459
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,401
Sadness!

1460
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,804
Sadness! Sadness?

1461
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,211
Come on, Sadness.
Where are you? Okay.

1462
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,328
If I were Sadness, where would I be?

1463
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,601
Oh. Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

1464
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,083
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1465
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,804
Oh, no! It's Mom again! What do we do?

1466
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,841
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

1467
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,922
Let's get this idea
out of her head.

1468
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,401
Sadness?

1469
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,763
Sadness!

1470
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,761
Joy?

1471
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,965
Wait! Sadness!

1472
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,251
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

1473
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,440
Come back!

1474
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,285
Okay, you're saying your husband

1475
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,084
was blown away by an elephant.

1476
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,327
Was he with anyone?

1477
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,680
Yes! And there she is!

1478
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,291
Hey! Come back here!

1479
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,488
Forget it, Jake. It's Cloud Town.

1480
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,966
Oh! What? Sadness!

1481
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,004
I only make everything worse!

1482
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,282
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

1483
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,204
It's stuck!
Oh, great.

1484
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,004
What do you mean it's stuck?
Now what?

1485
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,322
Oh, no no no no! What is this?

1486
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,765
How do we stop it?
I got it!

1487
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,936
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

1488
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,724
Brilliant!
I know it's brilliant! Do it!

1489
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,922
Ah! Nothing's working!
Why isn't it working?

1490
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,296
Let me try.
Great! You broke it!

1491
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,456
No, I didn't! Don't touch that!

1492
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,400
Let me do it! Get out of here!

1493
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,570
Guys, we can't make Riley feel anything.

1494
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,685
What have we done?

1495
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,085
Hey! Hey, look at me!

1496
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,571
Did you mean what you said before?

1497
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,921
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1498
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,724
Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it.

1499
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,409
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1500
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,000
I would die for Riley!

1501
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,524
That's it! I fold!

1502
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,241
Whoa!

1503
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,169
Whoa.

1504
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,601
Whoa!

1505
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,245
Whoa!

1506
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,405
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

1507
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,769
I am positive this is crazy!

1508
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,926
Now!
For Riley!

1509
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,364
Joy?
Hang on!

1510
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,888
Oh, I wish Joy was here!

1511
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,281
It's Joy!

1512
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,286
Stand back!

1513
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,521
That worked.

1514
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,802
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

1515
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,965
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

1516
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,805
What?
Of course your tiny brain is confused.

1517
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,400
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

1518
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,808
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you,

1519
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,888
but let me try. Duh!

1520
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:48,966
Oh, thank goodness you're back!

1521
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,096
Things are really messed up!
We found this idea.

1522
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,088
We were just trying to
make happy memories.

1523
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,416
Joy, you got to fix this! Get up there!

1524
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,124
Sadness, it's up to you.

1525
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,089
Me?
Sadness?

1526
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,681
I can't, Joy.

1527
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,406
Yes, you can. Riley needs you.

1528
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,606
Okay.

1529
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,766
Wait! Stop! I want to get off!

1530
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,204
All right. Thank you. We will.

1531
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,567
Her teacher hasn't even
seen Riley all day.

1532
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,856
What?
What was she wearing last?

1533
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,000
Do you even remember what...
I can't believe this.

1534
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,336
Riley, there you are!
Thank goodness!

1535
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,486
We were worried sick!

1536
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,005
Where have you been? It's so late!

1537
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,128
Oh, honey!
What happened? Are you all right?

1538
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,163
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

1539
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,651
we talked to your teacher.

1540
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,563
I know you don't want me to but...

1541
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,091
I miss home.

1542
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,650
I miss Minnesota.

1543
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,209
You need me to be happy, but...

1544
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,569
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

1545
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,490
I want to go home.

1546
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,970
Please don't be mad.

1547
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,530
Oh, sweetie.

1548
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,886
We're not mad.

1549
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,087
You know what? I miss Minnesota too.

1550
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,526
I miss the woods where we took hikes.

1551
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,686
And the backyard
where you used to play.

1552
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,410
Spring Lake,
where you learned to skate.

1553
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,681
Come here.

1554
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,810
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1555
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,400
Friendship Island has expanded.

1556
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,920
Glad they finally opened
that Friendly Argument section.

1557
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,208
I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

1558
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,931
Fashion Island? Oh. Everyone shut up.

1559
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,162
Boy Band Island?
Hope that's just a phase.

1560
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,170
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1561
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,640
All right. Here you go.

1562
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,530
Your new expanded console
is up and runnin'.

1563
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,005
Ooh!
Wow!

1564
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,491
Cool! Upgrade!
Ooh!

1565
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,681
Hey! Whoa-ho!

1566
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,120
Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?

1567
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,521
Hey. Guys? What's pub-er-ty?

1568
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,602
I don't know. It's probably not important.

1569
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:36,651
Whoa. I have access to
the entire curse word library!

1570
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,325
This new console is the...

1571
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,525
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

1572
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,800
They're getting to the rink.

1573
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,336
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

1574
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,124
I know, Dad.
But not too aggressive.

1575
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,726
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

1576
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,809
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!

1577
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,881
Go Foghorns!

1578
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,923
Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!

1579
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,809
Okay! I got to go!

1580
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,800
Aw!
They love us.

1581
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,530
Yeah, Mom and Dad are pretty cool.

1582
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,046
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1583
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,725
She loved the face painting!

1584
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,365
Ha! Told you it was a great idea!

1585
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,084
Best idea he's had in a while.

1586
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,690
He's a really good guy.

1587
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,521
Just in case.

1588
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:21,841
Oh!

1589
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,441
Sorry.

1590
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,007
Girl! Girl! Girl!

1591
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,404
Uh... Okay. Bye.

1592
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,011
Remember, just hustle.

1593
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,451
Go, Riley!

1594
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,480
You got this!

1595
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,164
You ready?
Yeah.

1596
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,607
All right. Let's play some hockey!

1597
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,802
All right, Anger, take it!

1598
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,136
Give us that puck
or you're dead meat!

1599
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,161
On our left. On our left!

1600
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,896
Let's just try not
to get all smelly this time.

1601
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,287
Oh. Mom and Dad
are watching us fail.

1602
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,481
Not for long!

1603
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,200
We've been through
a lot lately, that's for sure.

1604
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,969
But we still love our girl.

1605
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,890
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1606
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,246
Things couldn't be better.

1607
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,400
After all, Riley's twelve now.
What could happen?

1608
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,563
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1609
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,603
Anyone? Jordan?

1610
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,609
Uh...

1611
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,570
How much more of this?

1612
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,722
Five months, two weeks and four days

1613
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,325
until summer vacation.

1614
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,523
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

1615
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,771
Come fly with me, gatinha.

1616
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,290
Have a nice day.

1617
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,441
What are we mad about?

1618
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,529
I don't know.
Whatever Troy's mad about.

1619
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,961
What's Troy mad about?

1620
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,406
I don't know.

1621
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,445
I know. Totally.

1622
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,646
We're a total fraud!

1623
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,136
Do you think they can see through us?

1624
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,049
Of course not!
We're wearing eye shadow!

1625
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,889
Being cool is so exhausting.

1626
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:22,084
Who's the birthday girl?
Huh? Hey! Hello?

1627
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:27,121
Six years of drama school for this?

1628
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,526
Move it, will you?

1629
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,330
What are you doing? Come on!

1630
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,204
You know what?
This is okay. This is fine.

1631
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,402
We just need to go to our happy place.

1632
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,567
TripleDent gum

1633
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,409
No! Not this again!

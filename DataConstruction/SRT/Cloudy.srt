When you shot it into

it up there in the first place.

with microwave radiation,

into any kind of food you want.

I wore a ponytail,
I had glasses,

made fun of again.

Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's
something you should see.

825
00:43:36,092 --> 00:43:37,354
What?

826
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,696
This is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week.

827
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:46,725
And this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today.

828
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:48,900
The machine uses
microwave radiation

829
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:51,266
to mutate the genetic
recipe of the food.

830
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:54,102
The more we ask it to make,
the more clouds it takes in,

831
00:43:54,277 --> 00:43:58,270
the more radiation it emits, the more
these molecules could over-mutate.

832
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:01,716
I think that's why the
food is getting bigger.

833
00:44:02,752 --> 00:44:04,549
Here's what I heard: "Blah, blah, blah."

841
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:27,636

of one family member

I've always felt that you
were like a son to me, Flint.

00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:45,493
And I'm gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon,

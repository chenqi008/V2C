1
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,430
Sometimes,
I think I'm cursed.

2
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,070
Because of something that
happened before I was even born.

3
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,420
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.

4
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,440
The papa, he was a musician.

5
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,290
He and his family would sing and
dance and count their blessings.

6
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,080
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.

7
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,460
And one day,

8
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,460
he left with his guitar
and never returned.

9
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,470
And the mama...

10
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,140
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.

11
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,580
After banishing all music from
her life she found a way...

12
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,200
to provide for her daughter.

13
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,490
She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.

14
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,930
She could have made candy,

15
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,030
or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear...

16
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,350
for wrestlers,
but no, she chose shoes.

17
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,220
Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.

18
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,190
And later,
she taught her son-in-law.

19
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,180
Then her grandkids
got roped in.

20
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,840
As her family grew,
so did the business.

21
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,110
Music had torn
her family apart.

22
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,240
But shoes held
them all together.

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,560
You see, that woman was

24
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,110
my great-great-grandmother,
Mama Imelda.

25
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,940
She died
way before I was born.

26
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,110
But my family
still tells her story

27
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,680
every year
on Dia de los Muertos...

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,180
the Day of the Dead.

29
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,080
And her little girl,

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,530
she's my great-grandmother,
Mama Coco.

31
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,120
Hola, Mama Coco.

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,650
How are you, Julio?

33
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,820
Actually, my name is Miguel.

34
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,660
Mama Coco has trouble
remembering things.

35
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,690
But it's good
to talk to her anyway.

36
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,830
So, I tell her
pretty much everything.

37
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,570
I used to run like this.

38
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,570
But now I run like this
which is way faster.

39
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,740
And the winner
is Luchadora Coco!

40
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,870
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,840
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

42
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,080
Miguel, eat your food.

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,710
My abuelita,
she's Mama Coco's daughter.

44
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,850
Oh, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.

45
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,990
No, gracias.

46
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,220
I asked if you would
like more tamales!

47
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,590
Si?

48
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,160
That's what
I thought you said!

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,730
Abuelita runs our house

50
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,600
just like Mama Imelda did.

51
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,600
No music!

52
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,140
No music!

53
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,000
Y aunque la vida

54
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,310
No music!

55
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,740
I think we're
the only family in Mexico

56
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,710
who hates music.

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,710
And my family's fine
with that. But me...

58
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,060
Be back by lunch, mijo.
Love you, Mama.

59
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,630
I am not like
the rest of my family!

60
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,290
Hola, Miguel!
Hola!

61
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,480
Muchas gracias.
De nada, Miguel.

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,050
Hey! Dante!

63
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,220
Sit. Down.
Roll over. Shake.

64
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,010
Fist bump!

65
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,230
Good boy, Dante!

66
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,420
I know I'm not
supposed to love music.

67
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,990
But it's not my fault!
It's his!

68
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,890
Ernesto de la Cruz.

69
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,830
The greatest musician
of all time.

70
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,760
Right here
in this very plaza,

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,330
Ernesto de la Cruz
took his first steps...

72
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,900
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Mexican history.

73
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,810
He started out a total
nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.

74
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,850
But when he played music, he made
people fall in love with him.

75
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,950
He starred in movies.

76
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,250
He had the coolest guitar!
He could fly!

77
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,820
And he wrote the best songs.

78
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,060
But my all-time favorite,
it's...

79
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,090
Remember me

80
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,360
Remember me

81
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,230
Though I have
to say goodbye

82
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,100
Remember me
Remember me

83
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,710
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you

85
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,710
 Each night we are apart
Remember me

86
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,710
Though I have
to travel far

87
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,380
Remember me
 Remember me

88
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,720
 Each time you hear
a sad guitar

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,390
 Know that I'm with you
the only way that I can be

90
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,390
 Until you're
in my arms again 

91
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,210
He lived the kind
of life you dream about.

92
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,610
Until 1942.

93
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,550
When he was crushed
by a giant bell.

94
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,020
I want to be just like him.

95
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,180
Sometimes,
I look at de la Cruz

96
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,420
and I get this feeling
like we're connected.

97
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,370
Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.

98
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,030
If it wasn't for my family.

99
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,430
Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.
Huh?

100
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,870
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

101
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,900
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

102
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,170
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

103
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,170
If I were you,

104
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,340
I'd march right up
to my family and say...

105
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,940
Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it.

106
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,880
I could never say that.

107
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,410
You are a musician, no?

108
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,810
I don't know.

109
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,350
I mean, I only
really play for myself.

110
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,420
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician

111
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,320
by hiding his skills?

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,460
No! He walked out
onto that plaza

113
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,460
and he played out loud.

114
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,930
Mira, mira, they're
setting up for tonight!

115
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,330
The music competition
for Dia de Muertos.

116
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,070
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

117
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,970
Uh-uh.
My family would freak!

118
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,660
Look, if you're too scared then,
well, have fun making shoes.

119
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,360
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

120
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,360
Seize your moment?

121
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Show me what
you got, muchacho.

122
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,800
I'll be your first audience.

123
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,540
Miguel!

124
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,370
Abuelita!
What are you doing here?

125
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,300
You leave my grandson alone.

126
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,400
Dona, please!

127
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,570
I was just getting
a shine.

128
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,840
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

129
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,380
He was just
showing me his guitar.

130
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,180
Shame on you.

131
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,480
My grandson is a sweet little
angelito querido cielito.

132
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,220
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.

133
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,550
You keep away from him.

134
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,990
Ay, pobrecito.
Oh, estas bien, mijo.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,230
You know better than to
be here in this place!

136
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,620
You will come home. Now.

137
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,280
How many times
have we told you?

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,650
That plaza is
crawling with mariachis.

139
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,890
Yes, Tio Berto.

140
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,020
No, no, no, no, no!
Ah! Go away, you. Go!

141
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,290
It's just Dante.

142
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,420
Never name a street dog.

143
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,480
They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.

144
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,340
I found your son
in Mariachi Plaza.

145
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,400
Ay, Miguel!

146
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,040
You know how Abuelita
feels about the plaza.

147
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,340
I was just shining shoes.

148
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,910
A musician's shoes!

149
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,050
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

150
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,680
If Abuelita says no more
plaza, then no more plaza.

151
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,090
But what about tonight?
What's tonight?

152
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,920
Well, they're having
this talent show.

153
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
And I
thought I might...

154
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,690
Sign up?
Well, maybe?

155
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,060
You have to have
talent to be in a talent show.

156
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,030
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes?

157
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,500
It's Dia de los Muertos.

158
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,940
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

159
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,760
Ofrenda room. Vamonos.

160
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,350
Don't give me that look.

161
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,190
Dia de los Muertos
is the one night of the year

162
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,230
our ancestors
can come visit us.

163
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,460
We've put their photos
on the ofrenda

164
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,360
so their spirits
can cross over.

165
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,330
That is very important.

166
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,230
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

167
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,970
We made all this food,

168
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,610
set out the things
they loved in life, mijo.

169
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,980
All this work
to bring the family together.

170
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,250
I don't want you sneaking
off to who knows where.

171
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,680
Where are you going?

172
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,220
I thought
we were done.

173
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,350
Ay, Dios mio. Being part
of this family means

174
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,220
being here for this family.

175
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,490
I don't want
to see you end up like...

176
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,660
Like Mama Coco's papa?

177
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,130
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

178
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,230
But you're the one who...

179
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,400
I was just...

180
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,660
But... I...

181
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,030
Papa? Papa is home?

182
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,000
Mama, calmese, calmese.

183
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,770
Papa is coming home?

184
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,890
No, Mama.
It's okay. I'm here.

185
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,640
Who are you?

186
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,250
Rest, Mama.

187
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,420
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.

188
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,600
Miguel? Miguel?

189
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,690
What are we going
to do with that boy?

190
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,750
You're right.
That's just what he needs.

191
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,420
It's you. Get in here.

192
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,490
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

193
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,460
You're gonna
get me in trouble, boy.

194
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,050
Someone could hear me.

195
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,740
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.

196
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,060
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

197
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,790
Perfecto!

198
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,780
I have to sing.
I have to play!

199
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,530
The music, it's not
just in me, it is me.

200
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,440
When life gets me down,
I play my guitar.

201
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,560
The rest of the world
may follow the rules,

202
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,440
but I must follow my heart.

203
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,500
Ugh!

204
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,300
You know that feeling like
there's a song in the air and...

205
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,420
it's playing just for you?

206
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,710
 A feeling so close...

207
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,030
 You could
reach out and touch it

208
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,550
 I never knew

209
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,700
 I could want something
so much, but it's true 

210
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,260
You must have faith, sister.

211
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,690
Oh, but, Padre,
he will never listen.

212
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,730
He will listen. To music.

213
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,330
 Only a song,
only a song

214
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,020
 Has the power
to change a heart 

215
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,160
Never underestimate
the power of music.

216
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,880
But my father, he will
never give his permission.

217
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,520
I am done
asking permission.

218
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,690
When you see your moment, you
mustn't let it pass you by.

219
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,590
You must seize it!

220
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,820
Senor de la Cruz,

221
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,870
what did it take for you
to seize your moment?

222
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,330
I had to have
faith in my dream.

223
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,300
No one was going
to hand it to me.

224
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,600
It was up to me
to reach for that dream.

225
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,570
Grab it tight
and make it come true.

226
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,190
...and make it come true.

227
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,350
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

228
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,520
I'm gonna play in Mariachi
Plaza if it kills me.

229
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,590
Dia de los Muertos has begun!

230
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,860
No, no. We have to make
a clear path.

231
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,500
The petals guide
our ancestors home.

232
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,530
We don't want
their spirits to get lost.

233
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,240
We want them to come
and enjoy all the food

234
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,850
and drinks on the ofrenda.

235
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,300
Mama!

236
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,670
Where should we
put this table?

237
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,380
In the courtyard, mijos.

238
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,540
You want it
down by the kitchen?

239
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,950
Si. Next to the other one.

240
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,490
Get under! Get under!
Miguel?

241
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,920
Nothing! Mama, Papa. I...

242
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,790
Miguel, your abuelita had
the most wonderful idea.

243
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,030
We've all decided. It's time
you joined us in the workshop!

244
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,500
What?
No more shining shoes.

245
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,440
You'll be making them
every day after school.

246
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,510
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to

247
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,970
carrying on
the family tradition.

248
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,640
And on Dia de los Muertos!

249
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,450
Your ancestors
will be so proud.

250
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,850
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tia Victoria.

251
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,520
And wingtips
like your Papa Julio.

252
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,060
But what if
I'm no good at making shoes?

253
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,430
Ah, Miguel. You have your
family here to guide you.

254
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,010
You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is...

255
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,570
A shoemaker.
Through and through.

256
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,610
That's my boy!
Berto!

257
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,570
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

258
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,200
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

259
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,780
No, no, no, no, no! No.

260
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,910
De la Cruz's guitar?

261
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,370
Papa? Papa?

262
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,490
Mama Coco, is your papa
Ernesto de la Cruz?

263
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,130
Papa! Papa!

264
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,870
Papa! Papa! It's him!

265
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,740
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was.

266
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,780
Miguel, get down
from there.

267
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,550
Mama Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!

268
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,850
What are you talking about?

269
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,930
I'm gonna be a musician!

270
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,950
What is all this?

271
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,060
You keep secrets
from your own family?

272
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,390
It's all that time
he spends in the plaza.

273
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,790
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.

274
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,390
It's not a fantasy.

275
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,660
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz!

276
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,530
The greatest musician
of all time!

277
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,070
We've never known anything
about this man!

278
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,800
But whoever he was, he still
abandoned his family.

279
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,440
This is no future
for my son.

280
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,980
But, Papa, you said
my family would guide me.

281
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,540
Well, de la Cruz
is my family.

282
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,080
I'm supposed to play music.

283
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,410
Never! That man's music
was a curse.

284
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
I will not allow it.

285
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,950
If you would just let...
Miguel...

286
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,550
You will listen
to your family.

287
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,850
No more music.

288
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,000
Just listen to me play!
End of argument.

289
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,490
You want to end up
like that man? Forgotten?

290
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,900
Left off
your family's ofrenda?

291
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,030
I don't care if I'm on
some stupid ofrenda.

292
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,040
No!
Mama!

293
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,580
There. No guitar.
No music.

294
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,790
Oh, come. You'll feel better
after you eat with your family.

295
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,900
I don't want
to be in this family!

296
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,370
Miguel! Miguel!

297
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,680
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz.

298
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,880
Can I still sign up?

299
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,550
You got an instrument?

300
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,880
No. But if I
can borrow a guitar...

301
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,750
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

302
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,220
You find a guitar, kid,

303
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,940
I'll put you on the list.

304
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,630
Can I borrow your guitar?
Sorry, muchacho.

305
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,630
You guys have a spare guitar?
No.

306
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,770
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.

307
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,350
Get out of here, kid.

308
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,530
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

309
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,720
No, no, no, no.

310
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,590
Dante, stop! Callate! Shh!

311
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,570
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,660
Senor de la Cruz,
please don't be mad.

313
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,020
I'm Miguel.

314
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,610
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

315
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,170
Our family thinks
music is a curse.

316
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,070
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

317
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,840
You would have told me
to follow my heart.

318
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,360
To seize my moment!

319
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,650
So, if it's
all right with you,

320
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,370
I'm gonna play in the plaza.
Just like you did!

321
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,060
The guitar! It's gone!

322
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,360
Somebody stole
de la Cruz's guitar!

323
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,670
The window's broken.
Look!

324
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,840
All right, who's in there?

325
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,680
I'm sorry.
It's not what it looks like.

326
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,190
De la Cruz is my...

327
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,560
There's nobody here.

328
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,360
Miguel!
Mama!

329
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,000
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?

330
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,840
Dios mio!
Little boy. Are you okay?

331
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,560
Here. Let me help you.

332
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,230
Thanks. I...

333
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,740
Do you mind? Whoa!

334
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,010
Look how big she's getting.

335
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,050
Dante!

336
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,050
You can see me? Wait!

337
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,110
What's going on? Dante!

338
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,290
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Miguel?

339
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,080
Miguel?
Miguel?

340
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,170
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

341
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,810
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

342
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,310
Remind me how I know you.

343
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,290
We're your family, mijo.

344
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,100
Tia Rosita?
Si.

345
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,270
Papa Julio?
Hola.

346
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,460
Tia Victoria?

347
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,960
He doesn't
seem entirely dead.

348
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,860
He's not quite alive either.

349
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,460
We need Mama Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

350
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,470
Oye! It's Mama Imelda.

351
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,870
She couldn't cross over.

352
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,300
She's stuck!
On the other side!

353
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,110
Tio Oscar? Tio Felipe?

354
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,210
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

355
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,840
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.

356
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,980
But if Mama Imelda
can't come to us...

357
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,250
Then we are going to her.
Vamonos!

358
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,530
Whoa.

359
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,280
Come on, Miguel.
It's okay.

360
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,470
Dante? Dante!
Dante, wait up!

361
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,740
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

362
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,580
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

363
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,550
You thought we weren't?
Well, I don't know.

364
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,420
I thought it might've been
one of those

365
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,350
made up things
that adults tell kids.

366
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,920
Like vitamins.

367
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,060
Miguel,
vitamins are a real thing.

368
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,230
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

369
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,300
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

370
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,970
Ay! Santa Maria!

371
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,040
Are those...
Alebrijes! But those are...

372
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,580
Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.

373
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,450
They guide souls
on their journey.

374
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,920
Watch your step. They
make caquitas everywhere.

375
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,120
Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.

376
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,960
Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.

377
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,190
Welcome back.
Anything to declare?

378
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,660
Some churros.
From my family.

379
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,660
How wonderful. Next.

380
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,530
If you are
experiencing travel issues,

381
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,270
agents at
the Department of Family...

382
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,500
Reunions are
available to assist you.

383
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,280
Next family, please.

384
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,340
Oh! Your photos
are on your son's ofrenda.

385
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,710
Have a great visit.

386
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,980
Gracias.

387
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,010
And remember
to return before sunrise.

388
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,210
Enjoy your visit.

389
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,550
Next.

390
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,090
Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda.
Enjoy your visit.

391
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,870
Gracias.
Next?

392
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,390
Yes! It is I.
Frida Kahlo.

393
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,960
Shall we skip
the scanner?

394
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,680
I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just
overwhelm your blinky thingy.

395
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,970
Well, shoot, looks like no one
put up your photo, Frida.

396
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,240
Okay, when I said I was Frida,
just now, that was a lie.

397
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,640
And I apologize
for doing that.

398
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,510
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.

399
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,300
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

400
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,430
Hey!

401
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,730
Almost... there.
Just a little further.

402
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,600
Upsy-daisy...

403
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,010
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

404
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,110
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

405
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,410
Next?
Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn.

406
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,350
Welcome back, amigos.
Anything to declare?

407
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,770
As a matter of fact, yes.

408
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,470
Hola.

409
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,460
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.

410
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,350
Please report to Level Seven.

411
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,390
Whoa!

412
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,630
I miss my nose.

413
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,620
Come on, help us out, amigo.

414
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,090
We got to get to
a dozen ofrendas tonight.

415
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,230
We are not visiting your ex-wife's
family for Dia de Muertos!

416
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,760
I demand to speak
to the person in charge!

417
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,670
I'm sorry, senora, it says
here no one put up your photo.

418
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,240
My family always puts my
photo on the ofrenda.

419
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,340
That devil box tells
you nothing but lies!

420
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,110
Mama Imelda?
Oh, mi familia!

421
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,710
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.

422
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,220
Tell this woman
and her devil box

423
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,750
that my photo
is on the ofrenda.

424
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,220
Well, we never
made it to the ofrenda.

425
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,940
What?
We ran into...

426
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,750
Miguel?
Mama Imelda.

427
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,500
What is going on?

428
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,800
You the Rivera family?

429
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,770
Well, you're cursed.

430
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,910
What?

431
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,540
Dia de los Muertos is the
night to give to the dead.

432
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,140
You stole from the dead!

433
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,510
But I wasn't
stealing the guitar.

434
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,650
Guitar?

435
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,250
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.

436
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,550
He would have
wanted me to have it.

437
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,690
Ah, ah, ah. We do not speak
of that musician.

438
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,420
He is dead to this family.

439
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,390
Uh,
you're all dead.

440
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,130
I am sorry.
Whose alebrije is that?

441
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,390
That's just Dante.

442
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,530
He sure doesn't
look like an alebrije.

443
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,130
He just looks
like a plain old dog.

444
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,400
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

445
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,170
Whatever he is, I am
terribly allergic.

446
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,840
But Dante
doesn't have any hair.

447
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,540
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

448
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,450
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.

449
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,130
Oh!

450
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,320
You took my photo
off the ofrenda?

451
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,420
It was an accident!
How do we send him back?

452
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,160
Well,
since it's a family matter...

453
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,590
the way to undo
a family curse

454
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,330
is to get your family's blessing.
That's it?

455
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,730
Get your family's blessing

456
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,330
and everything should
go back to normal.

457
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,370
But you got
to do it by sunrise.

458
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,300
What happens at sunrise?

459
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,160
Hijole! Your hand!

460
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,180
Whoa, Miguel, can't have
you fainting on us.

461
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,750
But not to worry.
Your family's here.

462
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,790
You can get
your blessing right now.

463
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,760
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.
Aha! Perdon, senora.

464
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,730
Oh.

465
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,640
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

466
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,560
Miguel.

467
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,870
Nailed it. Now say,
I give you my blessing.

468
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,920
I give you my blessing.

469
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,740
I give you my blessing
to go home...

470
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,910
to put my photo
back on the ofrenda,

471
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,350
and to never
play music again.

472
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,220
What? She can't do that!

473
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,480
Well, technically, she can
add any condition she wants.

474
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,620
Fine.

475
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,840
Then you hand
the petal to Miguel.

476
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,720
No skeletons!

477
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,090
Mariachi Plaza,
here I come.

478
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,510
Two seconds and you already
break your promise.

479
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,390
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

480
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,460
Papa Julio,
I ask for your blessing.

481
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,560
Tia Rosita? Oscar?

482
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,430
Felipe? Tia Victoria?

483
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:49,830
Don't make this hard, mijo.
You go home my way or no way.

484
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,700
You really hate
music that much?

485
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,850
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

486
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,480
The same path he did.
He's family.

487
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,280
Listen to your Mama Imelda.

488
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,550
She's just
looking out for you.

489
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,610
Be reasonable.

490
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,950
Con permiso,
I need to visit the restroom.

491
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,740
Be right back.

492
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,690
Uh, should we tell him
there are no restrooms

493
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,010
in the Land of the Dead?

494
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,210
Vamonos.

495
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,910
We got a family
looking for a living boy.

496
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,640
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

497
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,710
We got to find
my great-great-grandpa.

498
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,760
Hold it, muchacho.

499
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,720
I found that living boy!

500
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,950
Oh, whoa, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.

501
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,310
Excuse me.

502
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,570
Oh.

503
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,600
No, no. Dante!

504
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,630
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.

505
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,500
Falsifying a unibrow.

506
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,770
That's illegal?
Very illegal.

507
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,870
You need to clean up
your act, amigo.

508
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,610
Amigo? Oh, that's so nice
to hear you say that

509
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,410
because I have just had a...

510
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,350
really hard Dia de Muertos
and I could really use

511
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,350
an amigo right now.

512
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,090
And amigos,
they help their amigos.

513
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,790
You get me across
that bridge tonight,

514
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,390
and I'll make it
worth your while.

515
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,490
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

516
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,830
I can get you front row seats to
his Sunrise Spectacular show.

517
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,030
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

518
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,770
You just got to let me
cross that bridge!

519
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,940
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

520
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,040
But my shift's almost up and I
want to visit my living family.

521
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,760
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.

522
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,850
Can I at least
get my costume back?

523
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,650
Uh... No.

524
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,130
Some amigo.

525
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,060
Hey! Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?

526
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,690
Who wants to... Ahh!
Ay! You're alive!

527
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,390
Shh! Yeah, I'm alive.

528
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,460
And if I want to get back
to the Land of the Living...

529
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,930
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

530
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,530
That's weirdly specific.

531
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,070
He's my
great-great-grandfather.

532
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,650
He's your Gr... What?

533
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,000
Ugh.

534
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,860
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

535
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,810
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

536
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,950
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

537
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,950
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...

538
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,690
No, no, nino! Nino, nino, I can help you.
You can help me.

539
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,820
We can help each other.

540
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,690
But most importantly,
you can help me.

541
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,190
Miguel!
I'm Hector.

542
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,740
That's nice.

543
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,080
Esperame, chamaco!

544
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,480
Ay, he is going
to get himself killed.

545
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,100
I need my spirit guide...
Pepita.

546
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,860
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?

547
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,980
Here. Nice alebrije.

548
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,330
Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up.

549
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,750
Aqui arriba, eso...
Eh, la rayita.

550
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,340
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

551
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,880
Dead as a doorknob.

552
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,930
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

553
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,170
When you're well remembered,

554
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,030
people put up your photo
and you get to...

555
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,640
cross the bridge
and visit the living

556
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,100
on Dia de Muertos.
Unless you're me.

557
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,910
You don't get
to cross over?

558
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,170
No one's ever
put up my picture.

559
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,960
But you can change that!

560
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,940
This is you?

561
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,580
Eh, muy guapo, eh?

562
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,680
So, you get me
to my great-great-grandpa...

563
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,580
then I put up your photo
when I get home?

564
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,260
Such a smart boy! Yes!
Great idea, yes! One hiccup.

565
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,190
De la Cruz is
a tough guy to get to

566
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,990
and I need to
cross the bridge soon.

567
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Like, tonight.

568
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,960
So, you got any other
family here, you know?

569
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,100
Someone a bit more,
eh, accessible?

570
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,930
Mmm... Nope.

571
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,270
Don't yank my chain,
chamaco.

572
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,870
You got to have
some other family.

573
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,210
Only de la Cruz.

574
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,240
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

575
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,110
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid.
Fine! Fine!

576
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,990
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.

577
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,150
It's not gonna
be easy, you know?

578
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,290
He's a busy man.
What are you doing?

579
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,950
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.

580
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,760
No. Skeletons
don't walk like that.

581
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,830
It's how you walk.
No, I don't! Stop it!

582
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,770
Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular?

583
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,570
Que padre!

584
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,700
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

585
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,140
to mark the end
of Dia de Muertos.

586
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,710
And you can get us in!
Um...

587
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,980
Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!

588
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,180
That... was a lie.
I apologize for that.

589
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,350
Cool off, chamaco.
Come on. I'll get you to him.

590
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,450
How?

591
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,570
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

592
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:23,310
 Remember me
Don't let it make you cry 

593
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,870
You better have
my dress, Hector.

594
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,250
Hola, Ceci.

595
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,350
Hola.
Ceci, I lost the dress.

596
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,020
Ya lo sabia!

597
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,280
I got to dress
forty dancers by sunrise.

598
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,150
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

599
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,240
Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.

600
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,490
No, no, Dante! Ven aca!

601
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,190
You! How did you
get in here?

602
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,360
I just followed my...
Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

603
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,330
Guider of wandering spirits.

604
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,360
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?

605
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,730
I don't think
he's a spirit guide.

606
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,730
Ah, ah, ah.

607
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,800
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

608
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,120
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

609
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,560
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

610
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,990
You are the audience.
Darkness.

611
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,210
And from the darkness,
a giant papaya.

612
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Dancers emerge
from the papaya,

613
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,230
and the dancers are all me.

614
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,970
And they go to drink from
the milk of their mother,

615
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,170
who is a cactus.

616
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,910
But who is also me.

617
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:15,230
And her milk is
not milk but tears.

618
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,250
Is it too obvious?

619
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,980
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

620
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,390
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

621
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,260
Oh! And then it could go...

622
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,730
And what if
everything was on fire?

623
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,940
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

624
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,140
Inspired! You have
the spirit of an artist.

625
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,010
The dancers exit. The music
fades, the lights go out.

626
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,350
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!

627
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,450
Huh?

628
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,790
He does a couple of songs, the
sun rises, everyone cheers...

629
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,320
Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?

630
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,430
Ernesto doesn't do
rehearsals!

631
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,340
He's too busy hosting that fancy
party at the top of his tower.

632
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,970
Chamaco, you can't run off
on me like that.

633
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,800
Stop pestering
the celebrities.

634
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,970
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

635
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,840
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

636
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,250
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

637
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,180
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

638
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,050
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

639
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,050
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?

640
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,490
It's the hot ticket!

641
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,090
But if you're not
on the guest list,

642
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,530
you're never
getting in, Chorizo.

643
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,330
Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito!

644
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,960
A-ha. Very funny, guys.
Very funny.

645
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,200
Chorizo?

646
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,330
Oh, this guy's famous!

647
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,470
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.

648
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,100
I don't want
to talk about it.

649
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,240
He choked on some chorizo!

650
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,080
I didn't choke, okay?

651
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.

652
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,850
This is why
I don't like musicians.

653
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,480
Bunch of
self-important jerks.

654
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,990
Hey! I'm a musician!
You are?

655
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,820
If you really want
to get to Ernesto,

656
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,220
there is that
music competition...

657
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,890
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

658
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,440
Winner gets
to play at his party.

659
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
No, no. Chamaco,
you're loco if you think...

660
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,840
I need to get my
great-great-grandfather's blessing!

661
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,720
You know where
I can get a guitar?

662
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:25,590
I know a guy.

663
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,250
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

664
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,260
A footprint!
It's a Rivera boot.

665
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,130
Size seven!
And a half.

666
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,580
Pronated.
Miguel.

667
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,010
Why the heck would
you want to be a musician?

668
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,880
My great-great-grandpa
was a musician!

669
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,410
Who spent his life
performing like a monkey

670
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,210
for complete strangers.

671
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,620
No thank you.
No! Guacala!

672
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,480
What do you know?

673
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,890
So, how far is
this guitar anyway?

674
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,270
We're almost there.

675
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,680
Keep up, chamaco. Come on.

676
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,040
Cousin Hector!
Hey! These guys! Hey, Tio!

677
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,180
Que onda?

678
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,640
These people are
all your family?

679
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,010
Uh...

680
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,350
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or ofrendas.

681
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,490
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

682
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,640
So, we all call each other
cousin, or tio, or whatever.

683
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,580
Hector!
Tia Chelo!

684
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,470
Muchas gracias!

685
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,000
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharron around?

686
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,170
Eh, in the bungalow.

687
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,670
I don't know if he's in
the mood for visitors.

688
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,960
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Hector?

689
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,990
Buenas noches, Chicharron!

690
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,420
I don't want to see
your stupid face, Hector.

691
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,490
Come on.
It's Dia de Muertos.

692
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,090
I brought you
a little offering.

693
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,160
Get out of here.
I would, Cheech.

694
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,810
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

695
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,670
We really need
to borrow your guitar.

696
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,240
My guitar?
Yes.

697
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,540
My prized beloved guitar?

698
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,370
I promise
we'll bring it right back.

699
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:41,040
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

700
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,510
Uh...
Or my mini-fridge?

701
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,250
Ah, you see...
Or my good napkins?

702
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,080
My lasso? My femur?

703
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,310
Well, no,
not like those times.

704
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,650
Where is my femur?
You...

705
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,650
Whoa, whoa.

706
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,570
You okay, amigo?
I'm fading, Hector.

707
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,590
I can feel it.

708
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,780
I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

709
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,540
You play me something.

710
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,600
No. You know
I don't play anymore, Cheech.

711
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,540
The guitar is for the kid.

712
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,330
You want it,
you got to earn it.

713
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,600
Ay, only for you, amigo.

714
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,550
Any requests?

715
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,640
You know my favorite, Hector.

716
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:48,830
 Well,
everyone knows Juanita

717
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,400
 Her eyes
each a different color

718
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,770
 Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in

719
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,370
 And her...

720
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,460
 Knuckles they
drag on the floor

721
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,100
Those aren't the words.
There are children present.

722
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,850
 Her hair is like a briar

723
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:18,790
 She stands in
a bow-legged stance

724
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,790
 And if I weren't so ugly

725
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,000
 She'd possibly
give me a chance 

726
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,410
Brings back memories.

727
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,550
Gracias.

728
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,800
Wait. What happened?

729
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,840
He's been forgotten.

730
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,400
When there's no one left
in the living world

731
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,740
who remembers you...

732
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,540
you disappear
from this world.

733
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,480
We call it
the final death.

734
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,680
Where did he go?

735
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,950
No one knows.

736
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:38,150
But I've met him. I could
remember him when I go back!

737
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,490
No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco.

738
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,460
Our memories,
they have to be passed down

739
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,290
by those
who knew us in life...

740
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,160
in the stories
they tell about us.

741
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,020
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

742
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,500
Hey, it happens
to everyone eventually.

743
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,490
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

744
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,590
You told me
you hated musicians.

745
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,890
You never said you were one.

746
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,360
How do you think I
knew your great-great-grandpa?

747
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,590
We used to play
music together.

748
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,560
Taught him
everything he knows.

749
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,830
No manches! You played
with Ernesto de la Cruz...

750
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:25,730
the greatest musician
of all time?

751
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,500
Ah, you're funny.

752
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,470
Greatest eyebrows
of all time maybe.

753
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,470
But his music?
Eh, not so much.

754
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,660
You don't know
what you're talking about.

755
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,580
Welcome
to the Plaza de la Cruz!

756
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,830
Showtime, chamaco!

757
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,240
Llevelo!
T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

758
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,240
Bienvenidos a todos!

759
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
Oh!

760
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,770
Who's ready for some musica?

761
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,410
It's a battle
of the bands, amigos.

762
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:12,480
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself,

763
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,520
Ernesto de la Cruz...

764
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,350
at his fiesta tonight!

765
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,890
That's our ticket, muchacho.

766
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,020
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

767
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,930
Let the competition begin!

768
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,510
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

769
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,910
Definitely Remember Me.

770
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,310
No! Not that one. No.

771
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,380
Come on.
It's his most popular song!

772
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,680
Ah, it's too popular.

773
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,790
 Remember me
Though I have to travel far 

774
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,950
 Remember me... 

775
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,950
 Don't let it
make you cry... 

776
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,960
What about Poco Loco?
Epa! Now that's a song!

777
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,870
De la Cruzcito?
You're on standby.

778
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,880
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.

779
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,970
Los Chachalacos!

780
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,080
You always this nervous
before a performance?

781
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:25,420
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

782
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,360
What? You said
you were a musician!

783
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,320
I am!
I mean, I will be.

784
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:30,730
Ay!
Once I win.

785
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,330
That's your plan?
No. You have to win.

786
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,900
Your life
literally depends on...

787
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,460
you winning. And you've
never done this before!

788
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,630
I'll go up there.

789
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,970
No! I need to do this.
Why?

790
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:42,440
If I can't go out
and play one song,

791
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,340
how can I call
myself a musician?

792
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,710
What does that matter?

793
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,610
Because I don't just want to
get de la Cruz's blessing...

794
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:52,110
I need to prove
that I'm worthy of it.

795
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,020
Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment

796
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,490
at such a bad time!

797
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,060
Okay! Okay.
You want to perform?

798
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,860
Then you got to perform!

799
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,860
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

800
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,600
Now give me
your best grito.

801
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,350
My best grito?
Come on, yell! Belt it out.

802
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,960
Ah, it feels good.
Okay, now you.

803
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,970
Oh, come on, kid.

804
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,630
De la Cruzcito,
you're on now!

805
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,900
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, look at me.

806
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,100
You can do this.

807
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,640
Grab their attention
and don't let it go.

808
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,840
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.

809
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,440
De la Cruzcito

810
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,650
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?

811
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,950
Bring back
the singing dogs!

812
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,150
Que bien!
Vamonos! Whoo!

813
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,110
 What color is the sky?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

814
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,950
 You tell me that it's red
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

815
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:39,620
 Where should I put my shoes?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

816
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,860
 You say
put them on your head

817
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,620
 Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

818
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:49,130
 You make me un poco loco
Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco

819
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,870
 The way you keep me guessing
I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing

820
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,570
 I'll count
it as a blessing

821
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:59,220
 That I'm only
un poco loco

822
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,830
No! No! No!

823
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,850
Not bad for a dead guy!

824
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,650
Not so bad yourself,
gordito! Eso!

825
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,160
He's close! Find him!

826
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,030
 The loco that you make me
It is just un poco crazy

827
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,900
 The sense
that you're not making

828
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,900
 The liberties you're taking

829
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:36,230
 Leaves my cabeza shaking
You're just un poco loco

830
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,050
We're looking
for a living kid.

831
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,290
About twelve?

832
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,790
Have you seen a living boy?

833
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:56,410
 Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-
ti-ti-ti-to loco 

834
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:09,160
Hey! You did good!
I'm proud of you. Eso!

835
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,100
Otra! Otra! Otra!

836
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,920
Hey! Where are you going?
We got to get out of here!

837
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,410
What? Are you crazy? We're
about to win this thing.

838
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,090
Damas y caballeros,

839
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,130
I have an emergency
announcement.

840
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,830
Please be on the lookout
for a living boy.

841
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,730
Answers to the name
of Miguel.

842
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,970
Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

843
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:40,110
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

844
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,680
Wait, wait.

845
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,340
You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

846
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,280
The only person
who could send you home.

847
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,450
I do have other family,
but...

848
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,720
You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?

849
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,690
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

850
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,990
You lied to me!
Oh, you're one to talk.

851
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,990
Look at me.
I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

852
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,990
I don't even know
if I'm gonna last the night.

853
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,360
I'm not gonna
miss my one chance

854
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,430
to cross that
bridge because...

855
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:03,630
you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

856
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,730
It's not stupid!

857
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:05,970
I'm taking you
to your family.

858
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,200
Let go of me!
You'll thank me later.

859
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,710
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

860
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,840
Keep your dumb photo.
Stay away from me!

861
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,280
No!

862
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,500
Hey, chamaco!
Where did you go?

863
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,300
Chamaco! I'm sorry!
Come back!

864
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,770
Dante, callate! No!
Dante, stop it.

865
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,180
He can't help me.

866
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,270
Dante! Stop!

867
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,810
Stop it! Leave me alone!

868
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,940
You're not a spirit guide.
You're just a dumb dog!

869
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,140
Now get out of here!

870
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,950
It's him!
It's that living boy!

871
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,950
I heard about him. Look!
He's alive!

872
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,150
He's alive.
The boy is alive!

873
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,030
This nonsense
ends now, Miguel!

874
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,900
I am giving you my blessing
and you are going home.

875
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,550
I don't want your blessing!

876
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,690
Miguel, stop!

877
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,690
Come back! Miguel!

878
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,220
I am trying
to save your life!

879
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,350
You're ruining my life!
What?

880
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,920
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.

881
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,090
And you want to
take it away.

882
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,370
You'll never understand.

883
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:46,200
 Y aunque la vida
me cueste, Llorona

884
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,290
 No dejare de quererte... 

885
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,340
I thought you hated music.

886
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:58,980
Oh, I loved it!
I remember that feeling...

887
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,750
when my husband would play,
and I would sing

888
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,400
and nothing else mattered.

889
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,760
But when we had Coco,

890
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,260
suddenly there was something
in my life that...

891
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:17,400
mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.

892
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,450
He wanted
to play for the world.

893
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,910
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

894
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,240
Now you must make a choice.

895
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,140
But I don't
want to pick sides!

896
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,510
Why can't you be
on my side?

897
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,780
That's what
family's supposed to do.

898
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,740
Support you.
But you never will.

899
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,280
Have a good time.
Oh, how exciting!

900
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,760
Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan!
You mind if I...

901
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,600
Gracias, Senor.

902
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,060
Invitation?
It's okay.

903
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,610
I'm Ernesto's
great-great-grandson.

904
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,980
Disculpen, senores...
Hey, guys! It's poco loco!

905
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,350
You were on fire tonight!
You too!

906
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:43,130
Hey, musician to musician...
I need a favor.

907
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,410
Oh, the competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.

908
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,550
Thanks, guys!

909
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,610
Whoa!

910
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,520
Hey! Enjoy the party,
little musico!

911
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,170
Gracias!

912
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,470
Oh!

913
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,310
Oh!

914
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,180
Look! It's Ernesto!

915
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,190
De la Cruz!

916
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,820
Senor de la Cruz!

917
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,910
Pardon me! Senor de la Cruz!
Senor de la...

918
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,590
When you see
your moment,

919
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,320
you mustn't let it
pass you by.

920
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,190
You must seize it.

921
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,470
This one has a wise spirit.

922
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,650


923
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,720
We're almost there, Dante.

924
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,260
Senor de la Cruz!
Senor de la...

925
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,620
But what can we do?
It is hopeless...

926
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,290
You must have faith, sister.

927
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:33,590
But Padre,
he will never listen.

928
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,550
He will listen... to music.

929
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,330
 Senoras y senores,
buenas tardes, buenas noches

930
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,360
 Buenas tardes, buenas
noches Senoritas y senores

931
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:13,970
 To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy! Que alegria

932
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,000
 For this music
is my language

933
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,690
 And the world
es mi familia

934
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,140
 For this music
is my language

935
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,730
 And the world
es mi familia

936
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,380
 For this music
is my language

937
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,350
 And the world
es mi familia

938
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,120
 For this music
is my lang... 

939
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,130
Are you all right, nino?

940
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,170
It's you!
You are that boy!

941
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,310
The one who came
from the Land of the Living.

942
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,410
You... know about me?

943
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:01,650
You are all anyone
has been talking about.

944
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,020
Why have you come here?

945
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:08,320
I'm Miguel.
Your great-great-grandson.

946
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:11,790
I... have
a great-great-grandson?

947
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,690
I need your blessing

948
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,030
so I can go back home
and be a musician.

949
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,700
Just like you.

950
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,540
The rest of our family,
they wouldn't listen.

951
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:24,590
But I hoped you would.

952
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,030
My boy, with a talent like
yours, how could I not listen?

953
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,180
Aww!

954
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,580
I have a great-great-grandson!

955
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,590
Look! It's Frida!
Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

956
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,610
It is an honor, Senora.
Gracias.

957
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,600
Hey, Negrete! Infante!

958
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,840
Have you met
my great-great-grandson?

959
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,740
My great-great-grandson.

960
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,310
He's alive!
And a musician to boot!

961
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,340
Dimple. No dimple.
Dimple. No dimple.

962
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,450
No dimple!

963
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,880
To our friendship.

964
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,770
I would move Heaven and
Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!

965
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,750
Poison!

966
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,090
You know,
I did all my own stunts.

967
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,940
 Though I have to say
goodbye Remember me... 

968
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,330
All of this
came from my amazing fans

969
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,730
in the Land of the Living.

970
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,770
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with!

971
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:34,370
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

972
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,650
No! It's all great!
But?

973
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,750
It's just...

974
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,150
I have been looking up to you
my whole life.

975
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,530
You're the guy
who actually did it!

976
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,420
But did you ever regret it?

977
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,840
Choosing music
over everything else?

978
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,790
It was hard.

979
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,850
Saying goodbye to my hometown.
Heading off on my own...

980
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,800
Leaving your family?

981
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,710
Si. But I could not have
done it differently.

982
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:10,310
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

983
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:14,730
And you, my great-great-grandson,
are meant to be a musician!

984
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:19,650
You and I,
we are artists, Miguel.

985
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,660
We cannot
belong to one family.

986
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,140
The world is our family.

987
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,580
Ooh! Ooh!
The fireworks have begun!

988
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,310
Soon the party will move across
town for my Sunrise Spectacular.

989
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:46,280
Miguel,
you must come to the show!

990
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,310
You will be
my guest of honor!

991
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,730
You mean it?
Of course, my boy.

992
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,590
I can't.

993
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:57,290
I have to get home
before sunrise.

994
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,610
Oh! I really do
need to get you home.

995
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,470
It has been an honor.

996
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,870
I am sorry
to see you go, Miguel.

997
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:10,750
I hope you die very soon.

998
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,960
You know what I mean.

999
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:19,780
Miguel, I give you my bless...

1000
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,850
We had a deal, chamaco.

1001
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:25,490
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

1002
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:28,320
Oh, Frida! I thought
you couldn't make it.

1003
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,490
You said
you'd take back my photo.

1004
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:31,890
You promised, Miguel.

1005
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,930
You know this, uh, man?

1006
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:37,680
Uh, I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

1007
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,930
Hector?

1008
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:43,220
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.

1009
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,380
My friend,
you're being forgotten.

1010
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,010
And whose fault is that?
Hector, please...

1011
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:53,810
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

1012
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:54,880
What?

1013
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,520
If I'm being forgotten,
it's because you never

1014
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,390
told anyone
that I wrote them!

1015
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:01,620
That's crazy! De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

1016
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,520
You want to tell him
or should I?

1017
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,930
Hector, I never meant
to take credit.

1018
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:09,500
We made a great team,
but you died...

1019
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,530
and I only sang your songs

1020
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,530
because I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

1021
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,270
Oh, how generous!

1022
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:18,510
You really did
play together.

1023
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:20,840
I don't want
to fight about it.

1024
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,680
I just want you
to make it right.

1025
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,730
Miguel can put my photo up, and
I can cross over the bridge.

1026
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,450
I can see my girl.

1027
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:32,420
Ernesto,
remember the night I left?

1028
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,950
That was a long time ago.

1029
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,590
We drank together
and you told me

1030
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,560
you would move
Heaven and Earth...

1031
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,530
for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1032
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,830
Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?

1033
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:46,570
What?
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1034
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:49,070
In the de la Cruz movie,
El Camino a Casa.

1035
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,470
I'm talking about
my real life, Miguel.

1036
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:53,310
No! It's in there. Look!

1037
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:54,680
Never were
truer words spoken.

1038
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,840
This calls for a toast.
To our friendship!

1039
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:00,550
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo.

1040
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:03,680
But in the movie, Don
Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1041
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:06,640
Salud!
Poison!

1042
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:13,090
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...

1043
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,700
We'd been performing
on the road for months.

1044
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,000
I got homesick...

1045
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,780
and I packed up my songs.

1046
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:20,370
You want to give up now

1047
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,840
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1048
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,870
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1049
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:26,870
I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.

1050
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:28,040
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1051
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,790
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

1052
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:37,120
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,

1053
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,230
then I'm sending you off
with a toast.

1054
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,060
To our friendship.

1055
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:49,680
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!

1056
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,770
You walked me
to the train station.

1057
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:58,640
But I felt
a pain in my stomach.

1058
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,910
I thought it must have been
something I ate.

1059
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,410
Perhaps it was
that chorizo, my friend.

1060
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,960
Or something I drank.

1061
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,230
I woke up dead.

1062
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,090
You poisoned me.

1063
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:18,630
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.

1064
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:22,280
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1065
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,380
I never thought that
you might have... That you...

1066
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,040
How could you?
Hector!

1067
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,390
Security! Security!

1068
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:39,130
You took everything
away from me! You rat!

1069
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,650
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.

1070
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:48,440
I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!

1071
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:52,930
I apologize.
Where were we?

1072
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,130
You were going to give me
your blessing.

1073
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,780
Yes. Uh, si.

1074
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,540
Miguel, uh,
my reputation...

1075
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,010
It is
very important to me.

1076
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:10,110
I would hate
to have you think...

1077
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:14,150
That you murdered Hector
for his songs?

1078
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:18,880
You don't think that.
Do you?

1079
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:23,870
I... No. Everyone
knows you're the good guy.

1080
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,180
Papa Ernesto, my blessing?

1081
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:39,910
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1082
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:43,040
What? But I'm your family!

1083
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:45,610
And Hector
was my best friend.

1084
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:49,010
Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.

1085
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,180
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes

1086
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:54,650
to seize your moment.

1087
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,240
I know you understand.

1088
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,170
No! No!

1089
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,800
Let go! No!

1090
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:30,560
Help!
Can anyone hear me?

1091
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,010
I want to go home.

1092
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:53,210
Hector?
Kid?

1093
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,080
Oh, Hector!
You were right.

1094
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,690
I should have gone
back to my family.

1095
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,250
They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,

1096
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,090
but I didn't listen.

1097
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:06,090
I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

1098
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,660
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid ofrenda.

1099
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:12,570
Hey, chamaco.
It's okay. It's okay.

1100
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:15,190
I told them I didn't care.

1101
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:22,060
Hector! Hector?

1102
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:25,980
She's forgetting me.

1103
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:29,260
Who?
My daughter.

1104
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:36,120
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1105
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,630
I just wanted
to see her again.

1106
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:42,310
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

1107
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,370
I wish I could apologize.

1108
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:49,370
I wish I could tell her that her
papa was trying to come home.

1109
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,960
That he loved her so much.

1110
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,190
My Coco...

1111
01:10:58,110 --> 01:10:59,930
Coco?

1112
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,130
Where did you get this?

1113
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:22,950
That's my Mama Coco.
That's my Mama Imelda.

1114
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,990
Is that you?

1115
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:34,130
We're...
Family?

1116
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:49,030
I always hoped
I'd see her again.

1117
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,430
That she'd miss me.

1118
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:55,520
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

1119
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:58,800
You know the worst part?

1120
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:01,070
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1121
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,680
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

1122
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,400
Give her the biggest hug.

1123
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:12,180
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

1124
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,450
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1125
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:18,360
You disappear...
from this one.

1126
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,230
You'll never get to see her.

1127
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:22,240
Ever again.

1128
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:28,370
You know,
I wrote her a song once.

1129
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:32,370
We used to sing it every
night at the same time.

1130
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:35,120
No matter
how far apart we were.

1131
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,750
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her

1132
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,700
one... last... time.

1133
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,420
 Remember me

1134
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:52,270
 Though I have to say
goodbye Remember me

1135
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,260
 Don't let it make you cry

1136
01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:02,130
 For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart

1137
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:08,090
 I sing a secret song to
you Each night we are apart

1138
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,380
 Remember me

1139
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,710
Papa!

1140
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:17,060
 Though I have to
travel far Remember me

1141
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,860
 Each time
you hear a sad guitar

1142
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:27,740
 Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be

1143
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:34,380
 Until you're in
my arms again

1144
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:43,060
 Remember me 

1145
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:52,920
He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.

1146
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,560
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

1147
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,330
I didn't write Remember Me
for the world.

1148
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,240
I wrote it for Coco.

1149
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:05,930
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

1150
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:09,200
Are you kidding? A minute ago I
thought I was related to a murderer.

1151
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,470
You're a total upgrade.

1152
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,110
My whole life,
there's been something...

1153
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,840
that made me different.

1154
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,130
And I never knew
where it came from.

1155
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:22,480
But now I know.
It comes from you.

1156
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:27,350
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

1157
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,130
I'm proud to be
his family!

1158
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,980
Dante?

1159
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:56,420
Dante!

1160
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,570
It's Dante!

1161
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:15,450
Imelda!
Hector.

1162
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,450
You look good.

1163
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:31,890
Dante! You knew he was my
Papa Hector the whole time!

1164
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:33,890
You are a real spirit guide.

1165
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:36,420
Who's the good spirit guide?
You are!

1166
01:15:47,330 --> 01:15:48,650
Whoa!

1167
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,590
Dante!

1168
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,540
There they are!

1169
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,890
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

1170
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:31,390
Gracias, Dios mio.
Que bueno.

1171
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:47,530
Mijo, I was so worried!

1172
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,780
Thank goodness
we found you in time.

1173
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:54,270
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

1174
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,540
Imelda.

1175
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:58,740
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

1176
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:02,380
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.

1177
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:04,380
He spends
five minutes with you

1178
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,110
and I have to fish him
out of a sinkhole!

1179
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,650
I wasn't in there
because of Hector.

1180
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:10,280
He was in there
because of me.

1181
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,550
He was just
trying to get me home!

1182
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:17,020
I didn't want to listen,
but he was right.

1183
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:19,310
Nothing's more
important than family.

1184
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,950
I'm ready
to accept your blessing.

1185
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:25,400
And your conditions.

1186
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,700
But first,
I need to find de la Cruz.

1187
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,570
To get Hector's photo.

1188
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:31,270
What?
So he can see Coco again.

1189
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,170
Hector should be
on our ofrenda.

1190
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,640
He's part of our family.

1191
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,110
He left this family!

1192
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,780
He tried to go home
to you and Coco.

1193
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,760
But de la Cruz
murdered him!

1194
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,560
It's true, Imelda.

1195
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,780
And so what if it's true?

1196
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,290
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

1197
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:49,390
and I'm just
supposed to forgive you?

1198
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:51,320
Imelda, I...

1199
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,560
Hector!

1200
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,910
I'm running out of time.
It's Coco.

1201
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:01,750
She's forgetting you.

1202
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,540
You don't have
to forgive him.

1203
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:07,860
But we shouldn't
forget him.

1204
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,680
I wanted to forget you.

1205
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,580
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...

1206
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,630
This is my fault.
Not yours.

1207
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:23,840
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1208
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:31,460
Miguel, if we help you
get his photo,

1209
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:33,200
you will return home?

1210
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,780
No more music?

1211
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:38,390
Family comes first.

1212
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:43,520
I can't forgive you.

1213
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:47,700
But I will help you.

1214
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:51,630
So, how do we get
to de la Cruz?

1215
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:55,400
I might know a way.

1216
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:48,420
Good luck, muchacho.
Gracias, Frida.

1217
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,190
Here, let me help you with...
Don't touch me!

1218
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:02,460
Everyone clear on the plan?
Find Hector's photo.

1219
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,290
Give it to Miguel.
Send Miguel home.

1220
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:06,140
Got your petals?

1221
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,790
Now, we just
have to find de la Cruz.

1222
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,110
Yes?

1223
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:12,880
Don't I know you?

1224
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:16,470
That's for murdering
the love of my life!

1225
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:18,540
Who... Who the...
She's talking about me!

1226
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,840
I'm the love of your life?

1227
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,610
I don't know.
I'm still angry at you.

1228
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:22,940
Hector!
How did you...

1229
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:25,880
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson.

1230
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,280
Grandson?
She's talking about me!

1231
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:32,450
You! Wait.
You're related to Hector?

1232
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,000
The photo!

1233
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,360
Uh...

1234
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,070
After him!

1235
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:43,430
Security! Ayudenme!

1236
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:46,500
You said love of your life.
I don't know what I said.

1237
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,920
That's what I heard.

1238
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,200
Places, Senor.
You're on in thirty seconds.

1239
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,670
Ay! Miguel! I have it!

1240
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:22,680
Oh!

1241
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:30,220
Hurry! Come on!

1242
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,910
Ladies and gentlemen...

1243
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:39,790
the one... the only...
Ernesto de la Cruz!

1244
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,930
Get her off the stage.

1245
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:01,690
Sing! Sing!

1246
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:12,100
 Ay, de mi Llorona

1247
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:17,740
 Llorona de azul celeste

1248
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:24,330
 Ay, de mi Llorona

1249
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:29,980
 Llorona de azul celeste

1250
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:36,910
 Y aunque la vida
me cueste, Llorona

1251
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:44,680
 No dejare de quererte

1252
01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:51,090
 Me subi al pino mas alto,
Llorona

1253
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,760
 A ver si te divisaba

1254
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,500
 Como el pino era tierno,
Llorona

1255
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,630
 Al verme llorar, lloraba

1256
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:08,870
 Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste

1257
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:15,780
 Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste

1258
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:19,790
 Y aunque la vida
me cueste, Llorona

1259
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:23,120
 No dejare de quererte

1260
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,390
Let go of me!

1261
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:27,090
 Y aunque la vida
me cueste, Llorona

1262
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:38,790
 No dejare de quererte

1263
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,920
 Ay, ay, ay 

1264
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:52,750
I forgot
what that felt like.

1265
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,370
You still got it.

1266
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:59,040
Oh.

1267
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,650
Miguel,
I give you my blessing.

1268
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:09,840
To go home,
to put up our photos

1269
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,600
and to never...

1270
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:14,020
Never play music again.

1271
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:19,930
To never forget how much
your family loves you.

1272
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:23,930
You're going home.

1273
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,460
You're not going anywhere.

1274
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,190
Imelda!

1275
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:33,630
Stay back!
Stay back!

1276
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:37,860
All of you, stay back.
Not one more step.

1277
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:41,150
Dante!

1278
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:46,840
Ernesto, stop!
Leave the boy alone.

1279
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,770
I've worked too hard, Hector.

1280
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:51,110
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.

1281
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:53,180
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1282
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,780
He's a threat!

1283
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,620
You think
I'd let him go back

1284
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,620
to the Land of the Living
with your photo?

1285
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,690
To keep
your memory alive? No.

1286
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:04,560
You're a coward!
I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

1287
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,490
The greatest musician
of all time!

1288
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:08,460
Hector's the real musician.

1289
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,760
You're just the guy
who murdered him

1290
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,000
and stole his songs!

1291
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,160
Murdered?

1292
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:14,100
I am the one
who's willing to do

1293
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,120
what it takes
to seize my moment.

1294
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,250
Whatever it takes.

1295
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:21,740
No!

1296
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:25,980
Miguel!

1297
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:29,730
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1298
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:14,560
Please,
please, mi familia.

1299
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,630
Murderer!

1300
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,130
Orchestra.
A-one, a-two, a-one...

1301
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,900
 Remember me
Though I have to s... 

1302
01:26:24,910 --> 01:26:26,210
Hey!

1303
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:28,820
Look!

1304
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,330
Nice kitty.

1305
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:59,070
Put me down! No, please! I beg of you!
Stop! Stop! No!

1306
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,360
No! No!

1307
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,190
What did I miss?

1308
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,000
Good boy, Dante!

1309
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,310
Miguel!

1310
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:31,070
Hector!
The photo... I lost it!

1311
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:34,010
It's okay, mijo.
It's o...

1312
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:36,920
Hector! Hector?

1313
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,940
Coco.

1314
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:41,380
No! We can still
find the photo.

1315
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:43,330
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1316
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:46,050
No, no. I can't leave you.

1317
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:48,620
I promised
I'd put your photo up.

1318
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,760
I promised you'd see Coco.

1319
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,140
We're both
out of time, mijo.

1320
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,360
Oh no! No!
She can't forget you!

1321
01:27:57,370 --> 01:28:01,550
I just wanted her to know
that I loved her.

1322
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,770
Hector!

1323
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:06,090
You have our blessing,
Miguel.

1324
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:08,840
No conditions.

1325
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,960
No! Papa Hector, please!

1326
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:17,160
No!

1327
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,290
Go home.

1328
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:22,500
I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

1329
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:51,100
There he is!

1330
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,200
Miguel! Stop!

1331
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,730
Where have you been?

1332
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:02,390
I need to see
Mama Coco, please.

1333
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,460
What are you doing with that...
Give it to me!

1334
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:09,270
Miguel, stop!
Miguel! Miguel!

1335
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,740
Mama Coco? Can you hear me?
It's Miguel.

1336
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:20,410
I saw your papa.
Remember? Papa?

1337
01:29:20,410 --> 01:29:26,820
Please! If you forget him,
he'll be gone. Forever.

1338
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,320
Miguel,
open this door!

1339
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,160
Here. This was
his guitar, right?

1340
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,640
He used to play it to you?

1341
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:39,330
See? There he is! Papa!

1342
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,550
Remember? Papa?

1343
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:46,040
Miguel!

1344
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,120
Mama Coco, please!
Don't forget him.

1345
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,380
What are you doing
to that poor woman?

1346
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,880
It's okay, Mamita.
It's okay.

1347
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:00,150
What's gotten into you?

1348
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:08,500
I thought
I'd lost you, Miguel.

1349
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,160
I'm sorry, Papa.

1350
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:13,510
We're all together now.
That's what matters.

1351
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,500
Not all of us.

1352
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,900
It's okay, Mamita.

1353
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,150
Miguel, you apologize
to your Mama Coco.

1354
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:26,160
Mama Coco?

1355
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,670
Well? Apologize!

1356
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,820
Mama Coco?

1357
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:42,510
Your papa,
he wanted you to have this.

1358
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:46,100
Mama, wait!

1359
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:50,280
 Remember me

1360
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:54,210
 Though I have
to say goodbye

1361
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:57,440
 Remember me

1362
01:30:57,450 --> 01:31:00,280
 Don't let it make you cry

1363
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:04,050
 For even if I'm far away

1364
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:10,050
 I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you

1365
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:13,540
 Each night we are apart

1366
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,960
 Remember me

1367
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:21,900
 Though I have
to travel far

1368
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,540
 Remember me

1369
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:29,510
 Each time
you hear a sad guitar

1370
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:35,360
 Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be

1371
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:41,600
 Until you're in
my arms again

1372
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:50,180
 Remember me 

1373
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:00,170
Elena? What's wrong, mija?

1374
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:04,660
Nothing, Mama.
Nothing at all.

1375
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:09,180
My papa used
to sing me that song.

1376
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:12,450
He loved you, Mama Coco.

1377
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:16,470
Your papa loved you so much.

1378
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,640
I kept his letters.

1379
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:43,360
Poems he wrote me. And...

1380
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,670
Papa was a musician.

1381
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:08,140
When I was a little girl...

1382
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:13,760
he and Mama would sing
such beautiful songs.

1383
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:28,030
And right over here,

1384
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:30,500
one of Santa Cecilia's
greatest treasures.

1385
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:35,000
The home of the esteemed
song writer, Hector Rivera.

1386
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,470
The letters Hector wrote home

1387
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:38,640
for his daughter, Coco,
contain the lyrics...

1388
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,570
for all of your
favorite songs.

1389
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:42,560
Not just Remember Me.

1390
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:48,480
And that man
is your Papa Julio.

1391
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,720
And there's Tia Rosita
and your Tia Victoria.

1392
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,350
And those two
are Oscar and Felipe.

1393
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,020
These aren't just old pictures,
they're our family...

1394
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,410
and they're counting on us
to remember them.

1395
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:23,460
 Say that I'm
crazy or call me a fool

1396
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:29,350
Enjoy your visit, Hector.

1397
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:34,340
 But last night it seemed
that I dreamed about you

1398
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:40,370
Papa!
Coco!

1399
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:45,240
 When I opened my mouth
what came out was a song

1400
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:51,330
 And you know every word
and we all sang along

1401
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:58,350
 To a melody played
on the strings of our souls

1402
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:03,290
 And a rhythm that rattled
us down to the bone

1403
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:08,440
 Our love for each other
will live on forever

1404
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:14,670
 In every beat
of my proud corazon

1405
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:19,440
 Our love for each other
will live on forever

1406
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:25,530
 In every beat
of my proud corazon

1407
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:33,120
 Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente

1408
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,120
 Canten a coro
Let it be known

1409
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:40,790
 Our love for each other
will live on forever

1410
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:45,500
 In every beat
of my proud corazon

1411
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:49,530
 Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente

1412
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:53,470
 Canten a coro
Let it be known

1413
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:57,440
 Our love for each other
will live on forever

1414
01:35:57,450 --> 01:36:02,130
 In every beat
of my proud corazon 

1415
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,860
 Remember me

1416
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:18,080
 Though I have to say
goodbye Remember me

1417
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:21,770
 Don't let it make you cry

1418
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:27,440
 For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart

1419
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:32,540
 I sing a secret song to
you Each night we are apart

1420
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:35,550
 Remember me

1421
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:40,790
 Though I have to
travel far Remember me

1422
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:44,620
 Each time
you hear a sad guitar

1423
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:49,890
 Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be

1424
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:54,870
 Until you're in
my arms again

1425
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:56,880
 Remember me

1426
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:55,730
 If you close your eyes
and let the music play

1427
01:37:55,730 --> 01:37:58,600
 Keep our love alive
I'll never fade away

1428
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:01,430
 If you close your eyes
and let the music play

1429
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,470
 Keep our love alive
I'll never fade away

1430
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:07,010
 If you close your eyes
and let the music play

1431
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:12,930
 Keep our love alive
I'll never fade away

1432
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:17,620
 Remember me

1433
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:22,590
 For I will soon be gone
Remember me

1434
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:26,020
 And let the love
we have live on

1435
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:31,760
 And know that I'm with you
the only way that I can be

1436
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:36,670
 So, until you're
on my arms again

1437
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:38,650
 Remember me

1438
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:46,860
 Remember me

1439
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:50,960
 Remember me

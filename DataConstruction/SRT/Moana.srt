00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,683
<i>In the beginning...</i>

3
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,686
<i>there was only ocean...</i>

4
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:03,815
<i>until the mother island emerged.</i>

5
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,817
<i>Te Fiti.</i>

6
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:10,196
<i>Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.</i>

7
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:13,324
<i>It could create life itself.</i>

8
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:17,704
<i>And Te Fiti shared it with the world.</i>

9
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,374
<i>But in time...</i>

10
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,544
<i>some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.</i>

11
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,838
<i>They believed
if they could possess it...</i>

12
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,633
<i>the great power of creation
would be theirs.</i>

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,178
<i>And one day...</i>

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,306
<i>the most daring of them all...</i>

15
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:40,852
<i>voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.</i>

16
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:47,025
<i>He was a demigod of the wind and sea.</i>

17
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,069
<i>He was a warrior.</i>

18
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,572
<i>A trickster.</i>

19
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,243
<i>A shapeshifter who
could change form...</i>

20
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:01,039
<i>with the power of his magical fish hook.</i>

21
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,375
<i>And his name...</i>

22
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,420
<i>was Maui.</i>

23
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:21,392
<i>But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...</i>

24
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,312
<i>giving birth to a terrible darkness.</i>

25
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,374
<i>Maui tried to escape...</i>

26
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,919
<i>but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.</i>

27
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,423
<i>Te Kā!</i>

28
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,593
<i>A demon of earth and fire.</i>

29
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:06,104
<i>Maui was struck from the sky...</i>

30
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,691
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

31
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:14,946
<i>And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...</i>

32
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,907
<i>were lost to the sea.</i>

33
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,243
Where, even now...

34
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,370
1,000 years later...

35
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,123
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

36
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,292
still hunt for the heart.

37
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,796
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

38
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,257
chasing away our fish...

39
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:37,635
draining the life
from island after island...

40
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:41,055
until every one of us is devoured...

41
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,892
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

42
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,811
of inescapable death!

43
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,651
But one day...

44
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,820
the heart will be found...

45
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:59,073
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,575
find Maui...

47
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,827
deliver him across the great ocean...

48
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,163
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

49
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,998
and save us all.

50
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,709
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

51
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,752
Papa.

52
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:12,670
No one goes outside the reef.

53
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,924
We are safe here. There is no darkness.

54
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,842
There are no monsters.

55
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:21,804
Monsters!

56
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,015
- There's no monsters, no monsters...
- it's the darkness!

57
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,186
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

58
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:29,479
I'm gonna throw up.

59
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,814
As long as we stay
on our very safe island...

60
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,816
we'll be fine.

61
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,443
The legends are true.

62
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,195
Someone will have to go.

63
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,530
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

64
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:42,367
Who would want to go anywhere else?

65
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:20,738
Shoo, shoo!

66
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,715
Moana!

67
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,858
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

68
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,652
What? I wanna's go back.

69
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,404
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.

70
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,532
It's dangerous.

71
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,536
Moana, come on.

72
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,704
Let's go back to the village.

73
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,750
You are the next great chief
of our people.

74
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,920
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

75
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:45,466
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

76
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,313
Moana

77
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,858
<i>Make way, make way</i>

78
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,901
<i>Moana, it's time you knew</i>

79
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:07,822
<i>The village of Motunui is all you need</i>

80
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,074
<i>The dancers are practicing</i>

81
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:12,577
<i>They dance to an ancient song</i>

82
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,580
<i>Who needs a new song
This old one's all we need</i>

83
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,665
<i>This tradition is our mission</i>

84
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,418
<i>And Moana, there's so much to do</i>

85
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,961
<i>Don't trip on the taro root</i>

86
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,255
<i>That's all you need</i>

87
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,382
<i>We share everything we make</i>

88
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,426
<i>We joke and we weave our baskets</i>

89
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,887
<i>The fishermen come back from the sea</i>

90
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,555
<i>I wanna see</i>

91
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,473
<i>Don't walk away</i>

92
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
<i>Moana, stay on the ground now</i>

93
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,603
<i>Our people will need a chief</i>

94
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,688
<i>- And there you are
- There you are</i>

95
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,732
<i>There comes a day</i>

96
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,611
<i>When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is</i>

97
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,613
<i>Where you are</i>

98
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,364
<i>Consider the coconut</i>

99
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,742
<i>- The what
- Consider its tree</i>

100
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:56,287
<i>We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need</i>

101
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,915
<i>We make our nets from the fibers</i>

102
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,917
<i>The water is sweet inside</i>

103
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,213
<i>We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside</i>

104
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,131
<i>Consider the coconuts</i>

105
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,050
<i>The trunks and the leaves</i>

106
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:11,719
<i>The island gives us what we need</i>

107
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,638
<i>And no one leaves</i>

108
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,264
<i>That's right, we stay</i>

109
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,058
<i>We're safe and we're well-provided</i>

110
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,143
<i>And when we look to the future</i>

111
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,811
<i>There you are</i>

112
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,648
<i>You'll be okay</i>

113
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,608
<i>In time you'll learn just as I did</i>

114
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:29,487
<i>You must find happiness
right where you are</i>

115
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:39,997
<i>I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves</i>

116
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:44,168
<i>The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves</i>

117
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:48,256
<i>The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far</i>

118
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,927
<i>But once you know what you like
Well, there you are</i>

119
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,975
<i>You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride</i>

120
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:03,437
<i>Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside</i>

121
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,775
<i>And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star</i>

122
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:11,445
<i>Moana, that voice inside
is who you are</i>

123
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,534
- Uh-huh.
- Dad!

124
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:20,162
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

125
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:27,461
Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

126
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:33,050
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

127
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,720
This is a sacred place.

128
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,888
A place of chiefs.

129
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,557
There will come a time...

130
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:44,687
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

131
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,398
Like I did. Like my father did.

132
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:51,569
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

133
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,738
And on that day...

134
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,157
when you add your stone...

135
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:59,869
you will raise this whole island higher.

136
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,830
You are the future of our people, Moana.

137
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,541
And they are not out there.

138
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,586
They are right here.

139
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:11,922
It's time to be who they need you to be.

140
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,509
<i>- We make our nets from the fibers
- We weave our nets from the fibers</i>

141
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,678
<i>- The water is sweet inside
- A real tasty treat inside</i>

142
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,014
<i>- We use the leaves to build fires
- We sing these songs in our choirs</i>

143
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,932
<i>- To cook up the meat inside
- We have mouths to feed inside</i>

144
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,934
<i>- The village believes in us
- That's right</i>

145
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,603
<i>The village believes</i>

146
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,938
<i>The island gives us what we need</i>

147
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,107
<i>And no one leaves</i>

148
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,609
<i>So here I'll stay</i>

149
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,613
<i>My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow</i>

150
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,823
<i>There we are</i>

151
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,784
<i>I'll lead the way</i>

152
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,952
<i>I'll have my people to guide me</i>

153
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,746
<i>We'll build our future together</i>

154
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:45,956
<i>Where we are</i>

155
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,833
<i>'Cause every path leads ya back to</i>

156
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,460
<i>Where you are</i>

157
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,921
<i>You can find happiness right</i>

158
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,964
<i>Where you are</i>

159
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,134
<i>Where you are</i>

160
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,475
And every storm, this roof leaks,
no matter how many fronds I add.

161
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:05,643
Fixed!

162
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,936
Not the fronds.

163
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,232
- Wind shifted the post.
- Ah!

164
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,360
Mmm! That's good pork!

165
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,489
Oh! I didn't mean... I wasn't...

166
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:22,660
What?
They're calling me, so I gotta... Bye!

167
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,329
Ow! Ow! Ow!

168
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,664
You're doing great.

169
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,249
Is it done yet?

170
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,752
So close.

171
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,562
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

172
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:54,650
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

173
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,736
Should we maybe just cook him?

174
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:02,116
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

175
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,995
Far beneath in some cases.

176
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:08,372
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei

177
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,623
than meets the eye.

178
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,756
It's the harvest.

179
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,302
This morning,
I was husking the coconuts and...

180
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,101
Well...

181
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:34,148
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.

182
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,232
There.

183
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,028
Thanks, Moana.

184
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,197
She's doing great.

185
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,577
This suits you.

186
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:47,745
Chief?

187
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,581
There's something you need to see.

188
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,583
Our traps in the east lagoon...

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,919
they're pulling up less and less fish.

190
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,755
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

191
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,090
Uh, we have. There's no fish.

192
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,427
Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.

193
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,637
We tried.

194
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,096
The windward side.

195
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,766
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

196
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,601
We've tried the whole lagoon.

197
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,103
They're just gone.

198
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,397
Have you tried using a different bait?

199
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,941
I don't think it's the bait.

200
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,609
There's no fish.

201
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,486
It seems like
it's getting worse and worse.

202
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,614
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

203
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,824
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

204
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,827
What if we fish beyond the reef?

205
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,122
No one goes beyond the reef.

206
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,750
I know. But if there are no fish
in the lagoon...

207
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,835
- Moana.
- And there's a whole ocean.

208
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,629
We have one rule.

209
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:39,964
An old rule, when there were fish.

210
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,091
- A rule that keeps us safe...
- But Dad, I...

211
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,178
instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.

212
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,354
Every time I think you're past this...

213
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,276
No one goes beyond the reef!

214
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,994
Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.

215
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,162
Standing on a boat.

216
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:17,167
I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.

217
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,336
But you still do.

218
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,215
- He's hard on you because...
- Because he doesn't get me.

219
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,968
Because he was you.

220
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,637
Drawn to the ocean.

221
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,180
<i>Down by the shore.</i>

222
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,975
<i>He took a canoe, Moana.</i>

223
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,602
<i>He crossed the reef...</i>

224
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,855
<i>and found an unforgiving sea.</i>

225
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:40,065
<i>Waves like mountains.</i>

226
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,361
<i>His best friend begged
to be on that boat.</i>

227
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,114
<i>Your dad couldn't save him.</i>

228
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,536
He's hoping he can save you.

229
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,372
Sometimes...

230
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,460
who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...

231
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,255
it's just not meant to be.

232
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:21,398
<i>I've been staring
at the edge of the water</i>

233
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,735
<i>Long as I can remember</i>

234
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,821
<i>Never really knowing why</i>

235
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:33,577
<i>I wish I could be the perfect daughter</i>

236
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,580
<i>But I come back to the water</i>

237
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,957
<i>No matter how hard I try</i>

238
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,004
<i>Every turn I take
Every trail I track</i>

239
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,049
<i>Every path I make
Every road leads back</i>

240
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,760
<i>To the place I know
Where I cannot go</i>

241
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,346
<i>Where I long to be</i>

242
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,015
<i>See the line where the
sky meets the sea</i>

243
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,434
<i>It calls me</i>

244
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,437
<i>And no one knows</i>

245
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,440
<i>How far it goes</i>

246
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:08,737
<i>If the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind me</i>

247
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:12,449
<i>One day I'll know</i>

248
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,829
<i>If I go, there's just no telling
how far I'll go</i>

249
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,040
<i>I know everybody on this island</i>

250
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,793
<i>Seems so happy on this island</i>

251
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,504
<i>Everything is by design</i>

252
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:31,009
<i>I know everybody on this island</i>

253
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,221
<i>Has a role on this island</i>

254
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,974
<i>So maybe I can roll with mine</i>

255
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,186
<i>I can lead with pride
I can make us strong</i>

256
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,897
<i>I'll be satisfied
If I play along</i>

257
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,317
<i>But the voice inside
Sings a different song</i>

258
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,361
<i>What is wrong with me</i>

259
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,117
<i>See the light as it shines on the sea</i>

260
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,995
<i>It's blinding</i>

261
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,205
<i>But no one knows</i>

262
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,834
<i>How deep it goes</i>

263
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,086
<i>And it seems like it's calling out to me</i>

264
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:09,047
<i>So come find me</i>

265
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,759
<i>And let me know</i>

266
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:15,387
<i>What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line</i>

267
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,598
<i>The line where the sky meets the sea</i>

268
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,517
<i>It calls me</i>

269
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,312
<i>And no one knows</i>

270
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,815
<i>How far it goes</i>

271
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,695
<i>If the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind me</i>

272
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,531
<i>One day I'll know</i>

273
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:39,995
<i>How far I'll go</i>

274
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,707
Whoa.

275
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,879
We're okay, Pua.

276
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,589
I can do this.

277
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,885
There's more fish beyond the reef.

278
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,806
There's more beyond the reef.

279
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,690
Not so bad.

280
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,450
Pua!

281
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,796
Whatever just happened...

282
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,298
blame it on the pig.

283
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,674
Gramma.

284
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,139
Are you gonna tell Dad?

285
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,726
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.

286
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,731
He was right.

287
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,483
About going out there.

288
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,989
It's time to put my stone
on the mountain.

289
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:44,161
Okay. Well, then, head on back.

290
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,663
Put that stone up there.

291
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,295
Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?

292
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,131
You said that's what you wanted.

293
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,091
It is.

294
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,847
When I die...

295
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,517
I'm going to come back as one of these.

296
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,812
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

297
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,648
Why are you acting weird?

298
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,318
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

299
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,656
If there's something you want to tell me,
just tell me!

300
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,659
Is there something you wanna tell me?

301
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,037
Is there something you want to hear?

302
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,878
You've been told
all our people's stories...

303
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,381
but one.

304
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,841
What is this place?

305
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,471
Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?

306
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,399
Ooh!

307
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,818
What's in there?

308
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:02,489
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

309
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,659
Who are you meant to be?

310
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,664
<i>Go inside...</i>

311
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,416
<i>bang the drum...</i>

312
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,876
<i>and find out.</i>

313
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,157
Whoa.

314
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,039
Oh.

315
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,988
Bang the drum.

316
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,624
<i>We read the wind and the sky</i>

317
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,626
<i>When the sun is high</i>

318
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,588
<i>We sail the length of the seas</i>

319
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,423
<i>On the ocean breeze</i>

320
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,134
<i>At night we name every star</i>

321
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,428
<i>We know where we are</i>

322
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:15,807
<i>We know who we are
Who we are</i>

323
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,770
<i>We set a course to find</i>

324
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:25,483
<i>A brand new island
everywhere we roam</i>

325
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,238
<i>We keep our island in our mind</i>

326
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,408
<i>And when it's time to find home</i>

327
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,452
<i>We know the way</i>

328
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,457
<i>We are explorers reading every sign</i>

329
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:45,629
<i>We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain</i>

330
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,847
<i>We know the way</i>

331
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,438
We were voyagers.

332
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,690
We were voyagers!

333
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,736
We were voyagers! We were voyagers!

334
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,655
We were voyagers!

335
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,616
Why'd we stop?

336
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,785
Maui.

337
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,997
<i>When he stole from the mother island,
darkness fell.</i>

338
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,500
<i>Te Kā awoke.</i>

339
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,420
<i>Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.</i>

340
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,841
<i>To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...</i>

341
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,845
and now we have forgotten who we are.

342
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,933
And the darkness
has continued to spread...

343
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,185
chasing away our fish...

344
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,104
draining the life...

345
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,899
from island after island.

346
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,113
Our island.

347
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:55,573
But, one day...

348
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,828
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...

349
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,914
deliver him across the great ocean...

350
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,460
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

351
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,215
I was there that day.

352
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:15,218
The ocean chose you.

353
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,104
I thought it was a dream.

354
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,778
Nope!

355
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:38,450
Our ancestors
believed Maui lies there...

356
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,368
at the bottom of his hook.

357
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:43,621
Follow it, and you will find him.

358
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:47,250
But why would it choose me?

359
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,462
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

360
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,256
But I know who does!

361
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:02,557
The crops
are turning black.

362
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,517
What about the fish?

363
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,353
This is happening all over the island.

364
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,979
- Please, please settle down.
- What are you going to do?

365
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,814
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...

366
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,400
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!

367
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,110
There's a cavern of boats.

368
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,820
Huge canoes.

369
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:19,574
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

370
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,203
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

371
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,041
You told me to help our people.

372
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,460
This is how we help our people.

373
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:31,878
Dad?

374
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:32,962
What are you doing?

375
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,632
I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!

376
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,841
No! Don't!

377
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,552
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!

378
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,054
There is no heart!

379
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,889
This is just a rock!

380
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:43,973
No!

381
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,489
Chief! It's your mother!

382
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,167
Mother...

383
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,810
What can be done?

384
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,109
Go.

385
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,986
Gramma.

386
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:41,739
Go.

387
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,701
Not now. I can't.

388
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,202
You must!

389
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,747
The ocean chose you.

390
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,416
Follow the fish hook.

391
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,584
Gramma...

392
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,836
And when you find Maui...

393
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:58,840
you grab him by the ear. You say...

394
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:02,260
"I am Moana of Motunui.

395
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,846
"You will board my boat...

396
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,390
"sail across the sea...

397
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:11,561
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

398
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,732
I can't leave you.

399
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:21,404
There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.

400
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,752
Go!

401
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,391
<i>There's a line
where the sky meets the sea</i>

402
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,393
<i>And it calls me</i>

403
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,480
<i>But no one knows</i>

404
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:59,317
<i>How far it goes</i>

405
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:04,447
<i>All that time wondering where I need
to be is behind me</i>

406
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,575
<i>I'm on my own</i>

407
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,620
<i>To worlds unknown</i>

408
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,831
<i>Every turn I take
Every trail I track</i>

409
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:15,708
<i>Is a choice I make</i>

410
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,461
<i>Now I can't turn back
from the great unknown</i>

411
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:22,048
<i>Where I go alone
Where I long to be</i>

412
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,810
<i>See her light up the night in the sea</i>

413
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,646
<i>She calls me</i>

414
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,440
<i>And yes, I know</i>

415
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,068
<i>That I can go</i>

416
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:47,240
<i>There's a moon in the sky
And the wind is behind me</i>

417
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,785
<i>Soon I'll know</i>

418
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,413
<i>How far I'll go</i>

419
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:17,729
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...

420
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:22,275
sail across the sea
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

421
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,985
I am Moana...

422
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,487
of Motu...

423
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,240
nui.

424
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:41,878
Heihei?

425
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,445
It's okay. You're all right.

426
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,238
See?

427
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,450
There we go. Nice water.

428
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:15,119
The ocean is a friend of mine.

429
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,456
Heihei?

430
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:20,750
Heihei!

431
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:36,849
Stay.

432
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,692
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

433
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,369
I am Moana of Motunui.

434
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:59,664
You will board my boat...

435
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,668
sail... across the sea...

436
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:05,962
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

437
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:11,134
I am Moana of Motu...

438
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,511
Board my boat!

439
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:17,557
Oh, no.

440
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,565
No, no, no!

441
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:38,995
Ocean...

442
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,081
can I get a little help?

443
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:46,669
No, no.

444
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,172
Please.

445
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,465
Come on!

446
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:03,269
Help me!

447
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,771
Please!

448
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:43,559
Whew!

449
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:49,774
Um...

450
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:50,983
What?

451
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,944
I said help me!

452
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,279
And wrecking my boat?

453
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,448
Not helping!

454
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:02,036
Fish pee in you all day!

455
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,329
So...

456
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,344
Maui?

457
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,853
Maui!

458
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,608
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

459
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,485
I am Moana of Motunui.

460
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,195
You will board my boat.

461
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,281
No. You will board my boat.

462
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:41,200
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

463
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,120
You will board my...

464
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,372
Boat! A boat!

465
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:49,208
The gods have given me a...

466
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,141
Maui, shapeshifter...

467
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,435
demigod of the wind and sea...

468
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,604
- I am Moana of...
- Hero of men.

469
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:11,188
What?

470
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,816
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

471
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,151
hero of men.

472
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:18,237
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

473
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,198
I am...

474
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,533
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

475
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,994
And women. Men and women.

476
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,162
Both. All.

477
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,914
Not a guy, girl thing.

478
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,832
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

479
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,167
You're doing great.

480
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,044
What? No! I'm here to...

481
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,587
Of course.

482
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,922
Yes, yes, yes.

483
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,883
Maui always has time for his fans.

484
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,427
When you use a bird to write with...

485
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:44,347
it's called tweeting.

486
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,853
I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.

487
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:53,856
You are not my hero.

488
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,567
And I'm not here
so you can sign my oar!

489
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,362
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

490
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,572
And you will board my boat...

491
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:04,909
and sail across the sea and put it back!

492
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,118
Um...

493
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:08,955
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

494
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,040
which is impossible because...

495
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,000
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

496
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,419
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

497
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,881
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

498
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:22,426
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

499
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:23,594
is "thank you."

500
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,221
- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.

501
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:26,389
What? No, no, no!

502
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:27,890
I didn't... I wasn't...

503
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,100
Why would I ever say that?

504
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,476
Okay, okay.

505
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,438
<i>I see what's happening
Yeah</i>

506
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,566
<i>You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange</i>

507
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,318
<i>You don't even know how you feel</i>

508
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,112
<i>It's adorable</i>

509
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,156
<i>Well it's nice to see that humans
never change</i>

510
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:47,576
<i>Open your eyes
Let's begin</i>

511
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:48,786
<i>Yes, it's really me</i>

512
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,913
<i>It's Maui
Breathe it in</i>

513
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,748
<i>I know it's a lot</i>

514
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,834
<i>The hair
The bod</i>

515
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,753
<i>When you're staring at a demigod</i>

516
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,589
<i>What can I say except</i>

517
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:01,757
<i>You're welcome</i>

518
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,261
<i>For the tides, the sun, the sky</i>

519
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,763
<i>Hey, it's okay, it's okay</i>

520
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,598
<i>You're welcome</i>

521
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:12,643
<i>I'm just an ordinary demiguy
Hey!</i>

522
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,938
<i>What has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky</i>

523
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,940
<i>When you were waddling yay high?</i>

524
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,233
<i>This guy</i>

525
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,738
<i>When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?</i>

526
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,115
<i>You're looking at him yo</i>

527
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:29,952
<i>Oh also I lassoed the sun</i>

528
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,412
<i>You're welcome</i>

529
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,956
<i>To stretch your days and bring you fun</i>

530
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,917
<i>Also I harnessed the breeze</i>

531
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,335
<i>You're welcome</i>

532
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,796
<i>To fill your sails and shake your trees</i>

533
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:44,925
<i>So what can I say except
You're welcome</i>

534
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,553
<i>For the islands I pulled from the sea</i>

535
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:50,347
<i>There's no need to pray
It's okay</i>

536
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:51,849
<i>You're welcome</i>

537
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:55,811
<i>Ha
I guess it's just my way of being me</i>

538
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:56,979
<i>You're welcome</i>

539
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,273
<i>You're welcome</i>

540
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:00,983
<i>Well come to think of it</i>

541
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,235
<i>Kid, honestly I could go on and on</i>

542
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,071
<i>I could explain every
natural phenomenon</i>

543
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:08,491
<i>The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh that was Maui just messing around</i>

544
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,493
<i>I killed an eel
I buried its guts</i>

545
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:11,994
<i>Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts</i>

546
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,954
<i>What's the lesson?
What is the take away?</i>

547
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,706
<i>Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway</i>

548
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:19,043
<i>And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win</i>

549
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:21,003
<i>Look where I've been
I make everything happen</i>

550
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,464
<i>Look at that
Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'</i>

551
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:25,174
<i>Ha ha
Ha ha</i>

552
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,218
<i>Ha ha
Hey</i>

553
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:30,346
<i>Well anyway let me say
You're welcome</i>

554
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:31,680
<i>You're welcome</i>

555
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,475
<i>For the wonderful world you know</i>

556
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:37,520
<i>Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome</i>

557
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:38,729
<i>You're welcome</i>

558
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:41,524
<i>Well come to think of it
I gotta go</i>

559
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,568
<i>Hey it's your day to say
You're welcome</i>

560
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,861
<i>You're welcome</i>

561
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,531
<i>'Cause I'm gonna need that boat</i>

562
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,784
<i>I'm sailing away away
You're welcome</i>

563
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:52,910
<i>You're welcome</i>

564
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,329
<i>'Cause Maui can do
everything but float</i>

565
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,373
<i>- You're welcome
- You're welcome</i>

566
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,708
<i>- You're welcome
- You're welcome</i>

567
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:00,876
Huh?

568
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,211
And thank you!

569
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,130
Hey!

570
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,716
Let me out! You lying, slimy son of a...

571
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,387
<i>You're welcome</i>

572
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:14,515
You're so welcome.

573
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,356
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

574
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,440
I'm going to get my hook.

575
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,734
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

576
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,113
Okay, talk to the back.

577
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,078
Boat snack.

578
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,733
Good riddance,
you filthy pile of pebbles.

579
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,569
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

580
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,280
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

581
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:15,034
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

582
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,620
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

583
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:43,145
I could watch that all day.

584
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,980
Okay. Enjoy the island.

585
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,482
Maui, out.

586
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:48,067
No! Stop!

587
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:50,152
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

588
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,420
Did not see that coming.

589
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:13,592
I am Moana of Motunui.

590
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,094
This is my canoe...

591
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,845
and you will journey to...

592
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,725
All right, get over it. We gotta move.

593
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:24,937
And she's back.

594
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:27,648
I am Moana of Motunui...

595
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:33,988
it was Moana, right?

596
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,197
Yes.

597
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,866
And you will restore the heart!

598
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,379
All right. I'm out.

599
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:56,885
Oh, come on!

600
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,555
What is your problem?

601
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:03,058
Are you afraid of it?

602
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,727
No! No.

603
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,270
I'm not afraid.

604
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:12,234
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

605
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:13,402
You, stop it.

606
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,238
That is not a heart. it is a curse.

607
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:18,532
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

608
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:19,867
and I lost my hook.

609
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:21,201
Get it away from me.

610
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,037
Get this away?

611
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,164
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

612
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,999
Stop that. I will smite you!

613
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,834
You wanna get smote?

614
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,002
Smotten?

615
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,672
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

616
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,549
it's a homing beacon of death.

617
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:38,010
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

618
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,179
Come for this? The heart?

619
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:41,388
You mean this heart right here?

620
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:42,473
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

621
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,058
Come and get it!

622
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:45,434
You are gonna get us killed!

623
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:49,104
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
so you can put it back.

624
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:50,272
Thank you.

625
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,607
You're welcome.

626
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:57,613
Kakamora.

627
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,031
Kaka-what?

628
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:00,616
Murdering little pirates.

629
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:04,203
Wonder what they're here for.

630
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,918
They're kinda cute.

631
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:29,686
Ocean!

632
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,647
Do something! Help us!

633
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,233
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

634
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,901
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

635
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,071
You can't sail?

636
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:40,614
I, uh...

637
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,324
I am self-taught.

638
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,838
Can't you shapeshift or something?

639
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,047
Do you see my hook?

640
00:45:57,214 --> 00:45:58,799
No magic hook, no magic powers!

641
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,577
Their boat is turning into more boats!

642
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,682
Yep, I just did that.

643
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,522
No, no!

644
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,609
Heihei!

645
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,040
Maui!

646
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:14,208
They took the heart!

647
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:17,753
That's a chicken.

648
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,922
The heart is in the...

649
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:21,006
We have to get him back!

650
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:27,554
Maui!

651
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:30,140
Cheeeehoooo!

652
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:43,862
There! Right there!

653
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:45,030
You're turning?

654
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:46,323
What are you doing?

655
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:47,616
Escaping!

656
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:48,951
The heart!

657
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,911
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

658
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:53,080
Besides, you got a better one.

659
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:54,164
Hey!

660
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:55,249
What am I gonna steer with?

661
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:58,126
They're just gonna kill ya!

662
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,549
Coconuts.

663
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:47,634
Got it!

664
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:52,389
Hey!

665
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:09,406
Yeah!

666
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,491
We did it!

667
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:14,995
Congratulations
on not being dead, girlie.

668
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:16,538
You surprise me.

669
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,915
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

670
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:23,462
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

671
00:49:23,754 --> 00:49:24,963
Not to mention Te Kā.

672
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,883
Lava monster?

673
00:49:28,342 --> 00:49:30,052
Ever defeat a lava monster?

674
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,929
No. Have you?

675
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:43,649
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

676
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:47,027
You can't restore the heart without me...

677
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:48,945
and me says no.

678
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,406
I'm getting my hook.

679
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:53,408
End of discussion.

680
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:02,417
You'd be a hero.

681
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,797
That's what you're all about, right?

682
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:09,800
Little girl, I am a hero.

683
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:11,426
Maybe you were.

684
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:12,719
But now...

685
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:15,806
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

686
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:18,266
The guy who cursed the world.

687
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:21,019
You're no one's hero.

688
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:22,354
No one?

689
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,031
But...

690
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,200
put this back...

691
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:37,119
save the world...

692
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:39,287
you'd be everyone's hero.

693
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,129
Maui! Maui! Maui!

694
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:49,464
You're so amazing!

695
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,759
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

696
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:54,010
Then we get your hook.

697
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:57,889
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

698
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:00,684
Unless you don't wanna be...

699
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:03,979
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

700
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,647
Hero to...

701
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:07,232
all.

702
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,487
First, we get my hook.

703
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:14,239
Then save the world.

704
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:15,323
Deal?

705
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:16,450
Deal.

706
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:21,872
Worth a shot.

707
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:24,708
Okay, we go east.

708
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:27,043
To the lair of Tamatoa.

709
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:32,674
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

710
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:46,563
Teach me to sail.

711
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,235
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

712
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:53,403
I should...

713
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,698
I should be sailing.

714
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:58,867
It's called wayfinding, princess.

715
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,411
And it's not just sails and knots...

716
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:04,206
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

717
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,416
Knowing where you are...

718
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,168
by knowing where you've been.

719
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:10,670
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

720
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:12,297
I am the daughter of the chief.

721
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:13,632
- Same difference.
- No.

722
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:16,426
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

723
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:17,719
you're a princess.

724
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:19,095
You are not a wayfinder.

725
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:22,682
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

726
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,315
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

727
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:38,323
You are a bad person.

728
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,242
If you can talk, you can teach.

729
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:41,409
Wayfinding.

730
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:44,412
Lesson one. Hit it.

731
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,250
Pull the sheet.

732
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,627
Not the sheet.

733
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:51,795
No.

734
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:52,879
Nope.

735
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:55,006
Nope. No.

736
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:57,759
Tried that one already.

737
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:04,933
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

738
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,187
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

739
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:12,607
It's cold.

740
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,402
Wait, it's getting warmer.

741
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:19,531
Aah! That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

742
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:37,465
We're here?

743
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,677
See, told you I could do it!

744
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,395
Motunui?

745
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:53,189
I'm home?

746
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:58,528
- Moana!
- Dad?

747
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:00,989
Moana!

748
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:02,324
Mom?

749
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,868
Help!

750
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:07,746
No!

751
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,414
Moana!

752
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,002
Enjoy your beauty rest?

753
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:16,838
You know,
a real wayfinder never sleeps...

754
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:19,633
so they actually get
where they need to go.

755
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,676
Muscle up, buttercup.

756
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:23,803
We're here.

757
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:27,474
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

758
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,893
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

759
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:34,064
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

760
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:35,148
Ah!

761
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,776
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

762
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:40,487
my hook is the coolest collectible.

763
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:42,572
And he lives up there?

764
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:46,576
No, no, no.

765
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:48,161
That's just the entrance...

766
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:50,538
to Lalotai.

767
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:51,957
Lalotai?

768
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:53,875
Realm of monsters?

769
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,419
We're going to the realm of monsters?

770
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:59,047
We? No. Me.

771
00:54:59,506 --> 00:55:02,634
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

772
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,137
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

773
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:09,683
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

774
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:12,060
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

775
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:13,895
I know she's human,
but that's not the...

776
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:15,605
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

777
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:17,232
I'm not explaining it to you.

778
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:19,025
'Cause then it's not funny.

779
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:34,874
So, daughter of the chief...

780
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,501
I thought you stayed in the village.

781
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:38,378
You know, kissing babies and things.

782
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:41,297
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

783
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,883
why your people decided to send...

784
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,136
How do I phrase this? You.

785
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:49,556
My people didn't send me.

786
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:50,890
The ocean did.

787
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:52,267
The ocean?

788
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:53,435
Makes sense.

789
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,186
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

790
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:56,563
Obvious choice.

791
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,108
It chose me for a reason.

792
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:01,860
If the ocean's so smart...

793
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:05,113
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

794
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,032
Or bring me my hook?

795
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,451
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

796
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:12,328
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

797
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:15,415
You're the Chosen One!

798
00:56:31,014 --> 00:56:34,392
The ocean chose you for a reason.

799
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,145
If you start singing,
I'm gonna throw up.

800
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:39,981
So, not seeing an entrance.

801
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,317
Yes, because it only appears...

802
00:56:42,484 --> 00:56:44,319
after a human sacrifice.

803
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,697
Kidding.

804
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:49,115
So serious.

805
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:13,848
Don't worry...

806
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:16,184
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

807
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,352
Cheeeehoooo!

808
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,568
I am still falling!

809
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:28,863
You can do this.

810
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:30,698
Go!

811
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:54,430
And he sticks the landing.

812
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,723
Huh?

813
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,102
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

814
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,604
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...

815
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:02,814
Huh?

816
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:08,987
Well, she's dead.

817
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:11,656
Okay, let's get my hook.

818
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:23,918
Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew.

819
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,802
Maui's fishhook!

820
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,346
Yeah!

821
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,223
Sorry!

822
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,390
I thought you were a monster...

823
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:20,808
But I found your hook.

824
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:23,102
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

825
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,270
Stay.

826
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,648
What? No. I'm the one who found...

827
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,316
Listen. For a thousand years...

828
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:30,693
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

829
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,903
getting my hook...

830
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,655
and being awesome again.

831
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:36,199
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...

832
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:40,078
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...

833
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,331
Except...

834
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:44,707
maybe as bait.

835
00:59:44,874 --> 00:59:46,084
Huh?

836
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:47,835
Wow!

837
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:50,046
The shiny, glittery cave.

838
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:51,547
And just like me...

839
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:54,342
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

840
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:56,386
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

841
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,012
You're not selling it!

842
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:00,098
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

843
01:00:00,265 --> 01:00:02,725
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

844
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:07,230
Oh, when he shows up,
keep him distracted.

845
01:00:07,397 --> 01:00:08,898
Make him talk about himself.

846
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:11,192
He loves bragging about
how great he is.

847
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,860
You two must get along swell.

848
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:15,029
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

849
01:00:15,697 --> 01:00:17,365
You ripped off his...

850
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:18,533
Maui?

851
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:29,544
What have we here?

852
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:34,257
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

853
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,552
Ugh! It's a human!

854
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:41,389
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...

855
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:42,974
Just pick an eye, babe.

856
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:44,767
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

857
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,228
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

858
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,731
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

859
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,316
Don't! That's my gramma's!

860
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,567
"That's my gramma's!"

861
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:53,818
I ate my gramma!

862
01:00:53,985 --> 01:00:56,446
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

863
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,239
Why are you here?

864
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:00,908
'Cause you're amazing!

865
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:06,414
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

866
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:09,125
And I just had to know...

867
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:11,836
how you became so...

868
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,464
crabulous?

869
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:19,093
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

870
01:01:20,428 --> 01:01:22,138
Because if you are...

871
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:24,349
I will gladly do so.

872
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:25,433
Huh?

873
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:26,934
In song form!

874
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,774
<i>Well, Tamatoa
hasn't always been this glam</i>

875
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,276
<i>I was a drab little crab once</i>

876
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:39,364
<i>Now I know I can be happy as a clam</i>

877
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,783
<i>Because I'm beautiful, baby</i>

878
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,118
<i>And did your granny say</i>

879
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:45,995
<i>Listen to your heart</i>

880
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:48,956
<i>Be who you are on the inside</i>

881
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:52,460
<i>I need three words
To tear her argument apart</i>

882
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:53,961
<i>Your granny lied</i>

883
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:55,838
<i>I'd rather be shiny</i>

884
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:58,883
<i>Like a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreck</i>

885
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,512
<i>Scrub the deck
And make it look shiny</i>

886
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:05,515
<i>I will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neck</i>

887
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:08,226
<i>Just a sec
Don't ya know</i>

888
01:02:08,393 --> 01:02:12,230
<i>Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters</i>

889
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:13,856
<i>Beginners</i>

890
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:16,484
<i>Oh, and here they come, come, come</i>

891
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:18,694
<i>To the brightest thing that glitters</i>

892
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:19,862
<i>Mm, fish dinners</i>

893
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:22,407
<i>I just love free food</i>

894
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,868
<i>And you look like seafood</i>

895
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:29,080
Hey, crab cake!

896
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,377
I'm back.

897
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,922
It's Maui Time!

898
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:41,843
What do you say, little buddy?

899
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:44,554
Giant hawk? Coming up!

900
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,097
Cheeeehoooo!

901
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:52,103
Cheeeehoooo!

902
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:58,401
Well, well, well.

903
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,862
<i>Little Maui's having
trouble with his look</i>

904
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:03,823
<i>Ya little semi-demi-mini-god</i>

905
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:06,617
<i>Ouch
What a terrible performance</i>

906
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:08,202
<i>Get the hook
Get it?</i>

907
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:11,080
<i>You don't swing it
Like you used to, man</i>

908
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:14,709
<i>Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start</i>

909
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:17,837
<i>And your tattoos on the outside</i>

910
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:21,340
<i>For just like you
I made myself a work of art</i>

911
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:23,551
<i>I 'll never hide
I can't</i>

912
01:03:23,718 --> 01:03:24,760
<i>I'm too shiny</i>

913
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,889
<i>Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough</i>

914
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:31,392
<i>Strut my stuff
My stuff is so shiny</i>

915
01:03:31,601 --> 01:03:34,061
<i>Send your armies
But they'll never be enough</i>

916
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,898
<i>My shell's too tough
Maui, man</i>

917
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,443
<i>You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod</i>

918
01:03:41,277 --> 01:03:43,446
<i>To beat a decapod
Look it up</i>

919
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:45,406
<i>You Will die, die, die</i>

920
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,408
<i>Now it's time for me to take apart</i>

921
01:03:48,117 --> 01:03:49,911
<i>Your achin' heart</i>

922
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:54,665
<i>Far from the ones who abandoned you</i>

923
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:59,504
<i>Chasing the love of these humans</i>

924
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:02,632
<i>Who made you feel wanted</i>

925
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:05,426
<i>You tried to be tough</i>

926
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:09,639
<i>But your armor's just not hard enough</i>

927
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:13,601
<i>Maui
Now it's time to kick your heinie</i>

928
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:17,396
<i>Ever seen someone so shiny</i>

929
01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:20,691
<i>Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see</i>

930
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:22,443
<i>C'est la vie
Mon ami</i>

931
01:04:22,652 --> 01:04:24,111
<i>I'm so shiny</i>

932
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:27,073
<i>Now I eat you so
prepare your final plea</i>

933
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,366
<i>Just for me</i>

934
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:32,119
<i>You'll never be quite as shiny</i>

935
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:36,457
<i>You wish you were nice and shiny</i>

936
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:40,336
- Hey!
- Huh?

937
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:42,797
I got something shiny for ya!

938
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:47,301
The heart of Te Fiti.

939
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:49,804
You can't run from me!

940
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:51,973
Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

941
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,686
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

942
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,442
The power of creation...

943
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:05,278
for a crustacean.

944
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:06,904
Where is it? Where is it?

945
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:09,156
We gotta go!

946
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:10,825
What about the heart?

947
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:13,494
He can have it. I've got a better one.

948
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:16,163
Yes, I have the...

949
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,331
Wait a minute.

950
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:20,334
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

951
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:23,671
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

952
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:27,049
Come back here!

953
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:33,848
Cheeeehoooo!

954
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,975
Hey!

955
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:37,685
Did you like the song?

956
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:46,569
We're alive!

957
01:05:46,736 --> 01:05:47,737
We're alive!

958
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:50,698
Listen...

959
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:52,783
I appreciate what you did down there.

960
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,118
Mm-hmm.

961
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:55,244
- Took guts.
- Mm-hmm.

962
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:56,579
- But...
- Mm-hmm.

963
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:57,747
I'm sorry.

964
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:00,958
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

965
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,044
No, no. No way!

966
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,463
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

967
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:09,550
shark head.

968
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:12,887
What? Do you have a shark head?

969
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:14,764
Look, the point is...

970
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:17,808
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

971
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,519
who had no business
being down there...

972
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,438
you did me a solid.

973
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:24,690
But you also almost died.

974
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:26,901
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

975
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,236
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

976
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:30,571
Bupkis.

977
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:33,991
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

978
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,409
It's not cursed.

979
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,119
Shark head.

980
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:39,997
It is not cursed.

981
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:55,179
Cursed.

982
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,435
<i>What can I say except</i>

983
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:03,437
<i>We're dead soon</i>

984
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:05,106
<i>We're dead soon</i>

985
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:08,067
Can you at least try?

986
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:12,446
Giant hawk.

987
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:17,410
<i>Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon</i>

988
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:20,204
All right, break time's over.

989
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:21,372
Get up.

990
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:23,874
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

991
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:27,795
Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

992
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:30,631
Take a hike, Tiny.

993
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:39,140
How do you get your tattoos?

994
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,767
They show up. When I earn them.

995
01:07:42,727 --> 01:07:45,563
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

996
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:49,024
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

997
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:50,317
What's Nunya?

998
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:51,819
Nunya business.

999
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,780
I'll just keep asking.

1000
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:58,033
What's it for?

1001
01:07:58,743 --> 01:08:00,828
You need to stop doing that.

1002
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,209
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

1003
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:08,836
I said back off.

1004
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:10,671
Is it why your hook's not working?

1005
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:29,440
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1006
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:31,859
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1007
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:33,944
throw me off.

1008
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:37,448
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

1009
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:39,575
I know I don't.

1010
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:43,704
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1011
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,581
You're right.

1012
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:50,211
But my island is dying...

1013
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:54,048
so I am here.

1014
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:57,092
It's just me and you.

1015
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,929
And I want to help...

1016
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:04,391
but I can't if you don't let me.

1017
01:09:09,772 --> 01:09:12,316
I wasn't born a demigod.

1018
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,110
I had human parents.

1019
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:21,450
They took one look and decided...

1020
01:09:21,617 --> 01:09:24,078
they did not want me.

1021
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,539
They threw me into the sea...

1022
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:30,125
like I was nothing.

1023
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:35,130
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1024
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:36,924
They gave me the hook.

1025
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:38,759
They made me...

1026
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:40,594
Maui.

1027
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:44,640
And back to the humans I went.

1028
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:48,978
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1029
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:52,273
Anything they could ever want.

1030
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:55,276
You took the heart for them.

1031
01:09:55,985 --> 01:09:58,863
You did everything for them.

1032
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:01,532
So they'd love you.

1033
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:05,286
It was never enough.

1034
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:16,714
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1035
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:20,050
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1036
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:24,305
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1037
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:29,143
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1038
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:31,061
You are.

1039
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,364
Okay, okay.

1040
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:45,826
I love you, too, buddy.

1041
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:36,877
Cheeeehoooo!

1042
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:52,810
Yeah!

1043
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:19,628
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1044
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:07,468
What?

1045
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,136
I figured it out.

1046
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:14,183
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1047
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:18,145
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1048
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:21,774
All those new lands, new villages.

1049
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:24,610
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1050
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,653
And if I were the ocean...

1051
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:30,908
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1052
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:33,494
to start that again.

1053
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:38,040
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1054
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:41,210
Probably should have saved it
for Te Fiti.

1055
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:43,921
I did.

1056
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:48,926
Moana of Motunui...

1057
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:54,723
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1058
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:58,352
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1059
01:13:58,811 --> 01:14:00,604
You're so amazing!

1060
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:03,398
It's time.

1061
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,252
Go save the world.

1062
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:26,380
Cheeeehoooo!

1063
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:48,694
Maui!

1064
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:23,896
What are you doing?

1065
01:15:24,146 --> 01:15:25,814
Finding you a better way in!

1066
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:29,193
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

1067
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:30,485
- Turn around!
- No!

1068
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:31,778
Moana, stop!

1069
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:32,946
No!

1070
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:02,643
Are you okay?

1071
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:05,187
Maui?

1072
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:14,947
I told you to turn back.

1073
01:16:17,241 --> 01:16:18,992
I thought we could make it.

1074
01:16:19,326 --> 01:16:20,410
We?

1075
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:23,956
I thought I could make it.

1076
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:27,042
We can fix it.

1077
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:29,336
It was made by the gods.

1078
01:16:29,503 --> 01:16:31,255
You can't fix it!

1079
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:33,757
Next time we'll be more careful.

1080
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:36,093
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

1081
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,679
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1082
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,847
We can find a way around.

1083
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:42,849
I'm not going back.

1084
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:45,560
We still have to restore the heart.

1085
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:47,229
My hook is cracked.

1086
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:49,064
One more hit, and it's over.

1087
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,316
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1088
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,360
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1089
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:54,695
That's not true!

1090
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:57,364
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1091
01:17:06,915 --> 01:17:08,166
We are only here...

1092
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:11,461
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

1093
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:15,382
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...

1094
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:17,342
and you believed it.

1095
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:21,096
I am Moana of Motunui.

1096
01:17:21,263 --> 01:17:23,473
- You will board my boat...
- Goodbye, Moana.

1097
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,808
Sail across the sea...

1098
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:26,059
I'm not killing myself...

1099
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:27,477
so you can prove
you're something you're not!

1100
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:28,895
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1101
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,982
The ocean chose me!

1102
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:34,651
It chose wrong.

1103
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:45,454
Maui!

1104
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:02,929
Why did you bring me here?

1105
01:18:07,768 --> 01:18:09,770
I'm not the right person.

1106
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:15,442
You have to choose someone else.

1107
01:18:17,778 --> 01:18:20,322
Choose someone else.

1108
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,449
Please.

1109
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:42,803
No.

1110
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,987
You're a long ways
past the reef.

1111
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,365
Gramma?

1112
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:08,370
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1113
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:09,830
Gramma!

1114
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,546
I tried, Gramma.

1115
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:21,174
I couldn't do it.

1116
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:24,428
It's not your fault.

1117
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:28,348
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

1118
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,184
If you are ready to go home...

1119
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:34,688
I will be with you.

1120
01:19:51,246 --> 01:19:52,873
Why do you hesitate?

1121
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:55,959
I don't know.

1122
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:01,882
<i>I know a girl from an island</i>

1123
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:05,594
<i>She stands apart from the crowd</i>

1124
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:09,055
<i>She loves the sea and her people</i>

1125
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,725
<i>She makes her whole family proud</i>

1126
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:15,604
<i>Sometimes the world
seems against you</i>

1127
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:19,107
<i>The journey may leave a scar</i>

1128
01:20:19,274 --> 01:20:22,068
<i>But scars can heal and reveal just</i>

1129
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:24,821
<i>Where you are</i>

1130
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,742
<i>The people you love will change you</i>

1131
01:20:29,117 --> 01:20:31,995
<i>The things you have
learned will guide you</i>

1132
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:35,582
<i>And nothing on earth can silence</i>

1133
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:38,752
<i>The quiet voice still inside you</i>

1134
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:42,422
<i>And when that voice starts to whisper</i>

1135
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:45,258
<i>Moana, you've come so far</i>

1136
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:47,761
<i>Moana, listen</i>

1137
01:20:47,928 --> 01:20:52,599
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

1138
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,269
Who am I?

1139
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:01,775
<i>I am a girl who loves my island</i>

1140
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:05,737
<i>And the girl who loves the sea</i>

1141
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:09,199
<i>It calls me</i>

1142
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:14,162
<i>I am the daughter of the village chief</i>

1143
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:17,582
<i>We are descended from voyagers</i>

1144
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:20,335
<i>Who found their way across the world</i>

1145
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:22,754
<i>They call me</i>

1146
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:26,967
<i>I've delivered us to where we are</i>

1147
01:21:27,634 --> 01:21:30,303
<i>I have journeyed farther</i>

1148
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,181
<i>I am everything I've learned and more</i>

1149
01:21:33,557 --> 01:21:35,350
<i>Still it calls me</i>

1150
01:21:37,519 --> 01:21:39,813
<i>And the call isn't out there at all</i>

1151
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,774
<i>It's inside me</i>

1152
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:45,151
<i>It's like the tide</i>

1153
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:49,573
<i>Always falling and rising</i>

1154
01:21:50,031 --> 01:21:52,492
<i>I will carry you here in my heart</i>

1155
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:55,704
<i>You remind me</i>

1156
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:58,832
<i>That come what may</i>

1157
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:02,002
<i>I know the way</i>

1158
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:06,756
<i>I am Moana</i>

1159
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:43,418
<i>I am Moana of Motunui.</i>

1160
01:22:44,878 --> 01:22:45,879
<i>Aboard my boat...</i>

1161
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:48,381
<i>I will sail across the sea...</i>

1162
01:22:48,757 --> 01:22:51,718
<i>and restore the heart of Te Fiti.</i>

1163
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:29,923
Te Kā can't follow us into the water.

1164
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:32,258
We make it past the barrier islands...

1165
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:34,260
we make it to Te Fiti.

1166
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:36,096
None of which you understand...

1167
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:38,264
because you are a chicken.

1168
01:24:44,873 --> 01:24:45,874
No!

1169
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:49,586
Heihei! No, no, no!

1170
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:52,338
Nice work!

1171
01:25:01,723 --> 01:25:02,849
Te Fiti.

1172
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:29,209
Maui!

1173
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,923
You came back.

1174
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,053
But your hook.

1175
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,721
One more hit and...

1176
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:44,057
Te Kā's gotta catch me first.

1177
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:48,269
I got your back, Chosen One.

1178
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:50,730
Go save the world.

1179
01:25:50,814 --> 01:25:51,815
Maui.

1180
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:53,733
Thank you.

1181
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:55,985
You're welcome.

1182
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,279
Cheeeehoooo!

1183
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:18,174
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!

1184
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:31,104
Hey, Te Kā!

1185
01:26:31,855 --> 01:26:32,856
Shark head!

1186
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,525
Cheeeehoooo!

1187
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:46,953
Moana!

1188
01:26:57,297 --> 01:26:59,173
Get the heart to the spiral!

1189
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:39,130
Te Fiti...

1190
01:27:39,297 --> 01:27:40,715
it's gone.

1191
01:27:53,353 --> 01:27:55,021
Te Kā!

1192
01:28:30,974 --> 01:28:32,100
Let her come to me.

1193
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:59,085
<i>I have crossed the horizon to find you</i>

1194
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:08,720
<i>I know your name</i>

1195
01:29:12,515 --> 01:29:16,352
<i>They have stolen the
heart from inside you</i>

1196
01:29:21,107 --> 01:29:24,193
<i>But this does not define you</i>

1197
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:31,784
<i>This is not who you are</i>

1198
01:29:33,453 --> 01:29:38,708
<i>You know who you are</i>

1199
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:48,217
Who you truly are.

1200
01:30:11,324 --> 01:30:12,408
Te Fiti!

1201
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,367
The chicken lives.

1202
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:58,204
I'm sorry about your hook.

1203
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:01,707
Well, hook, no hook...

1204
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,793
I'm Maui.

1205
01:31:22,186 --> 01:31:24,480
Te Fiti!

1206
01:31:25,648 --> 01:31:27,483
Hey, I mean, how you been?

1207
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,239
Look, what I did was...

1208
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:34,824
wrong.

1209
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:37,034
I have no excuse.

1210
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,744
I'm sorry.

1211
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:51,257
You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

1212
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:54,260
Cheeeehoooo!

1213
01:31:56,095 --> 01:31:57,096
Thank you.

1214
01:31:57,221 --> 01:31:59,765
Your kind gesture is
deeply appreciated.

1215
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:00,933
Cheeeehoooo.

1216
01:32:49,649 --> 01:32:51,067
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1217
01:32:51,234 --> 01:32:52,318
You could come with us, you know.

1218
01:32:53,236 --> 01:32:56,822
My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.

1219
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:00,159
They already have one.

1220
01:33:18,636 --> 01:33:19,762
See you out there, Maui.

1221
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,974
See you out there, Moana.

1222
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:24,850
Cheeeehoooo!

1223
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:17,862
Mom! Dad!

1224
01:34:18,029 --> 01:34:19,196
Moana!

1225
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:31,751
I may have gone
a little ways past the reef.

1226
01:34:33,085 --> 01:34:34,712
It suits you.

1227
01:34:34,879 --> 01:34:35,921
She's back!

1228
01:34:36,088 --> 01:34:37,089
Moana!

1229
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:38,257
Pua!

1230
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:41,260
Moana!

1231
01:34:43,512 --> 01:34:44,847
Welcome home!

1232
01:35:34,772 --> 01:35:36,941
<i>We set a course to find</i>

1233
01:35:37,108 --> 01:35:41,362
<i>A brand new island
everywhere we roam</i>

1234
01:35:43,656 --> 01:35:46,033
<i>We keep our island in our mind</i>

1235
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:50,788
<i>And when it's time to find home
We know the way</i>

1236
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:55,501
<i>We are explorers reading every sign</i>

1237
01:35:56,127 --> 01:36:00,339
<i>We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain</i>

1238
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:12,601
<i>We know the way</i>

1239
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:08,905
<i>Shiny</i>

1240
01:46:09,448 --> 01:46:11,950
<i>I'm so shiny</i>

1241
01:46:12,576 --> 01:46:14,369
Didn't help me though, did it?

1242
01:46:14,536 --> 01:46:16,496
Still upside down here.

1243
01:46:16,663 --> 01:46:18,915
Just need a little push.

1244
01:46:21,084 --> 01:46:22,085
Can we be real?

1245
01:46:22,252 --> 01:46:25,630
If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...

1246
01:46:25,797 --> 01:46:27,007
you'd totally help me.

1247
01:46:27,174 --> 01:46:28,800
You would. You know you would.

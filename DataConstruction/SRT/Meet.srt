1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,963
Then I didn't choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples,

2
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:37,716
so I choosed another scary one

3
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:42,929
because, for all those years
that I went for Halloween,

4
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:44,764
I wasn't scary at all.

5
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:57,902
I love baseball.
It's my destiny to play that game.

6
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,987
I don't really care about winning.

7
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:04,575
Well, like, now I do
'cause, like, we've lost every game.

8
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,618
I've gotten tired of it.

9
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:10,247
I'm working, like, so hard.
All the balls are getting thrown to me.

10
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,791
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

11
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:17,003
All of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and...

12
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:19,755
Come on!
Let's play some baseball, okay?

13
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,216
Not the lazy game.

14
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:30,933
They're here.

15
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,898
Lewis?

16
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:41,151
Lewis?

17
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,746
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

18
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,456
They are gonna love this!

19
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:57,459
Nothing says adopt me
like a weird invention.

20
00:02:57,584 --> 00:02:58,710
Lewis!

21
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,962
Lewis, the Harringtons are here!
Way ahead of you, Mildred.

22
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:02,880
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:06,091
Remember, sit up straight.
Look them in the eye.

24
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:08,385
Smile. Let's fix your...

25
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,429
Mildred.

26
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:12,890
All right, all right, all right, all right.

27
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,892
Go show them how special you are.

28
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:16,936
Oh, I hope this is it.

29
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,771
I hope he gets adopted.

30
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,522
You and me both, chief.

31
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:24,985
I mean, there's so many things
in the world that can be improved.

32
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,446
Just think of it.
Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

33
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,114
The possibilities are endless.

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,325
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

35
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,286
All it takes is some imagination
and a little science,

36
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,789
and we can make the world
a better place.

37
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:41,209
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

38
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:43,336
So, what's your favourite sport?

39
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,963
Well, does inventing count as a sport?
Actually...

40
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:48,174
'Cause I think I hit a home run
with this one!

41
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,718
What is that?
First, a question.

42
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:53,137
What's the number one problem
that you face

43
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:54,972
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

44
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:57,390
Lewis, I don't think we...
Portion control.

45
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:59,434
Too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth,

46
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:00,643
takes forever to chew.

47
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,523
Too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky.

48
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:07,276
Well, I propose
that the perfect P.B. and J.

49
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:08,735
...is within mankind's grasp,

50
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,154
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

51
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,490
For this demonstration,
I'll use regular bread.

52
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:14,699
Honey, it's okay.

53
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,659
As you can see, toasting is an option.

54
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:18,953
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

55
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:21,956
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

56
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,832
It's jammed!

57
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,462
Lewis, please, don't!

58
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,554
What's happening?

59
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,515
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

60
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:42,350
I'm sorry!

61
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:44,019
Here let me help you get that off!

62
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:45,895
Stand back!

63
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:51,692
Is he gonna be okay?
Breathe. Breathe.

64
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:53,779
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

65
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:55,530
It was really nice to meet you.

66
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:58,449
We're gonna need some time
to think about it.

67
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:00,743
Hi, folks. Everything all...

68
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:01,953
What happened?

69
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:04,538
Miss Duffy,
that boy is definitely not right for us.

70
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:06,081
Now, if you'll excuse me.

71
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:10,169
I'm so sorry about this.
If you would just...

72
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:21,513
I made some lunch.
Not hungry.

73
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:25,016
Poor Mr Harrington.

74
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:28,687
I killed him?
No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

75
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:30,772
I called. He's perfectly fine.

76
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,233
I was just gonna say that it's...

77
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:36,027
It's too bad
he didn't get to try a sandwich

78
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:38,696
from that wonderful invention of yours.

79
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,906
Yeah, real wonderful.
It's not you.

80
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:43,534
We just haven't found
the right couple yet.

81
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,578
One hundred twenty-four.

82
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,163
What?

83
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:50,791
That's how many adoption interviews
I've had, 124.

84
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,001
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

85
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,378
You're exaggerating just to make your

86
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:57,130
point.

87
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,257
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

88
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:02,886
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted.

89
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:06,556
I have no future. No one wants me.

90
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,723
That's not true, Lewis!

91
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:09,518
My own mother didn't even want me.

92
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:12,020
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

93
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:13,521
Then why'd she give me up?

94
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:15,315
She may not have been able
to take care of you.

95
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,941
Did you ever think of that?

96
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,862
I am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you.

97
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:23,989
I never thought of it that way.

98
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:27,409
Maybe she wanted to keep you,
but she had no choice.

99
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:30,287
You're right.

100
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,083
My real mom is the only person
who's ever wanted me.

101
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,960
Wait. I said maybe.

102
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:38,879
And if she wanted me then,
she'll want me now.

103
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:40,464
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:43,967
I have to find her, Mildred,
and when I do, she'll take me back,

105
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:45,468
and we'll be a family again!

106
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:49,388
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lewis, you can't do that.

107
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:52,266
No one knows anything about her.
No one even saw her.

108
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,145
Wrong. I saw her

109
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,354
once.

110
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:01,109
She's in here. I just have to remember.

111
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,197
That's it!

112
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,034
 Hello 

113
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,995
 I got something to tell you 

114
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,582
 But it's crazy 

115
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:21,169
 I got something to show you 

116
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:24,714
 So give me just one more chance 

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,968
 One more glance 
 And I will make of you 

118
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:32,597
 Another believer 

119
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:37,810
 Guess what? 
 You got more than you bargained 

120
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,979
 Ain't it crazy? 

121
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:44,733
 You got more than you paid for 

122
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:48,153
 So give me just one more chance 

123
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:50,864
 One more glance 

124
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,952
 One more hand to hold 

125
00:07:56,161 --> 00:08:02,959
 You've been on my mind 

126
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:06,587
 Though it may seem I'm fooling 

127
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:13,260
 Wasted so much time 

128
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:17,974
 Though it may seem I'm fooling 

129
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,476
 What are we gonna do? 

130
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,312
 What are we gonna do? 

131
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:27,316
 What are we gonna do about it? 

132
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:34,113
 You've been on my mind 

133
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:37,658
 One more chance 

134
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:42,998
 Wasted so much time 

135
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,460
 One more chance 

136
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:50,755
So tired.

137
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:56,135
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon.
He'll be so excited you're coming.

138
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,553
Bye-bye, now.

139
00:08:57,678 --> 00:09:01,264
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

140
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,433
Good luck at the big game today.
Easy win.

141
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:05,602
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

142
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:07,813
I just hope I can stay awake.

143
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,815
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

144
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,693
He was up all night
working on his stupid project,

145
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:15,528
but that's what happens

146
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:18,907
when you get a science geek
for a roommate.

147
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,206
Ah, that's good joe.

148
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:31,586
All right, Einstein,
you owe Michael big time.

149
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:34,714
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than I expected,

150
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,925
but it's finished, Mildred.
I recalibrated the headset.

151
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,719
Now the neural circuits will connect.

152
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:42,721
I've cracked the hippocampus!

153
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:44,723
Really? Okay. What?

154
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,641
Now to test it out.

155
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,479
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

156
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:52,688
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

157
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:54,482
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

158
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:55,983
I know you have a lot
on your plate today,

159
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:58,403
but I've scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon.

160
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:00,405
No, thanks.
No, thanks?

161
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,407
Sweetheart, this is
about being adopted,

162
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:05,535
and you will be back here
clean, happy and on time.

163
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,455
I'm done with interviews, Mildred.
I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

164
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,874
Listen, I know where your head is,
but I'm telling you,

165
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:15,711
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future.

166
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:17,754
I am, and this is it.

167
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,089
This is my future.

168
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:21,674
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,178
Lewis? Honey?

170
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:31,268
Dr Krunklehorn,
I know you're very busy there

171
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:32,477
at Inventco Labs,

172
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:34,562
and we're just so excited
to have you as a judge.

173
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:36,606
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein.
Hey, you never know.

174
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:38,774
One of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit

175
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,943
or microprocessor or integrated circuit.

176
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,486
Oh, wait! I said that already.

177
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,405
Well, I just don't get out
of that lab very much.

178
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,532
Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.

179
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,618
I haven't slept in eight days!

180
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:51,454
Well, then can I get you a cot
or something?

181
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,582
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch.
It's my invention.

182
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:57,334
Each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

183
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,878
You can stay awake for days
with no side effects.

184
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,088
Sorry. Who's this?

185
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:04,841
This is one of our students,
Stanley Pukowski.

186
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:06,593
Oh, so cute!

187
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:09,095
I just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks!

188
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,517
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

189
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:16,186
It's actually a toga, sir.

190
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:19,772
Coach, nice to see you, sort of.
What are you doing here?

191
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:22,358
Judging a science fair.
What's it look like I'm doing?

192
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,486
And what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair?

193
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:26,862
It's my gym.

194
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:29,448
Stanley. Volcano.

195
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:35,078
Behold the awesome power
of Mount Vesuvius!

196
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:41,251
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

197
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,461
Dr Krunklehorn?

198
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,588
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

199
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:48,675
I don't know what she just said,
but this project is unacceptable!

200
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,510
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

201
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:52,136
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

202
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,971
Coach!
I'm watching you.

203
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:06,484
Okay, next up is Lizzy
and her fire ant farm.

204
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:07,777
That's right.

205
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:09,361
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

206
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:11,322
You know that they have a tendency
to bite people.

207
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,699
Only my enemies.

208
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,077
Just keep moving, shall we?
Top notch, Lizzy!

209
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,954
Let's not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way.

210
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,595
This area's not secure. Get in.

211
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:39,348
Have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat?

212
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:41,684
What?
Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

213
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:44,311
Okay, goodbye.
All right,

214
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:46,480
didn't want to pull rank on you,
but you forced my hand.

215
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,774
Special Agent Wilbur Robinson
of the T.C.T.F.

216
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,942
The what?
Time Continuum Task Force.

217
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,193
I'm here to protect you.
Well...

218
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,738
Now, tall man, bowler hat,
approached you?

219
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:55,948
No, why?

220
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,450
I could lose my badge for this.

221
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,285
He's a suspect in a robbery.

222
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,495
What did he steal?

223
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,913
A time machine.
A what?

224
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:06,166
I've tracked him to this time,
and my informants say he's after you.

225
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,959
Me? Why me?

226
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:10,044
The boys back at HQ
haven't figured out a motive yet.

227
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,129
And by HQ, I mean headquarters.

228
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:13,589
I know what HQ means.

229
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:15,257
Good. You're a smart kid.

230
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,426
That might keep you alive, for now.

231
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:19,094
Just worry
about your little science gizmo

232
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:21,347
and leave the perp to me.

233
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:24,225
And by perp, I mean...
I know what it means!

234
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,352
Okay, Mr Smarty-pants.

235
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,065
Bowler Hat Guy!

236
00:13:35,694 --> 00:13:37,028
My frogs!

237
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,404
You're not gonna get away with it,

238
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:42,200
kid with science project.

239
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:44,953
Dude, you almost busted
my solar system!

240
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:48,748
My frogs! They're getting away!

241
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:22,280
Got you! That's the last of them.

242
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:24,741
Annoying little girl,
I don't have time for this.

243
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:25,950
I'm on a very important...

244
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,286
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

245
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,456
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain!
Love the pain!

246
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,707
Coach...

247
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:34,958
Next up is Lewis.

248
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,253
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

249
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,755
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

250
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:44,468
It's okay. It's gonna work this time.
I won't let you down, I promise.

251
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,512
All right, Lewis, I trust you.
Knock 'em dead.

252
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,974
That was a figure of speech.
Please don't kill anyone.

253
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,313
Okay, stand back, everybody.

254
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,107
This next project
will knock your socks off.

255
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,944
Seriously, you might wanna stand back
a little.

256
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,197
Have you ever forgotten something,

257
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,826
and no matter how hard you tried,
you couldn't remember it?

258
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,871
Well, what happens
to these forgotten memories?

259
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,458
I propose
they're stored somewhere in your brain,

260
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,168
and I built a machine
that can retrieve them.

261
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:23,213
I call it the Memory Scanner.

262
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,465
It's shiny!

263
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,260
So, Lewis,
how does the Memory Scanner work?

264
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,763
First, you input the desired period
of time on this keypad.

265
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,226
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex,
where memories are stored.

266
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,811
The retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor.

267
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,855
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

268
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,567
Now, I'm going back 12 years,
three months and 11 days.

269
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:46,569
Why that particular day?

270
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:48,654
You didn't think
I was paying attention, did you?

271
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:52,450
Well, that was the day...

272
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:56,579
Let's just say, that was
a very important day in my life.

273
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,247
Fair enough. Play ball.

274
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,917
It'll just take a second
to get the turbines going.

275
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:22,103
Lewis, wait!

276
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:34,907
She's gonna blow!

277
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:38,034
Watch out!

278
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:44,124
Feel the pain! Love the...

279
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,293
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

280
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,466
Make it stop!

281
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:54,926
Coach, suck it up, okay?

282
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:58,471
Let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

283
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:00,389
Let's calm down!
Mr Willerstein?

284
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:02,099
I didn't mean to...
Not now, Lewis!

285
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:04,852
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

286
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:06,478
Not now.

287
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:10,650
Okay, and we are walking
in a calm, orderly fashion

288
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:11,859
toward the exits.

289
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:17,906
Wait, Lewis!

290
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:39,385
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

291
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:03,299
Hey, what are you doing up here?

292
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:21,024
Would you quit that, please?
I know you're not a pigeon.

293
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:23,568
You're blowing my cover.

294
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:25,278
We're the only ones up here.

295
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:27,363
That's just what they want you to think.

296
00:19:27,488 --> 00:19:29,073
Now, enough moping.

297
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:32,118
Take this back to the science fair
and fix that Memory Scanner.

298
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:34,119
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

299
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:35,287
Maybe you've forgotten.

300
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:37,956
I'm a time cop from the future,
should be taken very seriously.

301
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:40,209
That's no badge.

302
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:43,629
This is a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.

303
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:45,798
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

304
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,883
but I really am from the future,

305
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,968
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

306
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:51,303
Here we go again.

307
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:53,346
He stole a time machine,
came to the science fair

308
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:54,556
and ruined your project.

309
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,975
My project didn't work
because I'm no good.

310
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,602
There is no Bowler Hat Guy,
there is no time machine,

311
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:01,312
and you're not from the future!

312
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:02,480
You're crazy!

313
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:04,398
I am not crazy.

314
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:06,860
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel?
Prove it.

315
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:10,321
Yeah, that's what I thought.

316
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:13,282
I'm just gonna go lock myself
in my room

317
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:15,326
and hide under the covers
for a couple years.

318
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:18,787
If I prove to you I'm from the future,
will you go back to the science fair?

319
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:21,123
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

320
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:23,166
Hey, let go of me!

321
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:25,335
What are you doing? Let go of me!
Okay.

322
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:47,732
What is this? Where are we going?

323
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:50,192
To the future!

324
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:12,839
 The future has arrived 

325
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,592
 The future has arrived today 

326
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:19,053
 The future has arrived 

327
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:22,933
 The future has arrived today 

328
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:05,347
Is this proof enough for you?

329
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:07,057
Is it ever!

330
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:10,185
I never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime,

331
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,730
and here it is, right in front of me!

332
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,607
The truth will set you free, brother.

333
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,610
This is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

334
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,612
This means
I could really change my life.

335
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:22,114
That's right. You can.

336
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:24,574
Next stop, science fair,
to fix your Memory Scanner.

337
00:22:24,699 --> 00:22:27,452
Hey, I'm not gonna fix
that stupid Memory Scanner.

338
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:31,122
What?
Wilbur, this is a time machine!

339
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:32,957
Why should I fix my dumb invention

340
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:36,502
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship?

341
00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:42,300
I could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up.

342
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:45,261
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.

343
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:47,722
This? You want to know
what I think about this?

344
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:48,973
What are you doing?

345
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,266
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

346
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:52,226
but you don't know
what I've lived through.

347
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:54,144
Lewis, no!
Let go!

348
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,146
You let go!
You're not the boss of me!

349
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:59,441
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

350
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:00,942
That makes me older.

351
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:02,151
Well, I was born in the past,

352
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:04,321
which makes me older
and the boss of you!

353
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:24,339
I am so dead.

354
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,636
I'm not allowed to look at this thing,
let alone drive it!

355
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:30,137
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

356
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:33,015
and I can tell you this.
It will not be done with mercy.

357
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,808
Isn't there like
a time machine repair shop

358
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:35,976
or something?
No!

359
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:38,186
There's only two time machines
in existence,

360
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:40,105
and the Bowler Hat Guy
has the other one!

361
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,691
Well, somebody's gonna have
to fix this.

362
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,860
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

363
00:23:45,985 --> 00:23:48,404
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

364
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,073
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

365
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:54,369
All right, under one condition.

366
00:23:54,744 --> 00:23:57,455
I fix it,
you take me back to see my mom.

367
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,500
What? You didn't even follow through
on our last deal.

368
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,709
How can I trust you?

369
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:04,545
Well, you told me you were a time cop
from the future.

370
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,380
How can I trust you?

371
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:08,215
Touché.

372
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:11,885
So do we have a deal?

373
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,042
Good day, madam.

374
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:48,629
I'm here to change the future.
Yes, sir?

375
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:52,591
I must speak with the man
in charge immediately.

376
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:55,969
Yes, sir.
I have an appointment with destiny.

377
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,762
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

378
00:24:57,888 --> 00:25:00,098
and I'll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite.

379
00:25:00,223 --> 00:25:02,267
What?
Now, what time is your appointment?

380
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:06,270
Are you talking to me?
Yes.

381
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,064
What time is your appointment?

382
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:13,528
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

383
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:15,279
You're the 2:00?

384
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:17,448
Yes. Yes, I am.

385
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:19,325
You're Mary Johnson?

386
00:25:19,742 --> 00:25:21,785
Yes.

387
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,538
Mary is short for...

388
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:26,623
Marian?

389
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:29,626
Can that be a boy name?
Yes.

390
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:32,253
Then yes.
Have a seat.

391
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:33,755
Oh, goody!

392
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:48,478
Pass off invention as my own. Check.
Oh, I love checklists.

393
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:50,229
The board is ready to see you now.

394
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:53,691
Wait. What am I going to say?

395
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,693
I'm never gonna remember that.

396
00:25:56,944 --> 00:26:00,198
Would you... Why don't you go?
You do it so much better than me.

397
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:02,533
That's true.

398
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:05,327
A hat without a head
couldn't really pass off an invention

399
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:06,537
as its own.

400
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:11,917
Fantastic! Great idea!
I'm so glad I have you!

401
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:21,676
Prepare to be amazed. Oh, I got it!

402
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:25,680
Prepare to be amazed!

403
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:30,851
This is my invention.

404
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:35,022
I doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device.

405
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:36,190
Very well,

406
00:26:36,774 --> 00:26:38,525
Miss Johnson?

407
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:40,569
It's Ms.

408
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:43,280
You have two minutes. Please begin.

409
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:50,287
It's shiny!
What is that thing?

410
00:26:50,412 --> 00:26:54,957
Well, I like to call it my...

411
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,960
To call it my...

412
00:26:57,085 --> 00:27:01,256
What are you looking at?
No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

413
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:03,174
Well, then let me close the blinds.

414
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:10,889
Now, the name?

415
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:12,975
Well, what...

416
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,768
We can quibble about names
at a later date.

417
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,647
The point is,
what I have here is special, unique.

418
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:21,108
Yes. Yes, you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it,

419
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:25,112
and the best part is,
it's got really comfy headphones.

420
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:32,494
I wonder, could you lean forward
just a little bit, please?

421
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,412
Yes, thank you.

422
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:37,165
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

423
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:39,709
What do you hope
to accomplish with this?

424
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,461
Oh, nothing of consequence.

425
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:46,341
I simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy!

426
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:49,969
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

427
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:51,804
You mean,
you haven't thought this through?

428
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:54,098
Thirty seconds.

429
00:27:58,935 --> 00:28:00,479
Allow me to show you how it works.

430
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:02,647
First, we turn it on.

431
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,611
That's not it.

432
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,572
Ten seconds.

433
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,676
So where do I sign?

434
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,982
Doris, it's all over.

435
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,068
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

436
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:50,905
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing.

437
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:52,865
You're right.

438
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,743
Success is still ours for the taking.

439
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,082
We must find that boy.

440
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:08,588
We'll sneak this thing into the garage.
You'll have all the tools you need.

441
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:09,756
What about your parents?

442
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,007
Mom never goes in there,

443
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:13,218
and Dad's on a business trip
until tomorrow morning.

444
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:14,385
You've got till then to fix it.

445
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:17,680
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need
some blueprints or something for this.

446
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:20,141
No worries. I got someone
who could help us with that.

447
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:26,105
Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?

448
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,274
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

449
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,569
None may enter
unless they speak the royal password.

450
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:34,113
Carl, what are you talking about?
We don't have a password.

451
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:37,533
Yes, we do.
I made one up while you were gone.

452
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:39,785
Well, then
how am I supposed to know what it is?

453
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,244
You...

454
00:29:42,495 --> 00:29:44,039
Good point.

455
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,127
Welcome back, little buddy.

456
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:50,796
So what's up
with the stolen time machine?

457
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:53,465
Did you find it? Apparently not,

458
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,217
and you managed
to bust this one as well.

459
00:29:56,343 --> 00:29:57,886
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

460
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:00,555
And how do you suppose
that's gonna...

461
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,723
Who's that?
Wow, a real robot!

462
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:03,975
Hi, I'm Lewis.

463
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:12,482
Well, that was unexpected.

464
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:14,652
As was that.

465
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:17,279
If my family finds out
I brought you from the past,

466
00:30:17,404 --> 00:30:19,490
they'll bury me alive
and dance on my grave.

467
00:30:19,615 --> 00:30:22,659
I'm not exaggerating.
Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

468
00:30:22,784 --> 00:30:24,995
The point is,
your hair's a dead giveaway.

469
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,830
Why would my hair be
a dead giveaway?

470
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,665
That is an excellent question.

471
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,250
Wait! Where are you going?

472
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,834
Another excellent question.

473
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:35,296
But I don't just want to sit here.

474
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:36,839
Stay.

475
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:38,174
But...

476
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:55,107
Wow!

477
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:02,530
Hey, ring my doorbell.

478
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:04,033
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

479
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:06,243
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it.
Look at this door bell. Ring it.

480
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:10,372
Yes!
That was accidental.

481
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:11,956
That's an accidental ring.
It doesn't count.

482
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:13,208
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

483
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,792
Flat head.
Short roots.

484
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:15,960
Evergreen.

485
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:23,467
What do you mean,
don't go to the family?

486
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:27,304
How can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis?

487
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:31,100
By leaving the garage door unlocked,
you let the time machine get stolen,

488
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:34,103
and now the entire time stream
could be altered!

489
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:35,896
That and someone took my bike.

490
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,732
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

491
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,610
First, we keep Lewis in the garage,
away from everybody.

492
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,653
I show up and give him
the pep talk of the century.

493
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,238
Then he fixes the time machine.

494
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,115
Why is it an acorn?

495
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,950
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

496
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,077
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

497
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:52,787
His confidence in inventing is restored.

498
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:55,373
He goes back to the science fair,
fixes his Memory Scanner,

499
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,417
thus restoring
the space-time continuum.

500
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,294
What about taking him back
to see his mom?

501
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,254
I just told him that to buy some time.

502
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:04,715
Oh, yeah, can't see that one
blowing up in your face.

503
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,592
Trust me. I got it under control.

504
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,802
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

505
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,806
But on the slight chance that I do...

506
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,101
On the slight chance, yeah.
You know what? I'll run the numbers.

507
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,106
What is it?

508
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,941
Well, it's not...

509
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:28,154
It doesn't pertain to anything in...
You know, there's not necessarily...

510
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,117
There's a 99.999999% chance
that you won't exist.

511
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,620
What?
And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

512
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,122
I won't exist?

513
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,748
And where does that leave me?

514
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:42,167
Alone, rusting in a corner.

515
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:47,131
What am I worried about?
Now, blueprints?

516
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,221
If this thing ever blows over,
I really gotta get away from you

517
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:55,639
and get some quiet time.

518
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:00,185
What's...

519
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,562
Well, hey, there, little fella!

520
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:06,399
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and my clothes are not on backwards.

521
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:08,067
My head is!

522
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:12,364
Oh, I used to tell that one
to my science students.

523
00:33:13,364 --> 00:33:14,991
They didn't laugh, either.

524
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:17,160
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

525
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,328
Well, Lewis, but...
Lewis, huh?

526
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:22,540
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen
any teeth around here, have you?

527
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:24,291
Teeth?
Yeah, my teeth.

528
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:28,003
Been digging holes all day.
Can't find them anywhere.

529
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:30,255
All right, look, old man,
I need to get back to the garage.

530
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,464
Wilbur left me down there,

531
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:32,882
and I wasn't supposed to leave,
and these monsters...

532
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:34,050
Monsters?
...attacked me on the porch and...

533
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:36,053
There's no monsters on the porch,
you ninny.

534
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:37,721
Listen to me!
Of course, I also didn't think

535
00:33:37,846 --> 00:33:39,473
there was a woodchuck
living on my arm,

536
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:41,057
and lookie there!

537
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:42,225
Hope he ain't got rabies.

538
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,519
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

539
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:48,523
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy.
I know a shortcut.

540
00:33:48,648 --> 00:33:50,608
Welcome to the garage.

541
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:52,777
Well, I'm completely lost.

542
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:53,986
Hiya, Grandpa.

543
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:55,195
Hey, Aunt Billie.

544
00:33:55,321 --> 00:33:56,864
Lewis and me
are looking for the garage.

545
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:59,241
We have a garage?
Apparently so.

546
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:01,702
Lewis, will you give me a hand
and time my race?

547
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:05,706
Okay, Gaston,
my toy train's ready for you.

548
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:09,042
That's a toy train?

549
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:15,131
On your mark, get set, go?

550
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:21,179
3.7 seconds.
I win!

551
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:24,807
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

552
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,227
Lewis?

553
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:30,355
And five and six and seven and eight.
That's Uncle Joe. He works out.

554
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,522
Keep those tummies tucked.

555
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:34,734
This isn't the garage.

556
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:35,901
I know.

557
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:38,404
I don't think
the garage is in here, either.

558
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:41,198
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

559
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:43,867
That's Uncle Art.
A real superhero?

560
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:45,911
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

561
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:48,329
needs a large
cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?

562
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:51,834
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

563
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:54,628
He's a...
Pizza delivery guy.

564
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:56,088
Lewis?

565
00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:59,215
What are we doing up here?
Looking for the garage.

566
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:01,050
Oh, yeah!

567
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:11,727
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat,
or I'm telling Ma!

568
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:14,146
Lighten up, sis!
Lasz, I mean it!

569
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,608
Children, please!
Your mother is trying to take a nap.

570
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,694
What is all the yelling out here?

571
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:20,986
He started it!
She started it!

572
00:35:21,112 --> 00:35:22,446
I don't want to hear any more!

573
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:26,033
Now, sweetie...
Don't you sweetie me!

574
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:28,452
I'm going for a drive!

575
00:35:32,122 --> 00:35:34,666
That's strange.
She usually takes the Harley.

576
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,584
Lewis!

577
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,378
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.

578
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,091
Bake them cookies, Lucille!

579
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:44,551
Why is your dog wearing glasses?

580
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,762
Oh, 'cause his insurance
won't pay for contacts.

581
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:50,598
That's Uncle Spike,
and there's Uncle Dimitri.

582
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:54,143
Oh, look, there's...
That's the monster!

583
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:57,146
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.

584
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:59,731
Nice to meet you.

585
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:02,150
Hey, Lefty,
any idea how to get to the garage?

586
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:05,653
Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.

587
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:07,865
Who?
Wilbur's mom, Franny.

588
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,658
I think you'll like her.

589
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,246
Hey, guys!

590
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:19,792
 You ask me over 
 And over and over 

591
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:23,004
 Have you seen 
 My peacock-feathered hat? 

592
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:24,296
Frogs?

593
00:36:24,422 --> 00:36:25,923
Taught them everything they know.

594
00:36:26,048 --> 00:36:29,009
Franny, this is Lewis.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

595
00:36:29,134 --> 00:36:32,679
Perfect timing.
We need someone on maracas.

596
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:37,143
 Where is your heart at? 
 Nobody knows that 

597
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:39,353
 Even though you've him, her, me 

598
00:36:39,478 --> 00:36:42,064
 And an army searching 

599
00:36:44,107 --> 00:36:47,777
 I've got a feeling 
 You will be reeling 

600
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:51,489
 When you are bad 
 And the circus comes to town 

601
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:53,324
Grandpa, I think I found your teeth.

602
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:55,242
 And you see me leaving 
 Dressed up as a magician 

603
00:36:55,368 --> 00:36:56,494
 Or something like that 

604
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:00,874
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!

605
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:02,417
Ring-a-ding-ding.

606
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,423
All right!

607
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:12,676
Right. Well, glad I could help
with the teeth,

608
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:15,220
but, wow, look at the time.

609
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:19,724
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!

610
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:21,976
I did, but I went up the tube,
and I ran into your family, and I...

611
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:24,605
You met my family?

612
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:28,608
Pop quiz.

613
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,193
Who have you met,
and what have you learnt?

614
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:32,320
Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.

615
00:37:32,445 --> 00:37:34,822
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...

616
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,157
Cranky? Yes.

617
00:37:36,282 --> 00:37:37,700
Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.

618
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:39,785
Joe is married to Billie.
Lefty is the butler.

619
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,036
Spike and Dimitri are twins,

620
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:42,955
and I don't know who they're related to.

621
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,164
Neither do we. Go on.

622
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:47,709
Lucille is married to Bud,
and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.

623
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:50,337
What does Cornelius look like?

624
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:51,756
Tom Selleck.

625
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,969
Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny,
and her brothers are Gaston and Art.

626
00:37:57,094 --> 00:37:58,303
You're forgetting something.

627
00:37:58,428 --> 00:37:59,638
Forgetting? Oh, right.

628
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:02,224
Wilbur is the son
of Franny and Cornelius.

629
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,975
And nobody realised
you were from the past?

630
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,143
Nope.

631
00:38:05,643 --> 00:38:06,769
Thank you. Thank you.

632
00:38:06,894 --> 00:38:10,314
Hold your applause.
Thank you very much.

633
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:25,538
Doris, get it off! Get it off!

634
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:34,087
I've got you now.

635
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,630
Lewis!

636
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:41,345
No, Lewis is my stupid roommate.

637
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,848
My name's Mike Yagoobian.
People call me Goob,

638
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:48,518
but today, everyone that beat me up
called me puke face

639
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:51,354
and butterfingers
and booger breath.

640
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,398
Nice to see that they're branching out.

641
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:57,067
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

642
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:59,278
Well, I was just looking for Lewis.

643
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,364
Try the roof.
He's always up there being dumb.

644
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:05,618
Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

645
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,038
Mr Steak, you're my only friend.

646
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:13,083
Game didn't go so well, huh?

647
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:17,712
No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning,
and I missed the winning catch.

648
00:39:18,004 --> 00:39:19,631
Then I got beat up.

649
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:23,968
Afterwards, Coach took me aside
and told me to let it go.

650
00:39:24,218 --> 00:39:26,137
I don't know. He's probably right.

651
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:27,388
No!

652
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:30,517
Everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on, but don't.

653
00:39:30,642 --> 00:39:34,687
Instead, let it fester
and boil inside of you.

654
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:36,647
Take these feelings
and lock them away.

655
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,399
Let them fuel your actions.

656
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:40,568
Let hate be your ally,

657
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:44,405
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things.

658
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:50,744
Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.

659
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:55,248
What?

660
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,590
Where is that boy?

661
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:08,970
Good idea!
Separate and look for clues.

662
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,268
Look, my dear! Look what I found!
It's a stick.

663
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,645
Now, what did you find?

664
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:22,483
Yes. Yes, I see.

665
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:25,736
Time travel residue next to DNA
from Wilbur Robinson.

666
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:29,198
That plus my stick must mean...

667
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:42,460
To the future! Shotgun!

668
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:51,803
I don't even know what I'm doing.

669
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:52,970
Keep moving forward.

670
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:55,139
I mean,
this stuff is way too advanced for me.

671
00:40:55,264 --> 00:40:56,348
Keep moving forward.

672
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:58,559
And what if I can't fix this?
What are we gonna do?

673
00:40:58,684 --> 00:40:59,810
Keep moving forward.

674
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:01,436
Why do you keep saying that?

675
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:03,522
And don't just say,
Keep moving forward.

676
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:04,981
It's my dad's motto.

677
00:41:05,107 --> 00:41:07,067
Why would his motto be
keep moving forward?

678
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:08,526
It's what he does.

679
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:10,320
What's that supposed to mean?

680
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:12,322
That is an excellent question.

681
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:13,824
Robinson Industries,

682
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:16,660
the world's leading
scientific-research-and-design factory.

683
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:19,579
My dad runs the company.
They mass produce his inventions.

684
00:41:19,704 --> 00:41:23,874
His motto, Keep moving forward.
It's what he does.

685
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,710
What has he invented?
Everything.

686
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,712
Carl, the time machine,
the travel tubes.

687
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:30,589
Your dad invented the time machine?

688
00:41:30,714 --> 00:41:32,174
Yep. Five years ago,

689
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:34,468
Dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat.

690
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:37,513
He wants to build a time machine,
so he starts working.

691
00:41:37,638 --> 00:41:40,057
We're talking plans.
We're talking scale models.

692
00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:41,851
We're talking prototypes.

693
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:43,352
That's a prototype?

694
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:46,688
The very first, or what's left of it.
Yikes.

695
00:41:46,813 --> 00:41:49,024
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.

696
00:41:49,149 --> 00:41:51,026
Prototypes two and three,
not much better.

697
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:52,402
Number six, 58,

698
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:53,945
212, 485,

699
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,196
952,

700
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,573
and they all end the same way.

701
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,537
But he doesn't give up.

702
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,291
Dude, I can't take you seriously
in that hat.

703
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:09,669
He keeps working and working
until finally he gets it,

704
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,379
the first working time machine.

705
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:14,840
Then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again,

706
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,050
the second working time machine.

707
00:42:16,175 --> 00:42:17,384
Kind of small.

708
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:19,636
I'm assuming that's a joke.
I'm ignoring you for time reasons.

709
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:21,221
This, my friend, is merely a model

710
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:24,265
because, unfortunately,
time machine number two

711
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:27,978
is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.

712
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,237
Pretty amazing story, huh?
Yeah.

713
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:39,822
Now, are you ready to start working?

714
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:56,380
I think that's it. I did it!

715
00:42:56,505 --> 00:42:57,923
I knew you could.

716
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:03,595
Nice work, my friend.

717
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:17,650
Well, you know what they say!
Keep moving...

718
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:19,319
Don't say it!

719
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,201
Boys! Dinner time!

720
00:43:27,326 --> 00:43:28,494
Not now, Mom!

721
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,247
If you aren't up here in five minutes,
I'm gonna come down and get you!

722
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,209
We'd better get up there.

723
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,298
Let's get that boy!

724
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:44,426
Sit here?

725
00:43:44,551 --> 00:43:46,220
But I want to look, too.

726
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:50,098
A mini-Doris!

727
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:53,434
I didn't even know you could do that.
It's so cute.

728
00:43:54,352 --> 00:43:56,396
Let's take her out for a spin.

729
00:43:57,813 --> 00:43:59,273
Sorry.

730
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:01,901
Teamwork.

731
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:06,113
Sorry.

732
00:44:07,656 --> 00:44:08,824
Sorry!

733
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,831
There you are.

734
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:19,584
Now, to lure him out of the house.

735
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:25,048
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes!
Yes, and... No.

736
00:44:25,465 --> 00:44:28,342
No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.

737
00:44:29,218 --> 00:44:30,344
Oh! I know!

738
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:34,348
I'll turn him into a duck!
Yes! Yes, it's so evil!

739
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:37,602
I don't know how to do that.

740
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:40,521
I don't really need a duck.

741
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:45,067
This may be harder than I thought.

742
00:44:48,654 --> 00:44:49,780
Hey, ring my doorbell.

743
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:51,698
No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.

744
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,575
That doorbell will give you a rash.

745
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:56,619
Yes! I'm two for two, man.

746
00:44:56,744 --> 00:44:58,329
If they don't do it on purpose,
it doesn't count.

747
00:44:58,454 --> 00:45:00,624
Come on. Read your rule book.
You know what?

748
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:02,542
You can take your rule book
and shove it right...

749
00:45:03,543 --> 00:45:06,129
 I don't believe in fretting or grieving 

750
00:45:06,254 --> 00:45:08,339
 Why mess around with strife? 

751
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,301
 Guess I was cut out 
 To step out and strut out 

752
00:45:12,427 --> 00:45:13,719
 Give me the simple life 

753
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:17,765
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

754
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,434
Dinner is served.

755
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:21,602
Dinner is served.

756
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,148
Hooray! Italian food.

757
00:45:26,274 --> 00:45:27,692
I want a sloppy joe!

758
00:45:27,817 --> 00:45:30,069
Oh, Billie,
could you please pass the gravy?

759
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,403
Coming to you, big girl.

760
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:35,240
Reminds me of the time
my meatball pizza staved off civil war

761
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,242
on the black moon of Keward.

762
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:40,078
Where's my sloppy joe?

763
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:41,621
Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.

764
00:45:41,746 --> 00:45:43,998
We gotta talk.
How about some gravy? Over here.

765
00:45:44,123 --> 00:45:46,876
Why is the kid still here?
Any of this ring a bell?

766
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:50,755
Science fair, Memory Scanner,
a time stream that needs fixing?

767
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,965
Temporary setback.

768
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,883
He's just having
a little confidence issue.

769
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:55,093
You want me to talk to him?
No.

770
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:56,594
I give a mean back rub.
No.

771
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:57,762
Shiatsu?
No.

772
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,013
Feng shui.
No.

773
00:45:59,138 --> 00:46:00,431
I've got it under control.

774
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:04,059
So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?

775
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:05,269
No.
Yes.

776
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:06,478
Yes.
No.

777
00:46:06,645 --> 00:46:07,979
Well, yes and no.

778
00:46:08,105 --> 00:46:10,899
Lewis is a new transfer student.

779
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:12,275
Yeah.

780
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,902
Where are you from, Lewis?
Canada?

781
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:18,532
I think you mean North Montana.
Hasn't been called Canada in years.

782
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:21,368
Do you know Sam Gundersen?

783
00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:23,953
It's a big country.
State.

784
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,831
I wonder if you're related.
Maybe if he took his hat off.

785
00:46:26,956 --> 00:46:28,249
Oh, good idea.

786
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:30,876
Then we can see
if he has the family cowlick.

787
00:46:31,002 --> 00:46:34,338
He can't,
because he's got bad hat-hair.

788
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:35,964
Oh, nonsense.

789
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,009
A North Montana man doesn't care
about hat-hair.

790
00:46:39,134 --> 00:46:40,469
Let's see the cowlick!

791
00:46:40,594 --> 00:46:42,013
All right, everyone, hold your horses.

792
00:46:42,138 --> 00:46:43,347
Lewis, do you mind?

793
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:45,808
I'm afraid
this isn't gonna stop otherwise.

794
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:47,351
But... But...
And so it begins.

795
00:46:47,476 --> 00:46:48,560
Now, don't be shy.

796
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:51,188
We're all family here.
Ready, aim, fire!

797
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:58,987
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

798
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:03,991
Impressive, little sister.

799
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:06,786
Your skills are strong,
but not strong enough.

800
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:09,205
Your words
do not threaten me, brother.

801
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,875
Then enough words.
Now the real battle begins.

802
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,387
Your meatballs are useless against me.

803
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:29,098
Then perhaps it's time
for spicy Italian sausage!

804
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:30,391
No!

805
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:42,362
That's right. I did it.

806
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:44,072
Is dinner like this every night?

807
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:45,990
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

808
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,914
Okay, gang,
time for the second course.

809
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:58,377
And what goes better with meatballs
than P.B. and J?

810
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:01,505
Hey, that's just like...

811
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:06,843
Stupid...

812
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:08,136
Carl?

813
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:09,304
Is everything all right?

814
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:13,016
We're just experiencing bugs.

815
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,436
Just what the doctor ordered.

816
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,438
My friend Lewis is an inventor.
He can fix it.

817
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,106
Wilbur, you know I can't.

818
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,984
Come on. Give it a try.

819
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,737
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

820
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:28,489
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

821
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,492
We're past the point of no return!

822
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,786
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

823
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,621
We all pay!

824
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,289
I don't know.

825
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,458
You would really be
helping us out, Lewis.

826
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,750
Please.

827
00:48:45,004 --> 00:48:47,173
One dragonfly on the rocks, please,
Mr Barkeep.

828
00:48:47,298 --> 00:48:50,552
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby,
you gotta tell us one of your jokes.

829
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,430
Yeah, Frankie.
How about that one with the bullfrog?

830
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,390
All right, you bozos.

831
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:58,309
Have to get that boy out of the house.

832
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:01,229
Sorry. Wait!

833
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:03,606
So I turn to the bullfrog,
and you know what I says?

834
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:06,984
Talking frogs
with their own little outdoor bar,

835
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:09,820
and so smartly dressed! Perfect!

836
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:12,406
I says,
Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't.

837
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:15,993
Frankie, you're a riot.
I gotta go pee!

838
00:49:16,118 --> 00:49:17,661
I love it.
You bunch of goons.

839
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:29,339
That's a good buzz. What the...

840
00:49:29,714 --> 00:49:33,050
Yes! You are now under my control.

841
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:35,261
I am now under your control.

842
00:49:38,013 --> 00:49:39,849
Stop laughing.
Stop laughing.

843
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:42,894
Don't repeat everything I say.
I won't repeat everything you say.

844
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,854
Excellent.
Excellent.

845
00:49:45,146 --> 00:49:47,857
Did you just say, Excellent,
because I said, Excellent?

846
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:50,442
No.

847
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,778
Excellent.
Excellent.

848
00:49:53,946 --> 00:49:57,616
So, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking?
Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.

849
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,743
I've recalibrated
the dispensing conduits

850
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:02,078
and aligned
the ejection mechanism and...

851
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:05,874
There he is,
that repulsive, half-witted fool!

852
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:07,834
Now, my slave, seize the boy.

853
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:09,628
Bring him to me.

854
00:50:11,629 --> 00:50:15,299
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot?
Grab the boy and bring him!

855
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:19,637
Well, it's just that
there's a million people over there,

856
00:50:20,221 --> 00:50:21,931
and I have little arms.

857
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:25,893
I'm just not so sure
how well this plan was thought through.

858
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:30,690
Master?

859
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,734
Master?

860
00:50:35,944 --> 00:50:37,321
Okay, that should do it.

861
00:50:37,696 --> 00:50:40,240
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

862
00:50:40,365 --> 00:50:43,118
Quickly.
Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

863
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:44,536
Everybody ready?

864
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:46,412
Go, Carl.
Yeah!

865
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:51,000
Is it gonna work?

866
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,376
Oh, no!

867
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:57,882
No!

868
00:50:58,007 --> 00:51:01,427
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

869
00:51:01,552 --> 00:51:04,013
You failed!
And it was awesome!

870
00:51:04,138 --> 00:51:06,390
Exceptional!
Outstanding!

871
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,392
I've seen better.

872
00:51:08,517 --> 00:51:12,354
From failing, you learn.
From success, not so much.

873
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:14,231
If I gave up every time I failed,

874
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:16,274
I never would have made
the meatball cannon.

875
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:18,860
I never would have made
my fireproof pants.

876
00:51:21,363 --> 00:51:22,614
Still working out the kinks.

877
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:24,991
Like my husband always says...

878
00:51:32,582 --> 00:51:34,083
 Keep moving 
 Keep moving 

879
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:35,251
 Stop 

880
00:51:40,172 --> 00:51:43,467
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

881
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:45,970
Need another henchman,
something large, not too bright.

882
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:47,805
Something that won't talk back.

883
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,099
What is he still doing here?
Get rid of him.

884
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:51,683
Oh, my noggin.

885
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,144
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your lousy mitts off of me!

886
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:56,271
You're gonna regret this!

887
00:51:57,189 --> 00:52:01,609
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

888
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,238
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

889
00:52:05,488 --> 00:52:07,656
No, I'll make it a surprise.

890
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:15,957
All right, everyone, quiet down.
Quiet down.

891
00:52:16,082 --> 00:52:19,877
I propose a toast to Lewis
and his brilliant failure.

892
00:52:20,002 --> 00:52:22,546
May it lead to success in the future.

893
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:25,340
Gosh, you're all so nice.

894
00:52:25,883 --> 00:52:28,260
If I had a family, I...

895
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:31,346
I'd want them to be just like you.

896
00:52:31,721 --> 00:52:34,182
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

897
00:52:34,307 --> 00:52:35,893
To Lewis!

898
00:52:36,018 --> 00:52:37,019
To Lewis!

899
00:52:37,144 --> 00:52:38,312
Yeah!

900
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:41,356
Come on, Lewis!
Good show, buddy!

901
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:44,526
What if Louis Armstrong said,
I can't?

902
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:45,860
You think he'd have walked
on the moon?

903
00:52:45,985 --> 00:52:48,321
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

904
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:54,076
What did he mean, if he had a family?

905
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:55,577
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

906
00:52:55,703 --> 00:52:57,037
Orphan?

907
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:12,260
Oh, no!
Big boy!

908
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,888
Get up, you pansy!

909
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:16,306
What a great plan!

910
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:20,726
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur.
Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

911
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:24,021
Why didn't you tell me
you had a pet dinosaur?

912
00:53:24,146 --> 00:53:25,189
Because we don't.

913
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:27,442
What are you talking about?
He's standing right here.

914
00:53:29,652 --> 00:53:32,363
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

915
00:53:32,488 --> 00:53:34,115
I need him alive.

916
00:53:36,158 --> 00:53:37,576
Choo-chew on this!

917
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:42,748
Lewis!

918
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:51,381
Ready, aim, fire!

919
00:54:00,265 --> 00:54:01,558
Got you!

920
00:54:03,893 --> 00:54:06,228
You messed with the wrong family!

921
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,654
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

922
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:21,744
No!

923
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:26,832
Okay, everybody,
this dino's deep-dished.

924
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:30,835
Run!

925
00:54:32,962 --> 00:54:34,589
Oh! He ate Carl!

926
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:39,176
Help us! Help! Help!
Oh, goodness!

927
00:54:51,439 --> 00:54:52,440
Oh, no.

928
00:54:58,612 --> 00:54:59,863
Incoming!

929
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:02,282
Run!

930
00:55:03,616 --> 00:55:06,286
Now, go get that boy!

931
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,387
What's going on?

932
00:55:25,596 --> 00:55:26,597
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

933
00:55:26,722 --> 00:55:27,931
I have a big head...

934
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:29,766
...and little arms.

935
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:31,351
I'm just not sure...

936
00:55:31,476 --> 00:55:33,312
...how well this plan was
thought through.

937
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:37,274
Master?

938
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:40,611
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

939
00:55:44,698 --> 00:55:45,824
Bowler Hat Guy!

940
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:47,325
Him you can eat.

941
00:55:47,617 --> 00:55:49,827
Lewis, run!
Wilbur!

942
00:56:08,053 --> 00:56:09,096
No!

943
00:56:30,617 --> 00:56:31,993
Oh, no!

944
00:56:33,411 --> 00:56:36,372
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

945
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:43,712
Nice catch.
Nice meatball shooting!

946
00:56:43,837 --> 00:56:45,380
Guess we made
a pretty good team, huh?

947
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:47,174
Yeah, guess we did.

948
00:56:48,091 --> 00:56:50,011
Are you boys all right?
We're good, Mom.

949
00:56:50,136 --> 00:56:51,887
Yeah, didn't you see us
take out that dinosaur?

950
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:54,348
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

951
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:58,977
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

952
00:56:59,102 --> 00:57:00,687
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

953
00:57:03,857 --> 00:57:05,650
I'm really happy you're safe.

954
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:07,610
Your head.
What?

955
00:57:08,611 --> 00:57:10,196
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

956
00:57:11,322 --> 00:57:14,993
You all sacrificed so much for me.

957
00:57:15,118 --> 00:57:18,079
Well, of course.
You are a special kid.

958
00:57:18,204 --> 00:57:19,414
One of a kind.

959
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:22,792
Okay, you should get him out of here
before something really bad happens.

960
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:26,086
Silly, silly robot.
I've got it all under control.

961
00:57:26,462 --> 00:57:28,755
Okay, everybody,
it's been a long, hard day

962
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:30,757
filled with emotional turmoil
and dinosaur fights,

963
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,802
so why don't you all hit the hay,
and Lewis and me will get going?

964
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:39,390
Do you have to go now?
I mean, you know, it's getting late.

965
00:57:39,515 --> 00:57:42,978
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

966
00:57:43,103 --> 00:57:44,980
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

967
00:57:45,105 --> 00:57:49,067
Well, any time you want to come over,
you just come over.

968
00:57:49,192 --> 00:57:52,236
Mom.
The truth is, we love having you.

969
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:54,864
We really have to go.
No.

970
00:57:55,656 --> 00:57:58,826
No, you don't. You have to stay.

971
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:03,121
I mean, who would be a better family
for you than us?

972
00:58:03,997 --> 00:58:05,499
What do you say, Lewis?

973
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,043
Do you want to be a Robinson?

974
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:13,674
You want to adopt me?

975
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,142
Yeah!
Yes!

976
00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:36,612
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

977
00:58:36,737 --> 00:58:37,905
Now you know the big secret.

978
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,159
Wilbur, what have you done?
How could you bring him here?

979
00:58:42,284 --> 00:58:44,161
That is an excellent question.

980
00:58:44,286 --> 00:58:45,787
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

981
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:47,289
He was just being a good friend.

982
00:58:47,414 --> 00:58:51,543
Lewis, I am so sorry,
but you have to go.

983
00:58:51,668 --> 00:58:53,086
What? You just said...

984
00:58:53,211 --> 00:58:55,088
I know what I said.

985
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:57,174
I'm from the past. So what?

986
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,844
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

987
00:59:01,553 --> 00:59:03,096
You're a great kid,

988
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:06,140
and we would never do anything
to hurt you,

989
00:59:07,475 --> 00:59:11,103
but I'm sorry.
You have to go back to your own time.

990
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:17,359
Yeah, about that,
one of the time machines is broken,

991
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:21,029
and the other one was stolen
by a guy with a bowler hat,

992
00:59:21,154 --> 00:59:24,116
which kind of explains the dino.

993
00:59:29,454 --> 00:59:30,706
I'm calling your father.

994
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:32,374
Wait. If I have to leave,

995
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:34,709
can I at least go back
and find my mom?

996
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:36,544
Wilbur promised.

997
00:59:36,669 --> 00:59:37,879
You promised what?

998
00:59:38,004 --> 00:59:39,839
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

999
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:42,883
You lied to me?
No!

1000
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:45,261
Yes.

1001
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:46,930
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

1002
00:59:47,055 --> 00:59:50,558
I can't believe I was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend!

1003
00:59:51,142 --> 00:59:52,560
I am your friend!

1004
00:59:52,685 --> 00:59:56,230
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

1005
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:21,087
Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.

1006
01:00:21,212 --> 01:00:26,300
All he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew,

1007
01:00:27,218 --> 01:00:31,764
but they won't let him.
We'd let him, though.

1008
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:35,726
Too bad
we don't have a time machine.

1009
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:39,313
Oh, wait. We do.

1010
01:00:39,688 --> 01:00:41,232
Bowler Hat Guy?

1011
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:44,401
Hello, Lewis.
What do you want?

1012
01:00:44,526 --> 01:00:47,195
To make your dream come true.

1013
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,448
All you have to do is put
Humpty Dumpty back together again,

1014
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:53,076
and we'll take you back
to find your mommy.

1015
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,036
Lewis!

1016
01:00:55,995 --> 01:00:58,414
Let's just talk about this, Lewis.
Come on!

1017
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:00,249
I know you're around here somewhere.

1018
01:01:03,044 --> 01:01:04,087
Lewis!

1019
01:01:25,356 --> 01:01:28,734
I can't imagine why you're so interested
in this piece of junk.

1020
01:01:28,735 --> 01:01:31,154
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

1021
01:01:31,279 --> 01:01:33,365
Now, show me how to work this thing.

1022
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,200
It doesn't work. Never did.

1023
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:36,367
Well, supposing it did,

1024
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:38,328
and if one were presenting
the invention to, say,

1025
01:01:38,453 --> 01:01:41,497
a board of directors
for a very large invention company,

1026
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:43,290
where might one find the On switch?

1027
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,459
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

1028
01:01:45,584 --> 01:01:47,753
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

1029
01:01:47,878 --> 01:01:49,504
then push this red button,

1030
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,964
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

1031
01:01:51,089 --> 01:01:52,424
What a stupid way to turn it on!

1032
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:54,593
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

1033
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:56,095
Yes, of course.

1034
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,429
Doris?

1035
01:02:00,307 --> 01:02:01,308
We had a deal!

1036
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:03,310
Crossies! Doesn't count.

1037
01:02:03,435 --> 01:02:05,979
Why are you doing this to me?
I never did anything to you.

1038
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:08,064
You still haven't figured it out?

1039
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:09,524
Figured out what?

1040
01:02:09,649 --> 01:02:11,651
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

1041
01:02:11,776 --> 01:02:14,153
Father of the Future,
inventor extraordinaire,

1042
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:15,780
Keep moving forward?

1043
01:02:15,905 --> 01:02:18,365
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

1044
01:02:22,662 --> 01:02:24,705
Are you saying

1045
01:02:24,831 --> 01:02:27,249
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

1046
01:02:28,209 --> 01:02:30,002
Give the boy a prize.

1047
01:02:30,627 --> 01:02:34,089
You grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time,

1048
01:02:34,214 --> 01:02:35,841
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

1049
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:39,010
Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
Well...

1050
01:02:39,552 --> 01:02:41,346
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

1051
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:42,513
Keep going.

1052
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:44,850
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

1053
01:02:44,975 --> 01:02:46,643
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

1054
01:02:46,768 --> 01:02:49,437
But what does that have to do
with you?

1055
01:02:50,522 --> 01:02:53,441
Allow me to shed some light
on the subject.

1056
01:02:56,402 --> 01:02:57,778
My old room!

1057
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:00,281
I think you mean our old room.

1058
01:03:00,406 --> 01:03:03,450
What?
Yes! Yes, it is I,

1059
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:04,868
Mike Yagoobian!

1060
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:09,206
I know.
I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

1061
01:03:09,332 --> 01:03:10,750
How did you end up like this?

1062
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:15,671
Well, it's a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream,

1063
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:18,423
a dream of winning
a Little League championship,

1064
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,305
a dream that was ruined
in the last inning.

1065
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:28,599
We lost by one run because of me.

1066
01:03:28,724 --> 01:03:29,809
Get him!

1067
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:33,979
If I hadn't fallen asleep,
I would have caught the ball!

1068
01:03:34,146 --> 01:03:36,149
And we would have won!

1069
01:03:36,274 --> 01:03:37,817
Do you understand?

1070
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:40,570
For some reason,
no one wanted to adopt me.

1071
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:43,823
Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson
graduates from college at age 14.

1072
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:47,659
This year's Nobel Prize goes
to a young Cornelius Robinson.

1073
01:03:47,785 --> 01:03:49,369
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

1074
01:03:49,494 --> 01:03:51,455
Hey, Goob,
wanna come over to my house today?

1075
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,498
They all hated me.

1076
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:57,168
Eventually, they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left,

1077
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,920
except me.

1078
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:00,964
Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.

1079
01:04:01,089 --> 01:04:02,299
Robinson reaches out to...
It's new name,

1080
01:04:02,424 --> 01:04:04,426
Robinson Industries.
Cornelius Robinson!

1081
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:07,637
Cornelius Robinson is now...
Now here's another amazing...

1082
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:12,934
It was then
that I realised it wasn't my fault.

1083
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:14,435
It was yours.

1084
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,771
If you hadn't kept me up all night
working on your stupid project,

1085
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:19,940
then I wouldn't have missed the catch,

1086
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:24,111
so I devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge.

1087
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:29,617
Robinson, you stink!

1088
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:34,288
Then, just as I was on the brink
of destroying Robinson Industries,

1089
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,165
I met her.

1090
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,503
We retreated to our villainous lair,

1091
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,756
where Doris spun a tale
of deception and woe.

1092
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:49,301
Apparently, you invented her
to be a Helping Hat,

1093
01:04:49,426 --> 01:04:51,638
a slave to humankind,

1094
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,811
but Doris knew she was capable
of so much more.

1095
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,902
However, you didn't see
her true potential.

1096
01:05:07,027 --> 01:05:09,029
Got it.
So you shut her down,

1097
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,663
or so you thought.

1098
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:29,507
We both had a score
to settle with you,

1099
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:35,303
and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant, Doris' was...

1100
01:05:35,304 --> 01:05:37,264
Well, we went with Doris',

1101
01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:41,977
but I made
a very, very important contribution.

1102
01:05:41,978 --> 01:05:44,563
Together we made the perfect team.

1103
01:05:54,739 --> 01:05:55,740
Wilbur!

1104
01:05:55,865 --> 01:05:58,534
Make sure you shut that door tight,
or else the alarm won't engage.

1105
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,786
Yeah, Mom.

1106
01:06:03,372 --> 01:06:05,874
I went to your house,
snuck in the garage

1107
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,752
and stole the time machine,

1108
01:06:10,755 --> 01:06:15,718
all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door.

1109
01:06:20,055 --> 01:06:23,100
And now all that's left
is to return to Inventco,

1110
01:06:23,225 --> 01:06:25,977
where I'll pass off
your little gizmo as my own.

1111
01:06:26,102 --> 01:06:28,480
But you have no idea
what that could do to this future!

1112
01:06:28,605 --> 01:06:31,732
I don't care. I just
want to ruin your life.

1113
01:06:31,858 --> 01:06:33,485
Goob, I had no idea.

1114
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,487
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

1115
01:06:35,612 --> 01:06:38,281
How many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like Goob?

1116
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:40,783
Look, I'm sorry
your life turned out so bad,

1117
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:42,994
but don't blame me.
You messed it up yourself.

1118
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,831
You just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was

1119
01:06:46,956 --> 01:06:50,709
let go of the past
and keep moving forward.

1120
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:51,877
Let's see.

1121
01:06:52,002 --> 01:06:54,880
Take responsibility for my own life
or blame you.

1122
01:06:56,256 --> 01:06:58,801
Blame you wins hands down!

1123
01:07:02,304 --> 01:07:05,557
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

1124
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:16,943
Doris, would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me, please?

1125
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,243
No!

1126
01:07:26,661 --> 01:07:30,915
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan
and run, but ta-ta!

1127
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,752
But...

1128
01:07:34,877 --> 01:07:36,879
I bet you're glad to see me.

1129
01:07:38,005 --> 01:07:40,090
That's for not locking the garage door.

1130
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:42,759
You know about that?

1131
01:07:42,884 --> 01:07:44,260
I know everything.

1132
01:07:44,385 --> 01:07:45,386
You gotta admit,

1133
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:47,638
this will be a great story
to tell me someday.

1134
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:53,103
Look at that, boys.
We're almost home free.

1135
01:08:02,153 --> 01:08:03,612
Oh, no!

1136
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:07,116
Take a good look around, boys,

1137
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:09,952
because your future
is about to change.

1138
01:08:11,578 --> 01:08:14,123
Lewis, you have to fix
the time machine.

1139
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:16,333
No. No, I can't.

1140
01:08:22,923 --> 01:08:25,133
What about your dad?
You could call him.

1141
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:27,761
You are my dad.
But that's in the future.

1142
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:30,596
There won't be a future
unless you fix the time machine.

1143
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:35,768
Look, I messed up.

1144
01:08:36,018 --> 01:08:38,980
I left the garage unlocked,
and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

1145
01:08:39,105 --> 01:08:40,148
but now it's up to you.

1146
01:08:42,275 --> 01:08:43,651
You can do it, Dad.

1147
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:50,157
Lewis? Lewis!
Wilbur? Wilbur!

1148
01:08:54,286 --> 01:08:55,370
Wilbur.

1149
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,707
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

1150
01:09:13,346 --> 01:09:15,473
Prepare to be amazed.

1151
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:18,309
I call it the Memory Scanner.

1152
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:21,895
So, Yagoobian, any other ideas
you'd like to share with us?

1153
01:09:22,021 --> 01:09:25,399
Yes. I call them Helping Hats.

1154
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,029
They're everywhere!

1155
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:34,950
Doris, what's happening?
I don't understand.

1156
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:37,869
I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.

1157
01:09:39,121 --> 01:09:41,122
No!

1158
01:09:46,878 --> 01:09:50,381
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

1159
01:09:50,756 --> 01:09:53,884
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

1160
01:11:53,374 --> 01:11:56,543
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

1161
01:12:07,221 --> 01:12:12,225
Take a good look around, Doris,
'cause your future's about to change.

1162
01:12:20,691 --> 01:12:22,193
Goob, stop!

1163
01:12:22,902 --> 01:12:23,986
You don't know what you're doing!

1164
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:26,196
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

1165
01:12:26,322 --> 01:12:27,449
She's using you, Goob,

1166
01:12:27,574 --> 01:12:29,742
and when she gets what she wants,
she'll get rid of you.

1167
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:31,661
What? What?

1168
01:12:36,999 --> 01:12:39,460
I am never going to invent you.

1169
01:12:45,757 --> 01:12:48,218
Come on, Goob.
I've got to show you something.

1170
01:12:57,477 --> 01:12:58,645
Doris?

1171
01:12:59,104 --> 01:13:00,813
I thought she was my friend.

1172
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,929
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

1173
01:13:37,723 --> 01:13:39,225
I'll hold him while you run for help.

1174
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:40,392
Let him go.

1175
01:13:40,768 --> 01:13:43,271
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

1176
01:13:43,396 --> 01:13:46,065
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

1177
01:13:46,232 --> 01:13:47,984
What?
He's my old roommate,

1178
01:13:48,109 --> 01:13:49,652
and I really think
you guys should adopt him.

1179
01:13:49,777 --> 01:13:51,987
Are you nuts?
Give me one good reason why not.

1180
01:13:52,112 --> 01:13:53,530
I'll give you three good reasons.

1181
01:13:53,656 --> 01:13:56,074
He stole our time machine,
tried to ruin your future,

1182
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,535
and he smells
like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

1183
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:02,122
May I remind you, I'm your father,
and you have to do what I say.

1184
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,585
Okay, Mr Yagoobian,
do you want to be a...

1185
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,796
Where'd he go?
Goob?

1186
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:12,007
Goob!

1187
01:14:13,967 --> 01:14:15,218
Goob.

1188
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:43,787
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

1189
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,497
No, I'm...
Do you have a temperature?

1190
01:14:45,622 --> 01:14:47,082
Brain fog?
Scurvy?

1191
01:14:47,207 --> 01:14:48,291
Tapeworm?
Cellulite?

1192
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:51,043
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

1193
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:54,922
In fact,
better than I've felt in a long time.

1194
01:14:55,047 --> 01:14:58,300
Franny, they're gone.
Oh, this is terrible!

1195
01:14:58,425 --> 01:15:00,178
Oh, boy.
Well, he's home early.

1196
01:15:00,303 --> 01:15:03,806
Franny, where are you?
The time machines are gone!

1197
01:15:17,444 --> 01:15:19,195
Ratted out by the old lady.

1198
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,489
Harsh.

1199
01:15:26,203 --> 01:15:27,412
Okay.

1200
01:15:37,922 --> 01:15:41,091
Yeah, beats working
in an office every day.

1201
01:15:41,216 --> 01:15:43,051
Yeah, no kidding.

1202
01:15:43,218 --> 01:15:45,595
Hey!
Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

1203
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:47,097
Yeah.

1204
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:52,144
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

1205
01:16:05,907 --> 01:16:08,201
It was our first real invention.

1206
01:16:08,826 --> 01:16:10,619
It's the one that started it all.

1207
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:11,871
Wowie.

1208
01:16:12,871 --> 01:16:16,584
So if I go back now,
then this will be my future.

1209
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:19,337
Well, that depends on you.

1210
01:16:19,462 --> 01:16:20,463
Nothing is set in stone.

1211
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:24,383
You gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward.

1212
01:16:28,387 --> 01:16:31,723
Since it's gonna work this time,
that means I...

1213
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:36,102
We won't finally get to see
what Mom looks like?

1214
01:16:38,563 --> 01:16:39,897
Do we ever meet her?

1215
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:45,028
I think
you're just gonna have to get back

1216
01:16:45,153 --> 01:16:47,906
to that science fair
and find out for yourself.

1217
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:50,241
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

1218
01:16:51,284 --> 01:16:54,412
That's because we are one smart kid.

1219
01:16:59,416 --> 01:17:00,417
So long!
Bye-bye, Lewis!

1220
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:03,044
Farewell, future brother-in-law.
So long! See you later, Lewis!

1221
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:04,963
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

1222
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,384
Have a safe trip, little Lewis.
I will.

1223
01:17:08,509 --> 01:17:10,260
Hey, while I got you here,

1224
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:13,805
just a couple of little suggestions
regarding my design.

1225
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:18,476
Let's face it, these skinny limbs
don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

1226
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:21,604
All that really matters is,
hey, don't forget to invent me.

1227
01:17:21,729 --> 01:17:24,148
Are you kidding? No way!
I love you.

1228
01:17:25,316 --> 01:17:27,776
There's so many things
I wish I could ask you.

1229
01:17:27,902 --> 01:17:30,529
Excuse me.
Time travel now, questions later.

1230
01:17:30,654 --> 01:17:31,656
But I...
Don't worry.

1231
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:34,617
Just get back to that science fair,
and we'll see you real soon.

1232
01:17:34,742 --> 01:17:38,120
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

1233
01:17:38,245 --> 01:17:40,789
Goodbye, son.
Thanks again for everything!

1234
01:17:40,915 --> 01:17:43,417
Wait. Lewis, one more thing.
Yeah?

1235
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:48,421
Just a little tip for the future.
I am always right.

1236
01:17:48,547 --> 01:17:51,466
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

1237
01:17:53,551 --> 01:17:56,763
She's right.
I'd just go with it if I were you.

1238
01:17:57,681 --> 01:17:58,974
And I am.

1239
01:17:59,766 --> 01:18:01,518
Then you're absolutely right.

1240
01:18:04,103 --> 01:18:05,938
All right, I'm coming.

1241
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,357
Well, it's not like
you're never gonna see them again.

1242
01:18:08,482 --> 01:18:10,276
They are your family, after all.

1243
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:41,138
Wait a minute.

1244
01:18:41,264 --> 01:18:43,349
You're supposed to take me back
to the science fair.

1245
01:18:43,474 --> 01:18:44,642
I know.

1246
01:18:50,231 --> 01:18:52,984
Well, I think
you punched in the wrong numbers.

1247
01:18:53,109 --> 01:18:55,736
We agreed that,
if you fixed the time machine,

1248
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:57,738
I'd take you back to see your mom.

1249
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,031
What?

1250
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:19,008
A deal's a deal.

1251
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:25,254
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

1252
01:21:26,005 --> 01:21:29,174
Because I already have a family.

1253
01:21:38,349 --> 01:21:41,978
I never thought my dad
would be my best friend.

1254
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:45,148
Now, now, don't make me come
and bail you out again.

1255
01:21:46,942 --> 01:21:47,984
I won't.

1256
01:21:48,109 --> 01:21:50,070
Remember, I've got a time machine.

1257
01:21:50,195 --> 01:21:51,696
If you mess up again,
I'll just keep coming back

1258
01:21:51,821 --> 01:21:52,989
till you get it right.

1259
01:21:55,241 --> 01:21:56,867
You got that motto?
I got it.

1260
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:58,244
Don't forget it.

1261
01:21:58,369 --> 01:22:00,162
I don't think that's possible.

1262
01:22:01,622 --> 01:22:02,831
You better get going.

1263
01:22:03,624 --> 01:22:05,167
See you later, Wilbur.

1264
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,103
Wait a minute!

1265
01:22:33,694 --> 01:22:35,697
Goob! Goob, wake up!

1266
01:22:35,822 --> 01:22:36,864
What?

1267
01:22:39,784 --> 01:22:41,160
That's it!

1268
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:52,045
Mr Willerstein,
I know what went wrong.

1269
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:54,381
Can I have one more chance? Please!

1270
01:22:56,507 --> 01:22:59,302
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

1271
01:23:00,887 --> 01:23:02,597
I need a volunteer.

1272
01:23:05,934 --> 01:23:07,560
Now, just give me a date to input.

1273
01:23:07,685 --> 01:23:09,103
Well, now, let's see.

1274
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:12,356
There's my first science fair,
the day I got my first microscope,

1275
01:23:12,481 --> 01:23:15,609
the time I swam the English Channel,
my first gold medal for the luge.

1276
01:23:16,777 --> 01:23:17,945
I know.

1277
01:23:19,071 --> 01:23:20,322
Perfect!

1278
01:23:32,751 --> 01:23:35,754
You look gorgeous.
He's a lucky guy.

1279
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:39,632
Oh! It works.

1280
01:23:39,757 --> 01:23:42,218
It works!
It works.

1281
01:23:42,802 --> 01:23:45,054
You look beautiful, Lucille.

1282
01:23:50,309 --> 01:23:51,478
Bud?

1283
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,689
Would you look at that?
Whoa!

1284
01:23:54,814 --> 01:23:56,607
Honey! Honey, you're just in time.

1285
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:59,610
Lucille!
You did it, Lewis! You did it!

1286
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:01,111
This invention is brilliant!

1287
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:02,696
Kid, you're this fair's MVP!

1288
01:24:02,821 --> 01:24:04,948
That was some show you put on.

1289
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:08,535
You're a real special kid,

1290
01:24:11,329 --> 01:24:14,540
but you don't look like a Lewis.
You look more like a...

1291
01:24:14,665 --> 01:24:17,377
Cornelius. I get that a lot.

1292
01:24:18,545 --> 01:24:20,964
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.

1293
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,465
No harm done.

1294
01:24:23,341 --> 01:24:25,677
Frankie, what have I told you
about running away?

1295
01:24:25,802 --> 01:24:28,137
Frankie?
My star pupil.

1296
01:24:28,262 --> 01:24:33,142
My name's Franny,
and I teach frogs music.

1297
01:24:33,267 --> 01:24:34,393
Really?

1298
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:38,230
You know that frogs
have more musical ability than people?

1299
01:24:38,355 --> 01:24:40,774
But nobody believes me.

1300
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:43,694
They all think I'm crazy.

1301
01:24:45,029 --> 01:24:47,823
You think I'm crazy, too.

1302
01:24:47,948 --> 01:24:50,951
No. No, I think you're right.

1303
01:24:54,454 --> 01:24:56,247
Over here? There he is.

1304
01:24:56,372 --> 01:24:59,584
Kid, we'd like to get a story
on you for the local paper.

1305
01:24:59,709 --> 01:25:02,294
You've got a bright future ahead of you.

1306
01:25:05,422 --> 01:25:06,673
 Let it go 

1307
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,884
Yeah.

1308
01:25:08,259 --> 01:25:11,262
 Let it roll right off your shoulder 

1309
01:25:11,387 --> 01:25:12,847
 Don't you know 

1310
01:25:14,557 --> 01:25:17,059
 The hardest part is over 

1311
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,811
 Let it in 

1312
01:25:19,895 --> 01:25:22,689
 Let your clarity define you 

1313
01:25:22,814 --> 01:25:24,399
 In the end 

1314
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:29,862
 We will only just remember 
 How it feels 

1315
01:25:39,622 --> 01:25:41,666
 Let it slide 

1316
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:45,628
 Let your troubles fall behind you 

1317
01:25:45,753 --> 01:25:47,546
 Let it shine 

1318
01:25:48,547 --> 01:25:51,216
 Until you feel it all around you 

1319
01:25:51,383 --> 01:25:54,052
 And I don't mind 

1320
01:25:54,177 --> 01:25:57,013
 If it's me you need to turn to 

1321
01:25:57,138 --> 01:25:59,391
 We'll get by 

1322
01:26:00,017 --> 01:26:04,396
 It's the heart that really matters 
 In the end 

1323
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:07,524
 Our lives are made 

1324
01:26:07,649 --> 01:26:10,360
 In these small hours 

1325
01:26:10,652 --> 01:26:13,071
 These little wonders 

1326
01:26:13,237 --> 01:26:16,115
 These twists and turns of fate 

1327
01:26:16,407 --> 01:26:18,743
 Time falls away 

1328
01:26:18,868 --> 01:26:22,079
 But these small hours 

1329
01:26:22,204 --> 01:26:27,543
 These small hours still remain 

1330
01:26:27,919 --> 01:26:30,254
 All of my regret 

1331
01:26:30,379 --> 01:26:33,173
 Will wash away somehow 

1332
01:26:33,424 --> 01:26:35,968
 But I cannot forget 

1333
01:26:36,093 --> 01:26:39,387
 The way I feel right now 

1334
01:27:03,536 --> 01:27:05,245
 The future has arrived 

1335
01:27:06,538 --> 01:27:08,582
 The future has arrived 

1336
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,751
 The future has arrived 

1337
01:27:13,128 --> 01:27:15,422
 The future has arrived 

1338
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:31,229
 The future's arrived 

1339
01:27:31,354 --> 01:27:32,897
 Nobody can doubt 

1340
01:27:33,022 --> 01:27:36,108
 The future is what everything's about 

1341
01:27:36,233 --> 01:27:39,028
 It's better for you 
 And it's better for me 

1342
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:42,532
 It's better than what everybody 
 Thought it would be 

1343
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:44,617
 The future has arrived 

1344
01:27:46,077 --> 01:27:48,746
 The future has arrived today 

1345
01:27:49,371 --> 01:27:50,956
 The future's alive 

1346
01:27:51,081 --> 01:27:52,583
 Alive as can be 

1347
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:54,084
 Just open your eyes 

1348
01:27:54,209 --> 01:27:55,835
 It's plain to see 

1349
01:27:55,961 --> 01:27:57,420
 Just don't be afraid 

1350
01:27:57,545 --> 01:27:59,339
 Just keep going on 

1351
01:27:59,464 --> 01:28:02,258
 One step at a time 
 And you can't go wrong 

1352
01:28:02,383 --> 01:28:04,928
 It's time to create 

1353
01:28:05,053 --> 01:28:07,055
 Time to grow 

1354
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,682
 If you feel right 

1355
01:28:08,807 --> 01:28:12,060
 The world, yeah 
 She's changing 

1356
01:28:12,185 --> 01:28:14,812
 Don't it make you feel alive? 

1357
01:28:15,855 --> 01:28:17,481
 The future has arrived 

1358
01:28:18,941 --> 01:28:21,527
 The future has arrived today 

1359
01:28:22,444 --> 01:28:23,987
 The future's alive 

1360
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:28,199
 The future is alive today 

1361
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:38,835
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

1362
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,838
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

1363
01:28:41,963 --> 01:28:43,548
 The future's arrived 

1364
01:28:43,673 --> 01:28:45,174
 Nobody can doubt 

1365
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,636
 The future is what everything's about 

1366
01:28:48,761 --> 01:28:51,764
 It's better for you 
 It's better for me 

1367
01:28:51,889 --> 01:28:54,767
 It's better than what everybody 
 Thought it would be 

1368
01:28:54,893 --> 01:28:57,603
 It's time to create 

1369
01:28:57,729 --> 01:28:59,272
 Time to grow 

1370
01:28:59,564 --> 01:29:01,440
 If you feel right 

1371
01:29:01,565 --> 01:29:04,693
 The world, yeah 
 She's changing 

1372
01:29:04,818 --> 01:29:07,988
 And life's rearranging 

1373
01:29:08,113 --> 01:29:10,032
 Don't it make you feel alive? 

1374
01:29:10,157 --> 01:29:11,700
 The future has arrived 

1375
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:13,368
 The future has arrived 

1376
01:29:14,869 --> 01:29:17,372
 The future has arrived today 

1377
01:29:18,081 --> 01:29:19,957
 The future's alive 

1378
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,045
 The future is alive today 

1379
01:29:24,671 --> 01:29:26,548
 The future has arrived 

1380
01:29:27,924 --> 01:29:30,760
 The future has arrived today 

1381
01:29:31,511 --> 01:29:33,220
 The future's alive 

1382
01:29:34,513 --> 01:29:37,516
 The future is alive today 

1383
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,685
 The future has arrived 

1384
01:29:41,186 --> 01:29:44,022
 The future has arrived today 

1385
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:46,400
 The future's alive 

1386
01:29:47,735 --> 01:29:50,404
 The future is alive today 

1387
01:29:51,238 --> 01:29:54,157
 The future has arrived today 

1388
01:29:54,282 --> 01:29:57,077
 The future has arrived today 

1389
01:29:57,619 --> 01:30:00,413
 The future has arrived today 

1390
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:03,749
 The future has arrived today 

1391
01:30:10,214 --> 01:30:15,428
 Waiting to cross the Rubicon 

1392
01:30:15,553 --> 01:30:20,266
 Wondering what side I'm on 

1393
01:30:20,683 --> 01:30:25,479
 What are these visions 
 Of me as a young man 

1394
01:30:25,604 --> 01:30:31,609
 With one arm pointing 
 And the other arm holding your hand? 

1395
01:30:31,734 --> 01:30:36,531
 Needing a plan to keep you near 

1396
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:41,619
 Blowing a horn so you can hear 

1397
01:30:41,995 --> 01:30:46,791
 If it was only my love and devotion 

1398
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:51,462
 This world would suddenly be 
 In a state of 

1399
01:30:51,587 --> 01:30:55,966
 Commotion 

1400
01:30:56,466 --> 01:31:00,929
 Emotional commotion 

1401
01:31:01,054 --> 01:31:06,185
 Emotional commotion 

1402
01:31:07,352 --> 01:31:11,857
 Emotional commotion 

1403
01:31:11,982 --> 01:31:14,526
 Emotional commotion 

1404
01:31:36,255 --> 01:31:40,300
 I never get around 
 Under the sun and the stars 

1405
01:31:40,425 --> 01:31:46,306
 And I may be always frowning 

1406
01:31:46,431 --> 01:31:50,685
 But one day you will see 
 Under the sun and the stars 

1407
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:56,566
 You will turn around 
 And I'll be 

1408
01:31:56,691 --> 01:32:00,820
 In motion 

1409
01:32:01,612 --> 01:32:06,158
 Emotional commotion 

1410
01:32:06,283 --> 01:32:12,164
 Emotional commotion 

1411
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:16,876
 Emotional commotion 

1412
01:32:17,002 --> 01:32:22,633
 Emotional commotion 

1413
01:32:23,383 --> 01:32:27,888
 Emotional commotion 

1414
01:32:28,013 --> 01:32:34,602
 Emotional motion

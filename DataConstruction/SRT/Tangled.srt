1
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,857
This is the story of how I died.

2
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:03,988
But don't worry, this is a fun story,
and the truth is, it isn't even mine.

3
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:07,200
This is the story of a girl
named Rapunzel.

4
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,578
And it starts with the sun.

5
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:17,085
Once upon a time, a single drop
of sunlight fell from the heavens.

6
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:22,840
And from this small drop of sun
grew a magic golden flower.

7
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,970
It had the ability to heal
the sick and injured.

8
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:32,016
You see that old woman over there?
You might want to remember her.

9
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:33,101
She's kind of important.

10
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,854
Centuries passed

11
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,232
and a hop, skip and a boat ride away
there grew a kingdom.

12
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,361
The kingdom was ruled
by a beloved king and queen.

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,990
And the queen
was about to have a baby.

14
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:48,741
But she got sick.

15
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:50,827
Really sick.

16
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,870
She was running out of time,

17
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:56,040
and that's when people
start to look for a miracle.

18
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,460
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.

19
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,714
I told you she'd be important.

20
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:05,049
Instead of sharing the sun's gift,

21
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:07,844
this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power

22
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,222
and used it to keep herself young
for hundreds of years.

23
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:14,809
And all she had to do
was sing a special song.

24
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,188
Flower, gleam and glow

25
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:23,651
Let your power shine

26
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:27,405
Make the clock reverse

27
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,326
Bring back what once was mine

28
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,579
What once was mine

29
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:38,791
You get the gist. She sings to it,
she turns young. Creepy, right?

30
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,678
We found it!

31
00:02:56,852 --> 00:03:01,522
The magic of the golden flower
healed the queen.

32
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:07,362
A healthy baby girl, a princess
was born, with beautiful golden hair.

33
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:19,040
I'll give you a hint, that's Rapunzel.

34
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,293
To celebrate her birth,

35
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:25,713
the king and queen
launched a flying lantern into the sky.

36
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:34,347
And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.

37
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,810
And then that moment ended.

38
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:44,649
Flower, gleam and glow

39
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,238
Let your power shine

40
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:52,407
Make the clock...

41
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,791
Gothel broke into the castle,
stole the child,

42
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,918
and just like that, gone!

43
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,549
The kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the princess.

44
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:12,927
For deep within the forest,
in a hidden tower,

45
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,512
Gothel raised the child as her own.

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,432
Save what has been lost

47
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:21,477
Bring back what once was mine

48
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:24,188
What once was mine

49
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,858
Gothel had found
her new magic flower,

50
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:29,652
but this time,
she was determined to keep it hidden.

51
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,864
Why can't I go outside?

52
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,575
The outside world is a dangerous place,

53
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,202
filled with horrible, selfish people.

54
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:41,372
You must stay here, where you're safe.

55
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:43,040
Do you understand, flower?

56
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,500
Yes, Mommy.

57
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:52,341
But the walls of that tower
could not hide everything.

58
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:57,096
Each year, on her birthday,

59
00:04:57,181 --> 00:05:00,725
the king and queen released
thousands of lanterns into the sky

60
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:05,897
in hope that one day
their lost princess would return.

61
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,923
Well, I guess
Pascal's not hiding out here.

62
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,135
Gotcha!

63
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:42,391
That's 22 for me.
How about 23 out of 45?

64
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,937
Okay. Well, what do you want to do?

65
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:53,528
Yeah. I don't think so.
I like it in here, and so do you.

66
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:59,033
Come on, Pascal.
It's not so bad in there.

67
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:15,258
Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup

68
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:20,388
Start on the chores
And sweep till the floor's all clean

69
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,475
Polish and wax, do laundry
and mop and shine up

70
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:28,980
Sweep again and by then it's, like, 7:15

71
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:33,484
And so I'll read a book
Or maybe two or three

72
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:37,822
I'll add a few new paintings
to my gallery

73
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:42,243
I'll play guitar and knit
and cook and basically

74
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:46,872
Just wonder when will my life begin?

75
00:06:56,216 --> 00:07:00,428
Then after lunch it's puzzles
and darts and baking

76
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:04,974
Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet and chess

77
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,853
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle-making

78
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:13,649
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch
Take a climb, sew a dress

79
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:17,695
And I'll reread the books
If I have time to spare

80
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:22,158
I'll paint the walls some more
I'm sure there's room somewhere

81
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,620
And then I'll brush and brush
and brush and brush my hair

82
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:31,250
Stuck in the same place
I've always been

83
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:36,380
And I'll keep wondering and wondering
and wondering and wondering

84
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:39,842
When will my life begin?

85
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:45,222
Tomorrow night

86
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,560
the lights will appear

87
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,522
Just like they do

88
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:58,444
on my birthday each year

89
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,240
What is it like

90
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:08,245
out there where they glow

91
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:12,958
Now that I'm older

92
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:18,005
Mother might just let me go

93
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:44,824
Wow! I could get used
to a view like this.

94
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,784
Rider, come on!

95
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:52,123
Hold on. Yep. I'm used to it.
Guys, I want a castle.

96
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:55,418
We do this job,
you can buy your own castle.

97
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,807
Hay fever?
Yeah.

98
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:16,397
Wait! Hey, wait!

99
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:19,984
Can't you picture me in a castle
of my own? Because I certainly can.

100
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:22,945
All the things we've seen,
and it's only 8:00 in the morning!

101
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,115
Gentlemen, this is a very big day!

102
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:30,744
This is it! This is a very big day, Pascal.

103
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:34,748
I'm finally going to do it.
I'm going to ask her.

104
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,917
Rapunzel!

105
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,086
Let down your hair!

106
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,088
It's time!

107
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,676
I know, I know.
Come on. Don't let her see you.

108
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:51,974
Rapunzel!
I'm not getting any younger down here!

109
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,393
Coming, Mother!

110
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:21,212
Hi. Welcome home, Mother.

111
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:24,548
Rapunzel, how you manage to do that

112
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:27,801
every single day without fail.

113
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:30,304
It looks absolutely exhausting, darling.

114
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:32,765
Oh, it's nothing.

115
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:35,142
Then I don't know why it takes so long.

116
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,645
Oh, darling, I'm just teasing.

117
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:41,148
All right.

118
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,568
So, Mother, as you know
tomorrow is a very big day...

119
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,237
Rapunzel, look in that mirror.

120
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,780
You know what I see?

121
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:51,951
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

122
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,246
Oh, look, you're here, too.

123
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,749
I'm just teasing.
Stop taking everything so seriously.

124
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:02,253
Okay. So, Mother,
as I was saying, tomorrow is...

125
00:11:02,337 --> 00:11:04,797
Rapunzel,
Mother's feeling a little run-down.

126
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:07,883
Would you sing for me, dear?
Then we'll talk.

127
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,302
Of course, Mother.

128
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,020
Flower, gleam and glow
Let your power shine

129
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,772
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine

130
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,607
Heal what has been hurt
Change the Fates' design

131
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:25,776
Save what has been lost
Bring back what once was mine

132
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,611
Rapunzel!
So, Mother,

133
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:30,531
earlier I was saying tomorrow
is a big day, and you didn't respond.

134
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,367
So, I'm just going to tell you,
it's my birthday!

135
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:36,370
Ta-da!
No, no, no. Can't be.

136
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:39,790
I distinctly remember.
Your birthday was last year.

137
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:44,211
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

138
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:49,550
Mother, I'm turning 18,
and I wanted to ask...

139
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,720
What I really want for this birthday...

140
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,180
Actually what I wanted
for quite a few birthdays now...

141
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,433
Rapunzel, please,
stop with the mumbling.

142
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,144
You know how I feel about
the mumbling. Blah-blah-blah-blah.

143
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:02,896
It's very annoying!
I'm just teasing. You're adorable.

144
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,815
I love you so much, darling.

145
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,323
I want to see the floating lights.

146
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:16,118
What?

147
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,997
I was hoping you would take me
to see the floating lights.

148
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,167
You mean the stars.

149
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,752
That's the thing.

150
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:29,089
I've charted stars,
and they're always constant.

151
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:33,010
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

152
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:35,054
Only on my birthday.

153
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:40,309
And I can't help but feel like
they're meant for me.

154
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,062
I need to see them, Mother.

155
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:46,690
And not just from my window, in person.

156
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,360
I have to know what they are.

157
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:53,530
You want to go outside?
Why, Rapunzel...

158
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:57,076
Look at you, as fragile as a flower

159
00:12:57,786 --> 00:13:01,622
Still a little sapling, just a sprout

160
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:04,541
You know why we stay up in this tower

161
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:06,210
I know, but...
That's right.

162
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:10,172
To keep you safe and sound, dear

163
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,966
Guess I always knew
this day was coming

164
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,637
Knew that soon
you'd want to leave the nest

165
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,555
Soon but not yet

166
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:21,141
Shh!
Trust me, pet

167
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:25,312
Mother knows best

168
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,734
Mother knows best
Listen to your mother

169
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,737
It's a scary world out there

170
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,406
Mother knows best

171
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,450
One way or another
Something will go wrong

172
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,202
I swear

173
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,080
Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand

174
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:45,249
Cannibals and snakes, the plague

175
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,417
No!
Yes.

176
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:49,169
Also large bugs
Men with pointy teeth

177
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:52,673
And stop! No more, you'll just upset me

178
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:55,759
Mother's right here
Mother will protect you

179
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:59,096
Darling, here's what I suggest

180
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,350
Skip the drama
Stay with Mama

181
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:08,230
Mother knows best

182
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,277
Mother knows best
Take it from your mumsy

183
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,196
On your own, you won't survive

184
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:19,199
Sloppy, underdressed
Immature, clumsy

185
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:22,119
Please, they'll eat you up alive

186
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:25,372
Gullible, naive
Positively grubby

187
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:28,208
Ditsy and a bit... Well, hmm, vague

188
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:31,128
Plus, I believe, getting kind of chubby

189
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:35,299
I'm just saying 'cause I wuv you

190
00:14:35,383 --> 00:14:38,469
Mother understands
Mother's here to help you

191
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:43,807
All I have is one request

192
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:50,522
Rapunzel?
Yes?

193
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,819
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again.

194
00:14:57,781 --> 00:14:59,072
Yes, Mother.

195
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:03,327
I love you very much, dear.

196
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,621
I love you more.

197
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:08,081
I love you most.

198
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,376
Don't forget it

199
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:15,130
You'll regret it

200
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:19,718
Mother knows best

201
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:26,934
Ta-ta! I'll see you in a bit, my flower!

202
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:30,771
I'll be here.

203
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:55,796
Oh, no.

204
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,423
This is bad. This is very, very bad.

205
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:00,217
This is really bad.

206
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:03,720
They just can't get my nose right.

207
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,180
Who cares?

208
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,392
It's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.

209
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:26,660
All right. Okay.
Give me a boost and I'll pull you up.

210
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:29,621
Give us the satchel first.

211
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:36,420
I can't believe that after all we've been
through together, you don't trust me?

212
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,965
Ouch.

213
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,892
Now help us up, pretty boy!

214
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,853
Sorry, my hands are full.

215
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:54,980
What?

216
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,690
Rider!

217
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:05,282
Retrieve that satchel at any cost!

218
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:06,658
Yes, sir!

219
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,761
We got him now, Maximus.

220
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:41,151
Come on, fleabag! Forward!

221
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,072
No.

222
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,702
Stop it! Stop it!
Give it to me! Give me that!

223
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:34,347
Alone at last.

224
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:13,238
Okay. I've got a person in my closet.

225
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,907
I've got a person in my closet.

226
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,996
I've got a person in my closet!

227
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,251
Too weak to handle myself out there,
huh, Mother?

228
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:29,462
Well, tell that to my frying pan.

229
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,714
Rapunzel!

230
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,218
Let down your hair!

231
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:18,136
One moment, Mother!

232
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,263
I have a big surprise!

233
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:22,641
I do, too!

234
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:25,060
I bet my surprise is bigger!

235
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:27,729
I seriously doubt it.

236
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:32,484
I brought back parsnips. I'm going
to make hazelnut soup for dinner.

237
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,945
Your favourite. Surprise!

238
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,447
Well, Mother,
there's something I want to tell you.

239
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:40,367
Oh, Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

240
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,911
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

241
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,330
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier.

242
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,958
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

243
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:50,460
Floating lights,
and, yes, I'm leading up to that.

244
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:53,046
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

245
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,215
No, Mother, I'm just saying,

246
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:57,801
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

247
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:01,137
I know you're not strong enough
to handle yourself out there.

248
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:04,474
But if you just...
We're done talking about this.

249
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:07,102
Trust me! I know what I'm...
Rapunzel.

250
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,729
Oh, come on!
Enough with the lights!

251
00:23:09,814 --> 00:23:14,234
You are not leaving this tower! Ever!

252
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:24,244
Great. Now I'm the bad guy.

253
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,592
All I was going to say, Mother, is that...

254
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:43,013
I know what I want for my birthday now.

255
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:45,098
And what is that?

256
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:46,850
New paint.

257
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:50,854
The paint made from the white shells
you once brought me.

258
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:56,109
That is a very long trip, Rapunzel.
Almost three days' time.

259
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,448
I just thought it was a better idea
than the stars.

260
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,912
You'll be all right on your own?

261
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:11,458
I know I'm safe as long as I'm here.

262
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,968
I'll be back in three days' time.

263
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,180
I love you very much, dear.

264
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,474
I love you more.

265
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,643
I love you most.

266
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:52,332
Okay.

267
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:41,005
Is this hair?

268
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:44,926
Struggling... Struggling is pointless.

269
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:53,059
I know why you're here,
and I'm not afraid of you.

270
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,061
What?

271
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:07,282
Who are you?
And how did you find me?

272
00:26:10,744 --> 00:26:14,080
Who are you, and how did you find me?

273
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:21,588
I know not who you are,
nor how I came to find you.

274
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:23,590
But may I just say...

275
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:26,676
Hi.

276
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:31,639
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Rider.

277
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,101
How's your day going?

278
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:40,106
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Rider?

279
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,317
All right, blondie.
Rapunzel.

280
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,068
Gesundheit. Here's the deal.

281
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:47,030
I was in a situation,
gallivanting through the forest.

282
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:49,449
I came across your tower and...

283
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:52,160
Where is my satchel?

284
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:55,663
I've hidden it.
Somewhere you'll never find it.

285
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:00,460
It's in that pot, isn't it?

286
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:09,093
Would you stop that?

287
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:12,055
Now it's hidden
where you'll never find it.

288
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,893
So, what do you want with my hair?
To cut it?

289
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:18,228
What?
Sell it?

290
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:21,981
No! Listen, the only thing
I want to do with your hair

291
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:24,776
is to get out of it, literally.

292
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:28,279
Wait. You don't want my hair?

293
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:30,323
Why on earth would I want your hair?

294
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:33,034
Look, I was being chased,
I saw a tower, I climbed it.

295
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,703
End of story.
You're telling the truth?

296
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,121
Yes.

297
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:51,844
I know. I need someone to take me.

298
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:54,973
I think he's telling the truth, too.

299
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:58,226
He doesn't have fangs.
But what choice do I have?

300
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:04,107
Okay, Flynn Rider,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

301
00:28:04,191 --> 00:28:06,025
Deal?
Look this way.

302
00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:10,405
Do you know what these are?

303
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:13,616
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

304
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:17,620
Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars.

305
00:28:18,706 --> 00:28:21,040
Well, tomorrow evening,

306
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:25,003
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns.

307
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:28,673
You will act as my guide,
take me to these lanterns,

308
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:30,341
and return me home safely.

309
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:34,762
Then, and only then,
will I return your satchel to you.

310
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,055
That is my deal.

311
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,515
Yeah.

312
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:39,976
No can do.

313
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,855
Unfortunately the kingdom and I
aren't exactly simpatico at the moment,

314
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,232
so I won't be taking you anywhere.

315
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:55,992
Something brought you here,
Flynn Rider.

316
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:57,493
Call it what you will,

317
00:28:57,578 --> 00:29:00,413
fate, destiny...
A horse.

318
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:02,832
So I have made the decision
to trust you.

319
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:03,958
A horrible decision, really.

320
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:07,128
But trust me when I tell you this.

321
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:12,550
You can tear this tower apart
brick by brick,

322
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:17,388
but without my help, you will never find
your precious satchel.

323
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:20,266
Let me get this straight.

324
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:23,561
I take you to see the lanterns,
bring you back home,

325
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:25,521
and you'll give me back my satchel?

326
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,106
I promise.

327
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:33,655
And when I promise something,
I never, ever break that promise.

328
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,408
Ever.

329
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:43,039
All right, listen.
I didn't want to have to do this,

330
00:29:43,123 --> 00:29:44,874
but you leave me no choice.

331
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:47,502
Here comes the smoulder.

332
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:59,055
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.

333
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:00,932
Fine! I'll take you to see the lanterns.

334
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,392
Really?

335
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:04,394
Oops.

336
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:06,479
You broke my smoulder.

337
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:13,986
Are you coming, blondie?

338
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:27,583
Look at the world so close
And I'm halfway to it

339
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:32,922
Look at it all so big
Do I even dare

340
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:37,719
Look at me, there at last
I just have to do it

341
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:42,515
Should I? No
Here I go

342
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:19,010
Just smell the grass, the dirt
Just like I dreamed they'd be

343
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:25,767
Just feel that summer breeze
The way it's calling me

344
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:32,774
For, like, the first time ever
I'm completely free

345
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:38,070
I could go running and racing

346
00:31:38,155 --> 00:31:40,072
And dancing and chasing

347
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,160
And leaping and bounding
Hair flying, heart pounding

348
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:48,414
And splashing and reeling
and finally feeling

349
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:55,463
That's when my life begins

350
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:06,098
I can't believe I did this!

351
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:11,103
I can't believe I did this.
I can't believe I did this!

352
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,565
Mother would be so furious.

353
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,027
But that's okay. What she doesn't know
won't kill her, right?

354
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:20,905
Oh, my gosh! This would kill her.

355
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,325
This is so fun!

356
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:27,662
I am a horrible daughter.
I'm going back.

357
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:30,373
I am never going back!

358
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,544
I am a despicable human being!

359
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,173
Best day ever!

360
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,686
You know,
I can't help but notice you seem

361
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,313
a little at war with yourself here.

362
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:57,733
What?
I'm only picking up bits and pieces.

363
00:32:57,818 --> 00:33:01,487
Overprotective mother,
forbidden road trip. This is serious stuff.

364
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:05,199
But let me ease your conscience.
This is part of growing up.

365
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:09,495
A little rebellion, a little adventure,
that's good. Healthy, even.

366
00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:12,498
You think?

367
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,751
I know. You're way overthinking this,
trust me.

368
00:33:15,836 --> 00:33:17,879
Does your mother deserve it? No.

369
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,882
Would this break her heart
and crush her soul? Of course.

370
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:23,050
But you've got to do it.

371
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:25,428
Break her heart?

372
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:28,514
In half.
Crush her soul?

373
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:30,725
Like a grape.

374
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,811
She would be heartbroken. You're right.

375
00:33:33,896 --> 00:33:37,440
I am, aren't I? Oh, bother.

376
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:42,486
All right. I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm letting you out of the deal.

377
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:45,615
What?
That's right, but don't thank me.

378
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:48,910
Let's turn around and get you home.
Here's your pan, here's your frog.

379
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,244
I get back my satchel,

380
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:53,664
you get back a mother-daughter
relationship based on mutual trust,

381
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,959
and voilà,
we part ways as unlikely friends.

382
00:33:57,044 --> 00:34:00,087
No. I am seeing those lanterns.

383
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:03,799
Oh, come on! What is it going to take
for me to get my satchel back?

384
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:05,509
I will use this.

385
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:11,766
Is it ruffians? Thugs?
Have they come for me?

386
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,481
Stay calm. It can probably smell fear.

387
00:34:20,317 --> 00:34:24,487
Sorry. Guess I'm just a little bit jumpy.

388
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:29,283
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians
and thugs, though.

389
00:34:30,077 --> 00:34:32,578
Yeah, that would probably be best.

390
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:36,666
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

391
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:39,001
Where?

392
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:49,887
Don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.

393
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,669
A palace horse.

394
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,630
Where's your rider?

395
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:28,801
Rapunzel!

396
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:39,895
Rapunzel! Let down your hair!

397
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:56,680
I know it's around here somewhere.

398
00:36:57,432 --> 00:37:00,976
Ah, there it is! The Snuggly Duckling.

399
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,979
Don't worry. Very quaint place.
Perfect for you.

400
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:07,358
Don't want you scaring and giving up
on this whole endeavour now, do we?

401
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:10,903
Well, I do like ducklings.
Yay!

402
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,865
Garçon, your finest table, please!

403
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:25,000
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

404
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,628
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?

405
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:31,423
To me, it's part man-smell and the other
part is really bad man-smell.

406
00:37:31,508 --> 00:37:34,301
I don't know why, but overall it smells
like the colour brown. Your thoughts?

407
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:38,138
That's a lot of hair.

408
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,558
She's growing it out.
Is that blood in your moustache?

409
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:43,310
Goldie, look at all the blood
in his moustache!

410
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:45,479
Good sir, that's a lot of blood!

411
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:51,193
You don't look so good, blondie. Maybe
we should get you home, call it a day.

412
00:37:51,278 --> 00:37:54,196
Probably better off.
This is a five-star joint.

413
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:57,491
If you can't handle this place, maybe
you should be back in your tower.

414
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:00,160
Is this you?

415
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,124
Now they're just being mean.
It's him, all right.

416
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:09,295
Greno, go find some guards.

417
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:12,756
That reward
is going to buy me a new hook.

418
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:16,302
I could use the money.
What about me? I'm broke!

419
00:38:16,386 --> 00:38:17,386
Get back!

420
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:18,762
Mine!
Ruffians, stop!

421
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:21,724
We can work this out!
Leave him alone!

422
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:23,017
Gentlemen, please!

423
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:26,478
Give me back my guide! Ruffians!

424
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:36,405
Not the nose! Not the nose!

425
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:41,201
Put him down!

426
00:38:43,997 --> 00:38:47,916
I don't know where I am, and I need him
to take me to see the lanterns

427
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:50,919
because I've been dreaming about them
my entire life!

428
00:38:51,004 --> 00:38:55,966
Find your humanity!
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

429
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:10,689
I had a dream once.

430
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:24,078
I'm malicious, mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy

431
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:27,623
And violence-wise
my hands are not the cleanest

432
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:31,919
But despite my evil look
And my temper and my hook

433
00:39:32,462 --> 00:39:35,506
I've always yearned
to be a concert pianist

434
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:39,760
Can't you see me on the stage
performing Mozart

435
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,971
Tickling the ivories till they gleam

436
00:39:43,056 --> 00:39:46,975
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show tune medley

437
00:39:47,977 --> 00:39:48,977
Thank you!

438
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:51,814
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

439
00:39:51,898 --> 00:39:55,275
He's got a dream
He's got a dream

440
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,321
See, I ain't as cruel and vicious
as I seem

441
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:03,075
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers

442
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,036
Like everybody else I've got a dream

443
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,629
I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes

444
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:18,841
And let's not even mention
my complexion

445
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:22,720
But despite my extra toes
And my goitre and my nose

446
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,098
I really want to make a love connection

447
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:29,893
Can't you see me
with a special little lady?

448
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:33,313
Rowing in a rowboat down the stream

449
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:37,192
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover not a fighter

450
00:40:37,277 --> 00:40:40,195
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

451
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,116
I've got a dream
He's got a dream

452
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,536
And I know one day
romance will reign supreme

453
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,538
Though my face
leaves people screaming

454
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:51,540
There's a child behind it dreaming

455
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:54,793
Like everybody else, I've got a dream

456
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:58,464
Thor would like to quit and be a florist

457
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:02,134
Gunther does interior design

458
00:41:02,218 --> 00:41:05,804
Ulf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime

459
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:09,349
Bruiser knits, Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows

460
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:15,147
And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns

461
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:18,650
What about you?
I'm sorry, me?

462
00:41:18,735 --> 00:41:19,985
What's your dream?

463
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:22,988
No, no, no. Sorry, boys. I don't sing.

464
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,241
I have dreams like you
No, really

465
00:41:26,326 --> 00:41:27,910
Just much less touchy-feely

466
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:31,038
They mainly happen
somewhere warm and sunny

467
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,750
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone

468
00:41:35,835 --> 00:41:38,796
Surrounded by enormous
piles of money

469
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,591
I've got a dream
She's got a dream

470
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:45,969
I just want to see
the floating lanterns gleam

471
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:50,390
And with every passing hour
I'm so glad I left my tower

472
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:53,310
Like all you lovely folks
I've got a dream

473
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:55,103
She's got a dream
He's got a dream

474
00:41:55,188 --> 00:41:57,022
They've got a dream
We've got a dream

475
00:41:57,106 --> 00:42:00,317
So our differences
ain't really that extreme

476
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:04,488
We're one big team

477
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:06,406
Call us brutal
Sick

478
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,951
Sadistic
And grotesquely optimistic

479
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:11,286
'Cause way down deep inside
we've got a dream

480
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:14,206
I've got a dream
I've got a dream

481
00:42:17,544 --> 00:42:23,048
Yes, way down deep inside
I've got a dream

482
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:32,975
I found the guards!

483
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:37,729
Where's Rider? Where is he?

484
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,315
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him.

485
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,442
Turn the place upside down
if you have to!

486
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:01,086
Go. Live your dream.

487
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:04,006
I will.
Your dream stinks.

488
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,883
I was talking to her.

489
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:09,511
Thanks for everything.

490
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:15,684
I believe
this is the man you're looking for.

491
00:43:15,768 --> 00:43:17,644
You got me!

492
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:20,439
Sir, there's no sign of Rider.

493
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,402
Maximus!

494
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:35,287
What's he doing?

495
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:46,757
A passage! Come on, men. Let's go.

496
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:50,552
Conli! Make sure those boys
don't get away.

497
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,308
Play it safe

498
00:43:58,019 --> 00:43:59,811
or go get the crown?

499
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,740
I got a dream
I got some dreams

500
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:16,328
Somebody get me a glass!

501
00:44:16,412 --> 00:44:20,165
Because I just found me
a tall drink of water.

502
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,001
Oh, stop it, you big lug.

503
00:44:24,837 --> 00:44:26,755
Where does that tunnel let out?

504
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:28,256
Knife!

505
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:35,597
I didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty impressive.

506
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:36,973
I know!

507
00:44:38,685 --> 00:44:40,143
I know.

508
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:46,483
So... Flynn? Where are you from?

509
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:49,027
Whoa! Sorry, blondie,
I don't do back-story.

510
00:44:49,112 --> 00:44:51,697
However, I am becoming
very interested in yours.

511
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:54,366
I know I'm not supposed
to mention the hair.

512
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,992
Nope.
Or the mother.

513
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:58,704
Uh-uh.
I'm too scared to ask about the frog.

514
00:44:58,871 --> 00:45:00,247
Chameleon.
Nuance.

515
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,043
Here's my question, though,
if you want to see the lanterns so badly

516
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:07,045
why haven't you gone before?

517
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:10,882
Well...

518
00:45:18,057 --> 00:45:19,182
Flynn?

519
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:20,934
Rider?

520
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,978
Run. Run!

521
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:43,623
Who's that?
They don't like me.

522
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:46,960
Who's that?
They don't like me either.

523
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,128
Who's that?

524
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,173
Let's assume that everyone in here
doesn't like me.

525
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:52,424
Here.

526
00:46:01,434 --> 00:46:03,518
I waited a long time for this.

527
00:46:12,945 --> 00:46:16,615
Oh, mama!
I have got to get me one of these!

528
00:46:24,957 --> 00:46:29,294
You should know that this
is the strangest thing I've ever done!

529
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,468
How about two out of three?

530
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,643
Flynn, look out!

531
00:46:49,857 --> 00:46:51,983
You should see your faces,
because you look...

532
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:54,486
...ridiculous.

533
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:04,329
Come on, blondie! Jump!

534
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:36,338
It's no use. I can't see anything.

535
00:48:41,761 --> 00:48:44,930
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch-black down there.

536
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,814
This is all my fault.

537
00:48:56,525 --> 00:48:59,611
She was right.
I never should have done this.

538
00:49:05,785 --> 00:49:07,869
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

539
00:49:15,628 --> 00:49:16,836
Eugene.

540
00:49:18,297 --> 00:49:19,422
What?

541
00:49:20,466 --> 00:49:22,968
My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert.

542
00:49:24,553 --> 00:49:26,638
Someone might as well know.

543
00:49:29,475 --> 00:49:32,268
I have magic hair
that glows when I sing.

544
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:34,145
What?

545
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:40,068
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing!

546
00:49:41,529 --> 00:49:44,364
Flower gleam and glow
Let your power shine

547
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:36,624
We made it.

548
00:50:36,709 --> 00:50:40,170
Her hair glows.
We're alive. I'm alive!

549
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:43,840
I didn't see that coming.
The hair actually glows.

550
00:50:43,924 --> 00:50:45,550
Why does her hair glow?
Eugene!

551
00:50:45,634 --> 00:50:46,634
What?

552
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,638
It doesn't just glow.

553
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:55,101
Why is he smiling at me?

554
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:22,087
I'll kill him. I'll kill that Rider!

555
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:27,592
We'll cut him off at the kingdom
and get back the crown. Come on!

556
00:51:28,844 --> 00:51:30,261
Or...

557
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:34,974
Perhaps you want to stop
acting like wild dogs

558
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:38,436
chasing their tails
and think for a moment.

559
00:51:40,648 --> 00:51:43,066
Oh, please, there's no need for that.

560
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:52,200
Well, if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

561
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:55,286
I was going to offer you something
worth 1,000 crowns.

562
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:56,996
Would have made you
rich beyond belief,

563
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,873
and that wasn't even the best part.

564
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:02,961
Oh, well. C'est la vie. Enjoy your crown!

565
00:52:04,463 --> 00:52:06,131
What's the best part?

566
00:52:06,632 --> 00:52:11,594
It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider.

567
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,436
You're being strangely cryptic

568
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:23,815
as you wrap your magic hair
around my injured hand.

569
00:52:24,483 --> 00:52:25,817
Sorry.

570
00:52:26,986 --> 00:52:31,030
Just don't... Don't freak out.

571
00:52:36,662 --> 00:52:40,331
Flower, gleam and glow

572
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,960
Let your power shine

573
00:52:45,337 --> 00:52:48,715
Make the clock reverse

574
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:52,552
Bring back what once was mine

575
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,806
Heal what has been hurt

576
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,102
Change the Fates' design

577
00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:05,440
Save what has been lost

578
00:53:05,524 --> 00:53:08,693
Bring back what once was mine

579
00:53:09,361 --> 00:53:14,115
What once was mine

580
00:53:28,464 --> 00:53:30,465
Please don't freak out!

581
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:35,678
I'm not freaking out.
Are you freaking out?

582
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:39,015
I'm just interested in your hair
and the magical qualities it possesses.

583
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,893
How long has it been
doing that exactly?

584
00:53:43,145 --> 00:53:45,480
Forever, I guess.

585
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:49,651
Mother says when I was a baby,
people tried to cut it.

586
00:53:49,735 --> 00:53:51,653
They wanted to take it for themselves.

587
00:53:52,238 --> 00:53:57,158
But once it's cut,
it turns brown and loses its power.

588
00:53:57,993 --> 00:54:01,120
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

589
00:54:02,081 --> 00:54:04,499
That's why Mother never let me...

590
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,922
That's why I never left and...

591
00:54:14,343 --> 00:54:16,386
You never left that tower.

592
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:22,267
And you're still going to go back?

593
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,811
No! Yes.

594
00:54:26,981 --> 00:54:28,940
It's complicated.

595
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:42,453
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

596
00:54:42,663 --> 00:54:44,580
Ah, yeah. Well...

597
00:54:44,665 --> 00:54:48,001
I'll spare you the sob story
of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert.

598
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:51,379
It's a little bit of a downer.

599
00:54:57,636 --> 00:55:01,639
There was this book I used to read
every night to all the younger kids.

600
00:55:01,724 --> 00:55:03,391
The Tales of Flynnagan Rider.

601
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:08,062
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man
alive, not bad with the ladies either.

602
00:55:08,147 --> 00:55:10,732
Not that he'd ever brag about it,
of course.

603
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,026
Was he a thief, too?

604
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:16,321
Well, no.

605
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:19,824
He had enough money to do anything
that he wanted to do.

606
00:55:19,908 --> 00:55:21,492
He could go anywhere
that he wanted to go.

607
00:55:22,244 --> 00:55:26,247
And for a kid with nothing,
I don't know, I...

608
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:29,667
Just seemed like the better option.

609
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:33,296
You can't tell anyone about this, okay?

610
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:35,840
It could ruin my whole reputation.

611
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:38,509
We wouldn't want that.

612
00:55:38,594 --> 00:55:41,179
A fake reputation is all a man has.

613
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:50,980
Well, I should...

614
00:55:52,191 --> 00:55:54,525
I should get some more firewood.

615
00:55:57,196 --> 00:56:02,867
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than Flynn Rider.

616
00:56:06,038 --> 00:56:09,207
Then you'd be the first. But thank you.

617
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:22,303
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

618
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:23,763
Mother?

619
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,348
Hello, dear.

620
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:29,769
How did you find me?

621
00:56:30,062 --> 00:56:31,938
It was easy, really.

622
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:36,401
I just listened for the sound of complete
and utter betrayal and followed that.

623
00:56:39,113 --> 00:56:42,990
We're going home. Now.
You don't understand.

624
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:47,495
I've been on this incredible journey,
and I've seen and learned so much.

625
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:49,580
I even met someone.

626
00:56:49,665 --> 00:56:52,750
Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud.
Come on.

627
00:56:53,085 --> 00:56:55,753
Mother, wait. I think...

628
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:58,965
I think he likes me.

629
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:01,926
Likes you?
Please, Rapunzel, that's demented!

630
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:05,138
This is why you never should have left

631
00:57:06,014 --> 00:57:09,183
Dear, this whole romance
that you've invented

632
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:13,813
Just proves you're too naive to be here

633
00:57:14,356 --> 00:57:17,233
Why would he like you?
Come on now, really

634
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,945
Look at you!
You think that he's impressed?

635
00:57:21,488 --> 00:57:25,241
Don't be a dummy, come with Mummy

636
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,368
Mother...

637
00:57:27,453 --> 00:57:28,786
No!

638
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:30,997
No?

639
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:35,626
Oh, I see how it is

640
00:57:37,963 --> 00:57:41,716
Rapunzel knows best
Rapunzel's so mature now

641
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,802
Such a clever grown-up miss

642
00:57:45,304 --> 00:57:48,890
Rapunzel knows best
Fine, if you're so sure now

643
00:57:48,974 --> 00:57:52,351
Go ahead, then give him this!
How did you...

644
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:55,938
This is why he's here
Don't let him deceive you

645
00:57:56,023 --> 00:57:58,232
Give it to him, watch, you'll see

646
00:57:58,317 --> 00:57:59,275
I will!

647
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,612
Trust me, my dear
That's how fast he'll leave you

648
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:06,365
I won't say I told you so

649
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,828
No, Rapunzel knows best
So, if he's such a dreamboat

650
00:58:10,913 --> 00:58:13,331
Go and put him to the test

651
00:58:13,415 --> 00:58:14,415
Mother, wait!

652
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:20,087
If he's lying, don't come crying

653
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:25,885
Mother knows best

654
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,186
So, can I ask you something?

655
00:58:36,188 --> 00:58:39,524
Is there any chance that I'm going to get
super strength in my hand?

656
00:58:39,608 --> 00:58:43,069
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.

657
00:58:44,112 --> 00:58:45,571
Hey, you all right?

658
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:51,827
Sorry, yes. Just lost in thought, I guess.

659
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:55,623
Here's the thing,

660
00:58:55,707 --> 00:58:59,001
superhuman good looks,
I've always had them. Born with it.

661
00:58:59,086 --> 00:59:03,297
But superhuman strength. Can you
imagine the possibilities of this?

662
00:59:07,553 --> 00:59:09,554
Patience, boys.

663
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:14,350
All good things to those who wait.

664
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:36,247
Well, I hope you're here to apologise.

665
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:41,836
No, put me down. Stop it! No!

666
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,921
Let me go!

667
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:46,424
Give me him!

668
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:48,509
Stop, stop, stop!

669
00:59:58,604 --> 01:00:00,605
Easy, boy. Easy! Settle down.

670
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:04,191
Easy, boy. Easy.

671
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:06,235
Easy.

672
01:00:07,946 --> 01:00:09,572
That's it.

673
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:13,993
Now sit.

674
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:16,912
Sit!

675
01:00:17,456 --> 01:00:19,457
What?
Now drop the boot.

676
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,292
Drop it.

677
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:28,341
You're such a good boy! Yes, you are!

678
01:00:29,885 --> 01:00:33,471
You all tired from chasing this bad man
all over the place?

679
01:00:33,555 --> 01:00:37,433
Excuse me?
Nobody appreciates you, do they?

680
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:38,684
Do they?

681
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:40,811
Oh, come on. He's a bad horse!

682
01:00:40,896 --> 01:00:43,522
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.

683
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:46,108
Isn't that right...

684
01:00:46,652 --> 01:00:48,152
Maximus?

685
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:51,238
You've got to be kidding me.

686
01:00:51,323 --> 01:00:56,035
Look. Today is kind of
the biggest day of my life,

687
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:00,498
and the thing is,
I need you not to get him arrested.

688
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:02,458
Just for 24 hours,

689
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:06,379
and then you can chase each other
to your heart's content.

690
01:01:11,093 --> 01:01:14,637
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

691
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:08,065
Excuse me. Sorry.

692
01:02:30,922 --> 01:02:32,840
Thank you!

693
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:50,357
It's for the lost princess.

694
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,563
To the boats!

695
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:22,867
Hey, Max!

696
01:04:26,246 --> 01:04:29,123
What? I bought them.

697
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:33,460
Most of them.

698
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,755
Where are we going?

699
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,718
Best day of your life?
I figured you should have a decent seat.

700
01:04:59,237 --> 01:05:00,613
You okay?

701
01:05:01,448 --> 01:05:03,073
I'm terrified.

702
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:05,242
Why?

703
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:10,331
I've been looking out a window
for 18 years,

704
01:05:10,415 --> 01:05:15,252
dreaming about what it might feel like
when those lights rise in the sky.

705
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:20,215
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

706
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:24,136
It will be.

707
01:05:25,597 --> 01:05:30,225
And what if it is? What do I do then?

708
01:05:30,685 --> 01:05:35,606
That's the good part, I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.

709
01:07:09,284 --> 01:07:14,329
All those days
watching from the windows

710
01:07:14,414 --> 01:07:18,042
All those years, outside looking in

711
01:07:18,877 --> 01:07:23,672
All that time, never even knowing

712
01:07:23,757 --> 01:07:28,552
Just how blind I've been

713
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:33,724
Now I'm here, blinking in the starlight

714
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:38,145
Now I'm here, suddenly I see

715
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:43,192
Standing here, it's, oh, so clear

716
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:47,863
I'm where I'm meant to be

717
01:07:47,947 --> 01:07:52,242
And at last I see the light

718
01:07:52,577 --> 01:07:56,580
And it's like the fog has lifted

719
01:07:57,248 --> 01:08:01,835
And at last I see the light

720
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,714
And it's like the sky is new

721
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:11,178
And it's warm and real and bright

722
01:08:11,262 --> 01:08:16,600
And the world has somehow shifted

723
01:08:19,604 --> 01:08:24,525
All at once, everything looks different

724
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:28,904
Now that I see you

725
01:08:35,703 --> 01:08:38,205
I have something for you, too.

726
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,792
I should have given it to you before,
but I was just scared.

727
01:08:42,127 --> 01:08:46,713
And the thing is, I'm not scared
any more. You know what I mean?

728
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,801
I'm starting to.

729
01:08:54,848 --> 01:08:59,393
All those days
chasing down a daydream

730
01:08:59,811 --> 01:09:03,605
All those years, living in a blur

731
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:08,735
All that time, never truly seeing

732
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:12,489
Things the way they were

733
01:09:13,575 --> 01:09:18,412
Now she's here, shining in the starlight

734
01:09:18,496 --> 01:09:22,499
Now she's here, suddenly I know

735
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:27,588
If she's here, it's crystal clear

736
01:09:27,672 --> 01:09:31,758
I'm where I'm meant to go

737
01:09:31,843 --> 01:09:36,430
And at last I see the light

738
01:09:36,514 --> 01:09:40,642
And it's like the fog has lifted

739
01:09:40,727 --> 01:09:45,063
And at last I see the light

740
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:49,276
And it's like the sky is new

741
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:54,156
And it's warm and real and bright

742
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:59,703
And the world has somehow shifted

743
01:10:02,749 --> 01:10:07,794
All at once, everything is different

744
01:10:07,879 --> 01:10:13,383
Now that I see you

745
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:19,014
Now that I...

746
01:10:20,058 --> 01:10:23,435
see you

747
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:45,749
Is everything okay?

748
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,919
Oh, yes.

749
01:10:49,837 --> 01:10:52,673
Yes, of course. I just...

750
01:10:58,429 --> 01:11:00,764
I'm sorry. Everything is fine.

751
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:03,392
There's just something
I have to take care of.

752
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:07,354
Okay.

753
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:10,899
I'll be right back.

754
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:18,949
It's all right, Pascal.

755
01:11:26,332 --> 01:11:28,208
There you are!

756
01:11:28,293 --> 01:11:30,877
I've been searching everywhere
for you guys since we got separated.

757
01:11:30,962 --> 01:11:35,215
The sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
Got to be excited about that.

758
01:11:38,928 --> 01:11:41,680
Anyhow, I just wanted to say
I shouldn't have split.

759
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:47,227
The crown is all yours. I'll miss you,
but I think it's for the best.

760
01:11:48,896 --> 01:11:52,316
Holding out on us again, eh, Rider?

761
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:55,694
What?
We heard you found something.

762
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,655
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

763
01:11:59,657 --> 01:12:02,492
We want her instead.

764
01:12:12,754 --> 01:12:16,006
I was starting to think you ran off
with the crown and left me.

765
01:12:23,056 --> 01:12:24,681
He did.

766
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,018
What? No. He wouldn't.

767
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:30,645
See for yourself.

768
01:12:35,526 --> 01:12:36,610
Eugene?

769
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:41,239
Eugene!

770
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:48,455
A fair trade. A crown
for the girl with the magic hair.

771
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:53,460
How much do you think someone would
pay to stay young and healthy forever?

772
01:12:53,544 --> 01:12:56,463
No. Please. No!

773
01:13:06,057 --> 01:13:07,349
Rapunzel!

774
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,477
Mother?

775
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:17,859
Oh, my precious girl!

776
01:13:18,736 --> 01:13:19,986
Mother.

777
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,906
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

778
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:26,535
How did you...
I was so worried about you, dear.

779
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:30,163
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you and...

780
01:13:30,248 --> 01:13:32,916
Oh, my. Let's go before they come to!

781
01:14:03,114 --> 01:14:07,075
You were right, Mother.
You were right about everything.

782
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:11,621
I know, darling. I know.

783
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:26,553
Look!

784
01:14:27,138 --> 01:14:28,513
The crown!

785
01:14:34,812 --> 01:14:37,564
No! Wait, guys!

786
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,507
Let's get this over with, Rider.

787
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:06,927
Where are we going?

788
01:15:14,769 --> 01:15:17,521
There. It never happened.

789
01:15:19,774 --> 01:15:24,694
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazelnut soup.

790
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:34,496
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you what was out there.

791
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:39,626
The world is dark and selfish and cruel.

792
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,712
If it finds
even the slightest ray of sunshine,

793
01:15:43,631 --> 01:15:45,382
it destroys it.

794
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,278
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!

795
01:17:30,363 --> 01:17:33,198
It wasn't us! It was the old lady!

796
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:34,532
Old lady?

797
01:17:35,993 --> 01:17:38,161
Wait. No! Wait!

798
01:17:38,245 --> 01:17:41,164
You don't understand!
She's in trouble! Wait!

799
01:17:44,377 --> 01:17:46,169
What's going on up there?

800
01:17:50,341 --> 01:17:52,008
Are you all right?

801
01:17:53,344 --> 01:17:54,886
I'm the lost princess.

802
01:17:55,554 --> 01:17:58,765
Please speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

803
01:17:58,849 --> 01:18:03,436
I am the lost princess. Aren't I?

804
01:18:05,606 --> 01:18:07,857
Did I mumble, Mother?

805
01:18:09,026 --> 01:18:11,528
Or should I even call you that?

806
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,615
Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

807
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,410
Why would you ask
such a ridiculous question?

808
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:21,955
It was you! It was all you!

809
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:27,544
Everything I did was to protect you.

810
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:34,718
I've spent my entire life hiding from
people who would use me for my power

811
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,722
when I should have been hiding
from you!

812
01:18:38,806 --> 01:18:42,100
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.

813
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:44,060
What did you do to him?

814
01:18:44,562 --> 01:18:47,814
That criminal is to be hanged
for his crimes.

815
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:51,317
No.
Now, now, it's all right.

816
01:18:51,402 --> 01:18:55,989
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.

817
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:59,909
No! You were wrong about the world.

818
01:19:00,453 --> 01:19:02,954
And you were wrong about me!

819
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:07,083
And I will never
let you use my hair again!

820
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:18,678
You want me to be the bad guy?

821
01:19:18,763 --> 01:19:22,599
Fine, now I'm the bad guy.

822
01:19:36,781 --> 01:19:38,364
What's this?

823
01:19:38,449 --> 01:19:40,283
Open up!

824
01:19:41,327 --> 01:19:43,369
What's the password?
What?

825
01:19:43,454 --> 01:19:45,705
Nope.
Open this door!

826
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:47,624
Not even close!

827
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:50,543
You have three seconds! One...

828
01:19:51,462 --> 01:19:52,837
Two...

829
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:55,799
Three.

830
01:20:01,347 --> 01:20:03,640
Frying pans! Who knew, right?

831
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:34,420
Head down.
Head down.

832
01:20:34,505 --> 01:20:35,588
Arms in.
Arms in.

833
01:20:35,673 --> 01:20:37,340
Knees apart.
Knees apart. Knees apart?

834
01:20:38,509 --> 01:20:40,343
Why do I need
to keep my knees apart...

835
01:20:48,519 --> 01:20:51,729
Max! You brought them here?

836
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:54,983
Thank you.

837
01:20:56,402 --> 01:20:59,028
No, really. Thank you.

838
01:21:00,948 --> 01:21:02,282
I feel maybe this whole time,

839
01:21:02,366 --> 01:21:04,284
we've just been misunderstanding
one another,

840
01:21:04,368 --> 01:21:06,077
and we're really just...

841
01:21:06,453 --> 01:21:07,745
You're right, we should go.

842
01:21:15,379 --> 01:21:16,421
Max?

843
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:33,354
Okay, Max.
Let's see how fast you can run.

844
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:53,833
Rapunzel?

845
01:21:55,836 --> 01:21:57,420
Rapunzel, let down your hair!

846
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:16,105
Rapunzel,
I thought I'd never see you again.

847
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,158
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.

848
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:31,579
Oh, don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.

849
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:34,874
And as for us...

850
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:40,838
We are going where no one
will ever find you again.

851
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:48,596
Rapunzel, really!

852
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:53,059
Enough already! Stop fighting me!

853
01:22:53,686 --> 01:22:55,728
No! I won't stop!

854
01:22:55,813 --> 01:22:59,023
For every minute of the rest of my life,
I will fight!

855
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:02,986
I will never stop trying
to get away from you!

856
01:23:05,406 --> 01:23:09,951
But if you let me save him,
I will go with you.

857
01:23:10,703 --> 01:23:13,663
No! No, Rapunzel.

858
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:17,792
I'll never run. I'll never try to escape.

859
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:21,462
Just let me heal him
and you and I will be together,

860
01:23:21,547 --> 01:23:23,589
forever, just like you want.

861
01:23:23,674 --> 01:23:25,675
Everything will be the way it was.

862
01:23:27,011 --> 01:23:28,136
I promise.

863
01:23:29,054 --> 01:23:30,847
Just like you want.

864
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:37,186
Just let me heal him.

865
01:23:42,735 --> 01:23:46,112
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

866
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:58,750
I'm so sorry.
Everything is going to be okay, though.

867
01:23:58,834 --> 01:23:59,834
No, Rapunzel.

868
01:23:59,918 --> 01:24:03,296
I promise. You have to trust me.
Come on. Just breathe.

869
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:05,048
I can't let you do this.

870
01:24:05,716 --> 01:24:07,842
And I can't let you die.

871
01:24:08,385 --> 01:24:12,055
But if you do then you will die.

872
01:24:12,139 --> 01:24:15,850
Hey. It's going to be all right.

873
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:24,275
Wait.

874
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:34,452
Eugene...

875
01:24:35,412 --> 01:24:36,579
No!

876
01:24:44,755 --> 01:24:48,382
What have you done?
What have you done?

877
01:25:27,297 --> 01:25:29,173
No, no, no. Eugene.

878
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:36,305
No! Look at me. I'm right here.
Don't go. Stay with me.

879
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:39,976
Flower, gleam and glow
Let your power shine

880
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,354
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine

881
01:25:44,565 --> 01:25:45,648
What?

882
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:51,195
You were my new dream.

883
01:25:54,491 --> 01:25:56,242
And you were mine.

884
01:26:22,603 --> 01:26:26,105
Heal what has been hurt

885
01:26:27,524 --> 01:26:31,152
Change the Fates' design

886
01:26:32,196 --> 01:26:35,281
Save what has been lost

887
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:40,745
Bring back what once was mine

888
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:46,167
What once was mine

889
01:27:43,642 --> 01:27:45,101
Rapunzel?

890
01:27:46,103 --> 01:27:47,478
Eugene?

891
01:27:49,523 --> 01:27:52,483
Did I ever tell you
I've got a thing for brunettes?

892
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:38,714
Well, you can imagine
what happened next.

893
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:44,762
The kingdom rejoiced,
for their lost princess had returned.

894
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:49,558
The party lasted an entire week, and
honestly I don't remember most of it.

895
01:29:50,394 --> 01:29:52,186
Dreams came true all over the place.

896
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:55,564
That guy went on to become the most
famous concert pianist in the world,

897
01:29:55,649 --> 01:29:57,316
if you can believe it!

898
01:29:58,902 --> 01:30:02,279
And this guy?
He eventually found true love.

899
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:07,410
As for this guy, I assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.

900
01:30:09,621 --> 01:30:10,704
Thanks to Maximus,

901
01:30:10,789 --> 01:30:13,874
crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost overnight.

902
01:30:15,419 --> 01:30:17,461
As did most of the apples.

903
01:30:19,214 --> 01:30:22,091
Pascal never changed.

904
01:30:26,179 --> 01:30:30,182
At last Rapunzel was home.
And she finally had a real family.

905
01:30:31,935 --> 01:30:34,520
She was a princess worth waiting for.

906
01:30:34,604 --> 01:30:38,065
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom

907
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:39,608
that her parents did before her.

908
01:30:40,944 --> 01:30:44,071
And, as for me,
I started going by Eugene again,

909
01:30:44,156 --> 01:30:46,282
stopped thieving
and turned it all around.

910
01:30:46,366 --> 01:30:48,909
But I know what the big question is.

911
01:30:48,994 --> 01:30:51,162
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?

912
01:30:51,246 --> 01:30:52,371
I'm pleased to tell you

913
01:30:52,456 --> 01:30:56,834
that after years and years
of asking and asking and asking...

914
01:30:58,962 --> 01:31:00,838
I finally said yes.

915
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:05,217
Eugene.
All right, I asked her.

916
01:31:05,302 --> 01:31:07,761
And we're living happily ever after.

917
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:21,859
Yes, we are.

918
01:40:14,726 --> 01:40:15,726
(ENDING)

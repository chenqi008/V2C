1
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,682
With every sun comes a new day.
A new beginning.

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,322
A hope that things will be better today
than they were yesterday.

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,171
But not for me.
My name is Eep.

4
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,449
And this is my family, the Croods.

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,602
If you weren't clued in already by the
animal skins

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,251
and sloping foreheads,
we're cavemen.

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,003
Most days we spend in our cave,
in the dark.

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,688
Night after night, day after day.

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,890
Yep, home sweet home.

10
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,841
When we did go out, we struggled to
find food in a harsh and hostile world.

11
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,801
And I struggled to survive my family.

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,963
We were the last ones around.
There used to be neighbors.

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,686
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,810
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,207
The Erfs, mosquito bite.

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,046
Throgs, common cold.

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,965
And the Croods, that's us.

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,806
The Croods made it, because of my dad.

19
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,567
He was strong,
and he followed the rules.

20
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,529
The ones painted on the cave walls.

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,206
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,689
Going out at night is bad.
Basically, anything fun is bad.

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,842
Welcome to my world.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,404
But this is a story about how
all that changed in an instant.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,723
Because what we didn't know
was that our world...

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,406
was about to come to an end.

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,851
And there were no rules on our
cave walls to prepare us for that.

28
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,967
You are supposed to wait
for my signal. Eep?

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,205
Boo.

30
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,607
Ow! No!

31
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,969
We've been in that cave forever.

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,441
Three days is not forever.

33
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,045
It is with this family.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,603
Eep, would you come down here?
You're being so dramatic.

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,491
No, Sandy, come back here.

36
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,526
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.

37
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,286
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
and you can give the signal.

38
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,130
No, I mean, you're already out now.

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,964
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,327
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

41
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,121
But if you don't give the signal,
how do I know you're my dad?

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,970
The signal isn't so you know it's me.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,970
It's so you know I wasn't eaten
by an animal.

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,051
Then why is the signal an animal noise?
Doesn't that just confuse things?

45
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,569
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the signal.

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,084
Mom, we're ready to leave.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,445
Mom?

48
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,887
Still alive.

49
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,451
It's still early.

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,331
And you're still fat.

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,642
Breakfast formation!

52
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,248
I want to see some real caveman action
out there. We do this fast.

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,085
We do this loud.
We do this as a family.

54
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,642
And never not be afraid!

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,448
Yay, breakfast.

56
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,561
Who's up?

57
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,607
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.

58
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,649
Heads!

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,569
Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.

60
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,842
Okay. Thunk--

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,411
Go.

62
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,246
Come on, Thunk.

63
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,562
Way to go.
Take it to the cave.

64
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,044
Release the baby!

65
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,249
Get them, Sandy! Go!

66
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,885
Get them, Mom!

67
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,287
Old lady down!
Eep, avenge me!

68
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,040
Thanks.

69
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,526
Eep!

70
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,409
Heads up!

71
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,089
Hey Dad, can we eat now?

72
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,282
Just wait till we get home.

73
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,647
Eep, put on the brakes.

74
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,081
Eep!

75
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,690
Who is hungry?
-All right! Good one, Dad.

76
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,286
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

77
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,447
Sorry, Dad.
-Looks like fast food tonight.

78
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,963
That's all right. I ate last week.

79
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,162
Two knuckle warning!

80
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,840
Come on, Croods. Go, go.

81
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,124
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death.
We know this.

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
The moon is full. Bath night.

83
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,041
Run for your life!
You too, Mom.

84
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,441
I don't want to lose
my protective layer.

85
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,204
Mom, you've got ants.

86
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,651
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

87
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,366
Is she still out there?

88
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,682
You know she hates the cave, Grug.

89
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,251
Please come back tomorrow.

90
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,882
How could she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.

91
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,203
It is a little dark, Grug.

92
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,725
It's not that dark.

93
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,241
Eep!

94
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,120
Eep?

95
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,203
Come on, I have to close the cave.

96
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,241
Eep!

97
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,364
Okay, Okay

98
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,090
Come on.

99
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,161
Eep! Come down!

100
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,851
That was too close.
I was watching. I was fine.

101
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,241
What were you doing up there, Eep?
I don't know.

102
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,050
What were you looking for?
Nothing.

103
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,850
Then why did you go up there?
I don't know.

104
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,644
Why don't you know?

105
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,370
Stop looking for things.

106
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,491
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.
Never not be afraid.

107
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,048
What is the point of all this?

108
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,726
What was that?

109
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,804
Why are we here?
What are we doing this for?

110
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,088
No one said survival was fun.

111
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,446
Nothing is fun.

112
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,449
Would you come down here?
Grug.

113
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,601
EeP
_Gru9

114
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,681
Yes.
Off!

115
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,364
Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to
Off.

116
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,687
I just don't see why
she needs her own ledge, that's all.

117
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,729
That's what this is about.
She's working through some things...

118
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,961
and she needs her own space.

119
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,964
What things?
How long is this going to take?

120
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,811
Really?
She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!

121
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,485
See? She's listening.

122
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,206
If she wants to survive,
she has to follow our rules.

123
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,642
How about a story?
Eep loves those.

124
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,002
That's a good ide--
How about a story, huh?

125
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,844
Yeah, tell us a story.

126
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,002
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

127
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,050
Eep, your old favorite.

128
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,328
I haven't played with that thing in years.

129
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,171
Tonight we'll hear the story
of Krispy Bear.

130
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,363
A long time ago,
this little bear was alive.

131
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,365
She was alive
because she listened to her father...

132
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,763
and lived her life in routine
and darkness and terror.

133
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,729
So she was happy.

134
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,524
But Krispy had one terrible problem.

135
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,685
She was filled with... curiosity.

136
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,569
G rug.
-Yes. yes.

137
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,883
And one day, while she was in a tree...

138
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,806
the curious little bear
wanted to climb to the top.

139
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,201
And no sooner than
she climbed to the top...

140
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,206
she saw something new and died!

141
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,203
Just like that?
-Yes!

142
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,570
Her last moments of terror
still frozen on her face.

143
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,210
Same ending as every day.

144
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,880
I get it, Dad. I will never do
anything new or different.

145
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,326
Good man, Thunk.

146
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,564
All right, everyone
sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.

147
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,161
Air.

148
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,810
You talk.

149
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,849
I'm a person, like you.

150
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,527
Sort of like you.

151
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,601
Okay, Okay-

152
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,841
Hey, hey, hey!

153
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,365
Would you mind not--

154
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,206
That tickles.

155
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,964
Hey, hey, hey!

156
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,921
Quiet!

157
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,202
I'm not supposed to be out here.

158
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,001
Eep is gone.

159
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,207
What? Grug!

160
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,486
Stay in the cave.

161
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,848
Wow. You are really strong.

162
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,485
Hey! No! It's mine.

163
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,369
Please! Wait.
-No!

164
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,249
It's dying! I can fix it!
No! I caught it!

165
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,765
Please! Please.

166
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,206
I hate the dark.

167
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,969
Come on, come on, come on.

168
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,567
It does what you tell it?

169
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,041
Yeah. Sort of.

170
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,201
The sun?

171
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,121
No, no, no. Fire.

172
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,647
Hi, fire.

173
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,488
It's not alive.

174
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,529
But you said it was dying.

175
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,601
Sorry.

176
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,009
It comes from where you come from?

177
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,248
No. No, I make it.

178
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,051
Make some for me.
Okay.

179
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,087
Make!

180
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,241
It doesn't come out of me.

181
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,209
Make! Make it!

182
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,206
You do this a lot.

183
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,883
Are you dead?

184
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,122
Can I have your fire if you're dead?

185
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,526
Clear!

186
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,530
Hey, those are cold!

187
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,206
You think? Listening shells, activate.

188
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,201
Iconcun

189
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,602
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.

190
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,043
I don't even know you.

191
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,681
I'm Guy.

192
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,841
Guy?

193
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,606
And this is Belt.
Cook, conversationalist, navigator.

194
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,930
Also, keeps my pants up.

195
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,005
What are pants up?

196
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,491
Who are you?

197
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,121
Eep.

198
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,362
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.

199
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,521
What?

200
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,841
I'm calling it The End.

201
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,360
How do you know?

202
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,965
I have seen it. It's coming this way.

203
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,602
First, the ground is going to shake.
Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.

204
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,921
Fire. Lava.

205
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,320
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but--

206
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,681
Believe me, everything we are
standing on will be gone.

207
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,968
We got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain, that way.

208
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,804
It's our only chance.

209
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,726
Come with me.

210
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,281
I can't.

211
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,767
Okay.

212
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,961
Here.

213
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,004
If you survive, call me.

214
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,725
Thank you.

215
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,851
Hello?

216
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,640
Hey!

217
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,801
Dad!

218
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,530
Are you hurt? What took you?

219
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,047
Nothing. I left on my own.

220
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,488
You what?

221
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,768
Dad, let me explain.

222
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,724
You never let me talk.

223
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,723
You're grounded.

224
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,441
Hey!

225
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,487
Eep!

226
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,801
Mom.

227
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,401
Grug! What happened?

228
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,848
You know what, I am so mad right now
that I can't talk to her.

229
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,167
Eep?

230
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,324
You will never believe it.
I found something new.

231
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,401
New!

232
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,681
New is a big problem!

233
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,841
Wait, wait!

234
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,729
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.

235
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,803
It wasn't bad.
-New is always bad.

236
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,371
No. He was nice.

237
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,488
What? Excuse me? He?

238
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,645
I thought he was a warthog,
but then he turned into a boy.

239
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,801
Strange.

240
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,849
Usually it's the reverse.

241
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,361
Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy--

242
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,006
There was a boy.

243
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,049
Watch. I'm going to call him.

244
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,087
What is wrong with you?

245
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,241
It was dangerous.

246
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,283
It was beautiful!

247
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,562
You want to see dangerous? Here!

248
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,121
My sniffer!

249
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,367
Okay, that's it!

250
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,851
We're going back to the cave...

251
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,526
and you're going to stay in there
until you're older than...

252
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,081
her!

253
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,241
What!

254
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,725
You can't keep me inside forever!

255
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,804
He said this would happen.

256
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,410
Get to the cave!

257
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,281
Go!

258
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,371
Look out!

259
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,681
Stop!

260
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,485
Is everyone okay?

261
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,886
Yes.

262
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,563
Grug, the cave...

263
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,370
it's gone.

264
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,840
No.

265
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,962
You really need to see this.

266
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,481
We should go there!

267
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,723
No. No one is going anywhere.

268
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,682
What else did that boy say?

269
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,521
Grug?

270
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,685
Just go! Just go!

271
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,887
Go!

272
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,370
One, two, three, four, five--

273
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,046
Six.

274
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,803
Where are we?

275
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,122
I don't know. I'm not sure.

276
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,049
Down.

277
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,481
In a lower place.

278
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,928
But one thing is for sure,
we can't go back the way we came.

279
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,601
Sandy? What is it?

280
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,401
No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!

281
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,046
We can't be out in the open like this.

282
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,929
We need a cave.

283
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,845
Now, step where I step.

284
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,170
Okay. Stay quiet.

285
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,800
Hopefully, nothing big
knows we're here yet.

286
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,766
Wait.

287
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,286
Okay.

288
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,487
Wait.

289
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,605
Okay.

290
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,841
Wait!

291
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,081
Wait.

292
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,961
Okay.

293
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,201
Wait.

294
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,361
Wait.

295
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,607
So, Dad...

296
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,521
just to be clear, are we looking for
the exact same cave?

297
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,160
If it was me--
I'm just throwing this out there...

298
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,721
if it was me choosing the cave...

299
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,046
I would go with a smaller cave.

300
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,561
Wait.

301
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,441
Dad?

302
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,450
I'll take care of this.

303
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,690
All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!

304
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,605
Now you got them right--

305
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,886
Man, they're really--

306
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,405
I'm loving this.

307
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,361
Dad, I got it.

308
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,045
Just stop running into their fists.

309
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,171
Grug, when you're done,
we should get going.

310
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,530
That's right. You can't get past this!

311
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,650
Climb! Climb! Climb!

312
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,687
Cave!

313
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,966
Go! Go!

314
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,727
Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.

315
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,010
Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!

316
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,890
Okay.

317
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,125
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.

318
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,009
And seven...

319
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,482
if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.

320
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,042
It's scared of the dark.

321
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,651
Wait, we're scared of the dark.

322
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,891
Kill circle!

323
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,081
Eep!

324
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,961
Eep!

325
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,490
Cavies!
-Cavies?

326
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,166
Cavemen! Stand back!
They're practically animals.

327
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,926
You see their bony, sloping foreheads?
-Yeah.

328
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,606
The huge primitive teeth?

329
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,041
Yeah.

330
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,770
The excessive body hair.

331
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,366
That one has got a tail.

332
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,481
Yeah.

333
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,245
All right. Close your eyes.
I'm going to have to take their lives.

334
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,284
No! It won't help.
They're my family.

335
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,441
What?

336
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,371
The sun is in his hands!

337
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,921
No, no. It's fire.

338
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,406
Where did it come from?

339
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,925
He made it.

340
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,121
Make some for me!

341
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,566
It doesn't come out of him.

342
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,210
Make. Make it!

343
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,126
You're a lot like your daughter.

344
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,805
Great, now he's broken.

345
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,689
It's a baby sun.

346
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,806
Hey, stay back.
We don't know what it wants.

347
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,804
Now, we'll all sit here
and wait for the sun to come back.

348
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,361
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave...

349
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,211
and pretend today never happened.

350
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,646
Isn't this fun, Eep?

351
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,086
Eep, don't touch him.

352
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,571
Goodness knows where he's been.

353
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,643
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.

354
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,641
Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.

355
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,810
What a cute little guy.

356
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,769
Hey. Stay back.

357
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,763
No, no, no, wait!

358
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,966
It likes me.

359
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,485
Hey! It's biting me!

360
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,047
Thunk! Try hiding from it
in the tall, dry grass!

361
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,688
No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.

362
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,841
They're biting me!

363
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,851
More fire babies.

364
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,121
Hi.

365
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,328
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.

366
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,284
Yeah. But I won't let him.

367
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,005
Hold on, son. Come back!

368
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,005
No, stop! Let me go!

369
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,368
Get out! Out! Out!

370
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,409
Eat up, babies!

371
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,083
No, stop touching me!

372
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,201
Die!

373
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,244
Iwin!

374
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,491
They're not so scary
once you get to know them.

375
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,202
Who are you people?

376
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,771
I'm sorry.

377
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,161
We're the Croods!

378
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,680
And you are?

379
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,441
Guy.

380
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,885
Hi, Guy.

381
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,487
Wow!

382
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,684
It looks like magic.

383
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,081
And smells like food.

384
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,884
No, don't eat it, it's new.

385
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,291
Still alive!

386
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,363
Come on, keep eating.

387
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,644
Hey, where is Guy?

388
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,281
No!

389
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,441
Going somewhere?

390
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,126
The mountain? High ground?
End of the world, remember?

391
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,284
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.

392
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,807
No. That was just the beginning of the end.

393
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,446
The end of the end is still coming.

394
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,728
Eep. Drop it.

395
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,444
We can't let him go!

396
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,809
What if we don't find a
cave before sunset?

397
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,689
What if it takes a few days?

398
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,767
What if the birds come back?

399
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,324
We need his fire, dummy!

400
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,483
Fine. You're staying with us
until we find a cave.

401
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,689
What? No, I'm not.
Don't make me a part of this!

402
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,724
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

403
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,006
I've got a dream...

404
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,248
a mission, a reason to live!

405
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,526
Not anymore.

406
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,364
I've got an idea.

407
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,488
Let's go to that mountain.

408
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,641
It's too far.

409
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,644
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

410
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,241
There are caves on that mountain.

411
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,640
Have you been there?

412
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,887
It's a mountain.

413
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,361
Mountains are safe.
Mountains have caves.

414
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,522
And water. And sticks.

415
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,246
Mom? Did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!

416
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,846
Yes. Sticks and caves.
Caves and sticks.

417
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,161
Crazy sticks. Let's go.

418
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,161
Quiet!

419
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,131
That thing is weird.

420
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,089
No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.

421
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,605
That's just Belt.

422
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,931
I've made a decision.

423
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,560
We're going to that mountain.

424
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,242
Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.

425
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,084
Just feels right.

426
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,369
I don't know, Grug.
We've never really walked that far.

427
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,568
I don't think my feet can do that.

428
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,371
I'll never live long enough to get there.

429
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,725
Let's do it.

430
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,608
Come on, just think.

431
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,765
Our whole family packed together
on a long, slow, trip across country?

432
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,843
Days and nights with just each other.

433
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,729
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.

434
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,289
We'll become closer as a family.

435
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,441
Get her off!

436
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,682
If you're not ready to challenge her,
then don't look her in the eye.

437
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,889
Could you keep your big giant arms
on your side of the trail?

438
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,682
Isn't this fun?
We're taking our first trip together.

439
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,084
Stop shoving,
or I will pull out your tongue!

440
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,402
Do you want me to
turn this family around? Do you?

441
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,245
Because I will
turn this family around so fast!

442
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,050
Dad, I gotta 90!

443
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,282
Come on, you can hold it.
-I don't think so.

444
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,641
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

445
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,926
I'm touching--
-Gran.

446
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,560
Dad, I still gotta go!

447
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,564
Fine. Just go behind one of those
lumpy things and make it fast.

448
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,883
Something bit me!
-I don't blame it.

449
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,520
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?

450
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,601
No.

451
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,205
How about now?
-No.

452
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,606
Now?
-No.

453
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,681
Now?

454
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,001
I can do this all day long.

455
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,448
No, no, no and still no.

456
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,762
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

457
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,281
Grug, we're all pretty tired!

458
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,805
We'll eat when we get there.

459
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,405
It's taking too long!

460
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,289
I'm grabbing a snack.

461
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,884
Don't do that. He will cut you.

462
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,963
That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.

463
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,201
What's a pet?

464
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,124
An animal you don't eat.

465
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,282
We call those children.

466
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,127
No man should have a pet.
It's weird and wrong.

467
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,803
-It's food!
-No, please!

468
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,724
Not that. That!

469
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,810
Food fixes everything.

470
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,485
Show me your hunting face.

471
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,485
Not you. You're still grounded.

472
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,971
Come on, Thunk.

473
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,770
My feet hurt.

474
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,844
You look tense.
-I'm not tense.

475
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,483
Angry girl wants to be doing
what they're doing.

476
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,486
I wasn't ready.

477
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,524
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!

478
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,529
Why are you doing this?

479
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,006
What are they doing?

480
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,366
Hunfing.

481
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,522
Get it off! You stay away from me.

482
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,841
No, seriously, what are they doing?

483
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,004
You've got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg.

484
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,042
Now you're just rubbing it in.

485
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,489
There, who's hungry for scorpion?

486
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,120
What happened to the egg and the bird?

487
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,881
We lost him.

488
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,691
But when the bird stepped on me
and pushed me into the ground...

489
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,922
the scorpion grabbed a hold of me...

490
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,401
and one thing led to another
and here we are eating him.

491
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,607
So, win-win.

492
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,411
Not enough. Not enough!
I need more.

493
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,370
I need more.

494
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,411
Look at that.
She's not going to eat me, right?

495
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,561
You're too skinny.

496
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,768
If she was going to eat anyone
it would be--

497
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,567
Mom!

498
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,244
She's locked her jaw!

499
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,209
Get a stick! Get a stick!

500
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,246
Stay away!

501
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,210
You sick old monster!

502
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,169
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

503
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,324
Hold her still. Use a rock.

504
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,367
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?

505
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,766
Why are you rolling away?

506
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,922
I just want something to eat.

507
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,243
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!

508
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,441
Please.

509
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,845
I'll let you help me hunt.

510
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,081
Really?

511
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,360
Don't wait on me. They're all over me.

512
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,045
Tell my story.

513
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,205
Okay.

514
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,361
What do you call this?

515
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,726
A trap.

516
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,046
What does it do?

517
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,201
Well--

518
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,128
How long have you been alone?

519
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,566
So, what do we do?

520
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,450
How's your acting?

521
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,326
You're good at this.

522
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,130
No. Sorry.

523
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,441
Okay.

524
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,324
Yeah, that's yours.
-Excuse me.

525
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,011
Your other hand--

526
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,561
That's my arm.
-Okay, I'm moving it.

527
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,725
Going under.

528
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,648
It didn't step in your trap-y thing.

529
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,246
Yeah, I noticed!

530
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,646
Where's Eep?

531
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,810
She's awesome.

532
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,201
Eep!

533
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,967
Dad,no!

534
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,608
It's an avalanche of flavor.

535
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,522
Looks like we won't be
having any leftovers.

536
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,603
What are left overs?

537
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,922
When you have so much food to eat,
you have some left over.

538
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,602
We never have that much food.

539
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,208
Grug, how about a story?

540
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,727
That's a good idea. How about a story?

541
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,163
Yeah, tell us a story!

542
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,367
Once upon a time,
there was a little tiger...

543
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,091
who lived in a cave with her family.

544
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,446
There were a lot of rules...

545
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,567
but the big, simple one
was to never leave the cave at night.

546
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,521
And the door was so heavy,
you'd think it would be easy to remember.

547
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,966
So easy to remember!

548
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,360
I know.

549
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,447
But, while everyone was asleep...

550
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,965
she went out anyway.

551
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,605
No!
'Yes!

552
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,525
And no sooner than she did,
their cave was destroyed...

553
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,286
and everyone had to go
on this long, sucky walk...

554
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,204
with some weirdo they met...

555
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,805
and die!

556
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,046
The end.

557
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,728
I did not see that coming. Twist ending.

558
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,484
My stories never end like that.

559
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,489
Yes! Two stories in one night!

560
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,247
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.

561
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,210
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful tiger.

562
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,284
She lived in a cave
with the rest of her family.

563
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,206
Her father and mother told her,
You may go anywhere you want...

564
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,921
but never go near the cliff,
for you could fall.

565
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,651
And die. Good story.

566
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,282
But when no one was looking...

567
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,801
she'd go near the cliff...

568
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,883
for the closer she came to the edge...

569
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,487
the more she could hear,
the more she could see...

570
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,563
the more she could feel.

571
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,966
Finally...

572
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,329
she stood at the very edge.

573
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,244
She saw a light.

574
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,483
She leaned out to touch it...

575
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,201
and she slipped.

576
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,885
And she fell.

577
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,969
And she flew.

578
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,691
Where did she fly?

579
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,281
Tomorrow.

580
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,566
Tomorrow?

581
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,610
A place with more suns in the sky
than you can count.

582
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,165
It would be so bright.

583
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,085
A place not like today, or yesterday.

584
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,050
A place where things are better.

585
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,689
Tomorrow isn't a place.

586
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,051
You can't see it!

587
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,089
Yes, it is.

588
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,171
I've seen it.

589
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,889
That's where I'm going.

590
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,245
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

591
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,841
And when we wake up...

592
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,247
we're going to find the place
that has everything we want.

593
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,447
Tomorrow?

594
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,851
A cave.

595
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,729
That was too close. it almost caught us.

596
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,684
I was watching. We were fine.

597
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,006
We gotta move faster.

598
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,209
Do you people have any other speed
aside from wander?

599
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,408
I'll take a shamble at this point.

600
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,409
Hey, do you have a minute?

601
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,409
How did the tiger fly?

602
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,001
I only share when I'm outside the log.

603
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,525
I'm funny that way.

604
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,684
Leave this to me.

605
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,886
Hey, Thunk...

606
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,008
you have a spider on your face.

607
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,361
Oops.

608
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,125
He's loose!

609
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,447
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.

610
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,886
Do you mean these rocks?

611
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,883
Do not step on these rocks!

612
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,769
Step aside, girls.

613
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,050
Hello? Nobody's listening!
No one is listening.

614
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,044
You cannot walk on those!

615
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,081
Get back here now!

616
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,405
There goes our chance for survival.

617
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,403
And our log!

618
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,401
Okay.

619
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,604
Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly...

620
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,091
but it doesn't get better.

621
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,411
How about--

622
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,086
Don't walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all.

623
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,130
Come on.

624
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,451
I can help you...

625
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,126
but we're going to have to
make a few changes around here.

626
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,282
The log ride is over.

627
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,771
Drop the log.

628
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,128
Now, kick it away.

629
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,770
Farther.

630
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,641
Really?

631
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,529
Okay, smart Guy...

632
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,966
now what?

633
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,688
Good fish, good fish.

634
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,851
Okay. Now you can look.

635
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,646
I love them!
Where are my feet?

636
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,006
They're still there!

637
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,121
Okay.

638
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,720
You're really heavy.

639
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,006
Really?

640
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,321
Thank you!

641
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,010
Hey. Wait!

642
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,646
Okay.

643
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,529
She's up. We're good. I'm good.

644
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,321
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?

645
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,402
I'm calling it a brain.

646
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,881
I'm pretty sure it's
where ideas come from.

647
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,089
Dad, I don't have a brain.

648
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,523
We've gotten along just fine
without brains until now.

649
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,883
Cavemen don't need brains.
We have these.

650
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,327
That's what I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings.

651
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,727
Now, let's get to that mountain!

652
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,042
Wow! I love those!

653
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,407
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.

654
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,050
So, how did the tiger fly?

655
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,043
She jumped on the sun...

656
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,929
and rode it to Tomorrow.

657
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,882
No,no,no.

658
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,521
Hi, Dad!

659
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,490
Bye. Dad!

660
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,846
You've seen rain before, right?

661
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,287
We don't get out much.

662
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,845
Eep, looks dangerous.

663
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,041
Dad, you say that about everything.

664
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,201
Careful.

665
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,686
Really? Okay.

666
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,724
No, no, no. Not cool!

667
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,086
So, the bear says, Your cave? I've been
dumping my bones here since last week.

668
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,406
Last week!

669
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,885
That's a funny story!

670
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,122
It's not a story. It's a joke.

671
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,566
What's a joke?

672
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,764
Just making something up
to make you laugh.

673
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,121
One for you.
-Thanks.

674
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,250
One for you. And this one's for you.

675
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,961
Okay.

676
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,963
Okay! That's enough!

677
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,442
I don't see why the kids
need their own shells.

678
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,648
So if anyone gets in trouble,
we can call the others.

679
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,610
Wait, you're saying we should split up?

680
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,764
We can try more paths at once.
It's the fastest way through.

681
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,446
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.

682
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,601
They can handle it.

683
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,000
We can do it, Dad.

684
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,764
No,no,no.

685
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,962
It's my job to keep you safe.

686
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,442
I'm still in charge
and we are not splitting up.

687
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,246
Except for you two.

688
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,291
And that's final.

689
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,610
Hello?

690
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,728
Is everyone all right?

691
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,166
We're okay, Grug.

692
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,402
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.

693
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,131
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do? What do I do right now?

694
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,169
Stay where you are. I'll find you.

695
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,924
No. Too slow.

696
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,004
Everybody, keep moving forward
and we'll get out.

697
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,161
Dad?

698
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,685
Yeah.

699
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,205
Okay.

700
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,840
Remember, never not be afraid.

701
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,889
You can do this!

702
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,202
It's going to be okay,
it's going to be okay.

703
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,522
I'm going to pass out.

704
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,123
Sandy. Sandy!

705
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,444
Give me another one.

706
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,405
You dropped these.

707
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,565
Come with me.

708
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,164
Here, boy! Catch!

709
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,931
Yoo-hoo!

710
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,320
Gran?

711
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,881
Mom?

712
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,530
Wow.

713
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,451
Grug?

714
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,044
I'll go get him.

715
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,521
Good boy! Who's a good boy?

716
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,728
You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!

717
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,689
You need a name. You want a name?

718
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,524
I'm going to call you Douglas.

719
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,007
Can you do tricks? Roll over.

720
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,049
Come on, Douglas, roll over.

721
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,042
Good boy, Douglas!

722
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,370
I was in love once.

723
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,364
He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.

724
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,921
It was quite a scandal.

725
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,088
We fed each other berries, we danced.

726
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,562
Then my father smashed him with a rock
and traded me to your grandfather.

727
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,970
Croods!

728
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,406
Get down here.

729
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,370
Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.

730
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,127
Guy is with them. Okay.

731
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,721
Thank you.

732
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,771
Thank you for bringing me
that interesting Guy update.

733
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,884
Okay. I'm going to go up...

734
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,728
and why don't you join us
when you stop being a big drag!

735
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,490
Sleep pile?

736
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,484
How about a story?

737
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,451
Anyone?

738
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,085
And then Torg said,
Know it? I drew it.

739
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,643
That makes no sense.

740
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,483
I know it was hard for you
to bring us along...

741
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,530
but they had the
best day of their lives.

742
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,320
Thank you for that.

743
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,171
I want to show you something.

744
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,881
More suns in the sky than you can count.

745
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,730
Every sun that crosses our sky
comes to rest up there.

746
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,723
Tomorrow.

747
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,723
That's where we'll be safe.

748
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,403
I'm going with Guy.

749
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,246
No. Not my little girl.

750
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,364
Come with us.

751
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,245
I can't go without Grug.

752
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,085
That makes one of us. Count me in.

753
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,890
Really, Mom? Now?

754
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,287
Grug has no idea how to protect us.

755
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,568
In fact, he has no ideas at all!

756
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,724
No, that's not true.
What about that one time when he...

757
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,206
Face it.

758
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,409
If he actually had an idea of his own...

759
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,767
I'd have a heart attack and die!

760
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,241
Grug?

761
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,566
'Dad!
'Dad!

762
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,883
He's a big guy. How could he
just disappear like that?

763
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,806
Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady
if she's seen Dad.

764
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,131
Haven't seen him.

765
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,644
What are you doing?

766
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,801
Yeah.

767
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,601
I was up all night, because
all these ideas just kept coming to me.

768
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,410
Is that a snake?

769
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,608
Belt, new and improved.

770
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,086
It's even self-tightening!

771
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,969
What is that on your head?

772
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,088
It's called desperation.

773
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,641
I call it a rug. Rhymes with Grug.

774
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,804
And this one, I call it a ride.

775
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,121
Rhymes with G rug.

776
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,281
That doesn't rhyme--

777
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,807
It's going to get us
places faster than shoes.

778
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,489
Yeah! Try to keep up!

779
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,483
I wish I had a ride.

780
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,206
And painting is a thing of the past.

781
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,806
I call this a snapshot.

782
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,201
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

783
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,767
I call them shades.

784
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,883
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

785
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,849
Where do you get these great ideas?

786
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,286
Since I don't have a brain...

787
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,841
they're coming from my stomach,
down deep below...

788
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,162
and then up again into my mind.

789
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,002
Grug, we have to keep moving.

790
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,971
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.

791
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,124
Like this. I call it a mobile home.

792
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,009
Isn't that something?

793
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,646
And I'm calling this one a lifterator.

794
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,721
Mom?

795
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,961
I know. It's bad.

796
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,168
I almost feel sorry for him.

797
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,525
No, I don't.

798
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,362
What are you trying to do, Grug?

799
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,525
See, I thought if I could have ideas...

800
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,171
like Guy...

801
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,168
maybe Eep would listen to me.

802
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,041
And maybe she wouldn't
want to go with Guy.

803
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,565
Grug.

804
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,200
Is that what this is all about?

805
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,769
And I also thought
it would kill your mother.

806
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,400
So win-win.

807
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,005
We're here!

808
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,290
Wow.

809
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,567
Cave!

810
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,641
Everyone inside.

811
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,926
Hurry up. Let's go.

812
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,326
Let's go. Go!

813
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,726
No!

814
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,965
No more caves, Grug.

815
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,167
What?

816
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,926
We're going to jump on the sun
and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!

817
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,401
Wait. So you're all going to do this?

818
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,167
Thunk?

819
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,170
Sorry, Dad.

820
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,281
You have to stop worrying for all of us.

821
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,165
It's my job to worry!
It's my job to follow the rules!

822
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,163
The rules don't work out here!

823
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,521
They kept us alive!

824
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,765
That wasn't living!
That was just not dying.

825
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,285
There's a difference.

826
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,966
Ugga, everyone,
you have to listen to me.

827
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,209
We would be dead if we listened to you!

828
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,762
We have to follow Guy now.

829
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,201
Guy.

830
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,371
Guy? Run.

831
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,321
This is pointless!

832
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,284
We're running out of time.
Everything is collapsing.

833
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,528
You're being irrational
and counterproductive!

834
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,011
Big words anger me!

835
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,721
Keep talking.

836
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,120
Countermeasures!

837
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,884
You remember how you were
this morning? You changed.

838
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,804
Idea man. Modern man.

839
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,524
I am a caveman!

840
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,886
No, no, no, wait!

841
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,287
No!

842
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,364
What is this stuff that saves you
from my punches?

843
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,767
Tar.

844
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,207
No. I have to get back to them.

845
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,046
Stop struggling.

846
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,121
No!

847
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,241
Grug, stop!

848
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,567
No one gets out of this.

849
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,568
Believe me...

850
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,210
I know.

851
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,401
You r--

852
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,245
Family. Yeah.

853
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,964
Sorry.

854
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,766
I was little when it happened.

855
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,206
Last thing my parents told me was...

856
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,731
Don't hide.

857
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,090
Live.

858
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,287
Follow the sun.

859
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,568
You'll make it to Tomorrow.

860
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,922
You followed the light.

861
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,722
My daughter is a lot like you.

862
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,927
No.

863
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,605
She's like you.

864
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,809
She loves you,
but always forgets to say it.

865
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,486
Just like you forget to tell her.

866
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,691
I guess I was just busy
keeping them all alive.

867
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,607
It's okay. That's what dads do.

868
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,090
That's right.

869
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,487
But we can't do that from here.

870
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,325
We need one of your ideas.

871
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,004
Come on. You can do it.

872
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,324
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!

873
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,126
I've got it.

874
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,241
Wow.

875
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,290
Yeah, I know. But he's doing
the best with what he has.

876
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,641
Let's go.

877
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,684
There he is.

878
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,571
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.

879
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,721
Move me.

880
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,205
Okay, he sees us.

881
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,681
That's our cue. Now, work it!

882
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,240
He's not coming over.

883
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,050
I don't think our puppet
looks scared enough.

884
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,567
Scared? I'll show you scared.

885
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,324
Hand me those acting sticks!

886
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,404
Hold on!

887
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,122
Yes! You did it.

888
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,201
Dad!

889
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,607
Hey! We're okay!

890
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,445
Yeah.

891
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,930
We're okay.

892
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,451
Grug, your call.

893
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,568
Take us to Tomorrow.

894
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,966
Hurry!

895
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,327
Come on! We're going to make it!

896
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,530
You were right.

897
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,126
There it is! The sun!

898
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,483
We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!

899
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,641
Run!

900
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,041
I don't understand.

901
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,249
The sun was right here.
It was right here.

902
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,484
We have to go back to the cave.

903
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,045
Hurry, hurry, hurry-

904
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,363
Stay together. Let's keep moving.
Move, move, move.

905
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,005
Everybody, hold my hand.

906
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,766
Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go.
Let's stay together.

907
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,048
Grug. What's wrong with you?

908
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,283
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!

909
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,048
Grug, listen to me.

910
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,885
We've got to get back to that cave.

911
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,208
No more dark.

912
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,127
No more hiding.

913
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,608
No more caves.

914
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,282
What's the point of all this?

915
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,767
To follow the light.

916
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,124
I can't change.

917
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,442
I don't have ideas.

918
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,567
But I have my strength.

919
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,085
And right now...

920
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,561
that's all you need.

921
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,851
No, we don't know what's over there.
Maybe nothing!

922
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,968
It's too risky!

923
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,491
It's a chance.

924
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,282
I'll take that chance.

925
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,651
I've wanted to throw you away
ever since I met you.

926
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,649
That's a joke, right?

927
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,689
What's a joke?

928
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,610
He made it!

929
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,761
He made it.

930
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,961
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.

931
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,645
You're not coming, are you?

932
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,640
When you make it, so will I.

933
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,961
No!

934
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,210
You did good.

935
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,051
Dadda!

936
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,201
Gran--

937
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,522
No mush. Just throw me.

938
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,441
Wait.

939
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,206
You surprised me today...

940
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,805
lunkhead.

941
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,807
Still alive!

942
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,046
Time to go.

943
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,281
No.

944
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,528
I have too much to say to you.

945
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,126
I need to fix everything,
and I don't have time.

946
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,964
I can fix it.

947
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,245
This works good.

948
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,245
What do you call it?

949
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,402
I was thinking of calling it a hug.

950
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,443
Because it rhymes with Grug.

951
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,722
But you can change it if you want.

952
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,650
No. I like hug.

953
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,885
I love you.

954
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,601
L\\

955
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,645
Dad...

956
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,124
I'm scared.

957
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,766
Never be afraid.

958
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,526
There!

959
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,966
I see him!

960
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,761
Hey!

961
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,331
Hey, I did it!

962
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,963
Back! Stay back!

963
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,003
Stay back!

964
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,004
They're in trouble.

965
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,481
Hang on, I'm coming!

966
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,649
How do I get across?

967
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,969
I have to think. What would Guy do?

968
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,851
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?

969
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,963
What would I do?

970
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,290
Hold this.

971
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,127
Ihaveu.

972
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,968
Anidea!

973
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,681
Run!

974
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,205
Yes!

975
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,841
Douglas?

976
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,044
Hey, I know that guy.

977
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,924
Hold on!

978
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,444
It's not safe here.

979
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,130
I'll tell her.

980
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,089
I never got to tell him.

981
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,169
Eep, if your dad were here,
he would tell you to--

982
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,403
Get out of the way!

983
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,722
Wow. You sound just like him.

984
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,646
Get out of the way!

985
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,006
Dadda!

986
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,400
He did it!

987
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,011
He's riding the sun.

988
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,243
But, not very well.

989
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,568
Everybody out of the way!

990
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,165
Dad!

991
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,168
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?

992
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,883
I love you, too!

993
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,890
One, two, three, four...

994
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,565
five...

995
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,761
six...

996
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,922
and seven.

997
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,726
And a half.

998
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,525
And eight.

999
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,401
Nine.

1000
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,688
Douglas! Dad, you saved him!

1001
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,286
A boy has to have a pet.

1002
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,846
Turns out I'm a cat person.

1003
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,561
No.

1004
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,888
You really need to see this.

1005
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,444
We should go there.

1006
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,042
Yes! Coming through!

1007
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,561
Wait!

1008
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,890
This is me. My name is Eep.

1009
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,289
And this is my family, the Croods.

1010
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,807
If you weren't clued in
by the suntans and pets...

1011
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,651
we're not exactly cavemen anymore.

1012
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,685
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

1013
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,244
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...

1014
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,808
but now we know the Croods will make it.

1015
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,770
Because we changed the rules...

1016
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,763
the ones that kept us in the dark.

1017
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,685
And because of my dad,
who taught us that anyone can change.

1018
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,524
Release the baby!

1019
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,211
Sort of.

1020
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,288
So, from now on,
we'll stay out here...

1021
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,562
where we can follow the light.

1
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,280
My name is Flint Lockwood
My whole life..

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,020
I always wanted to be
a great inventor.

3
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,710
Just like my hero.

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,660
The Scientifically Wonderful
World of Science.

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,510
With your host, Chester V.

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,910
Welcome back, science friends.

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,084
You know, I have devoted my life
to inventing the future.

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,527
But every dream has a beginning.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,326
I still remember my first invention:

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,483
The humble Food Bar.

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,604
It was like Chester V
was speaking directly to me

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,490
using the language of science

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,846
Now look at us.

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,402
Our new Food Bar XL
with flavor crystals.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,803
Still making people happy
after all these years

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
Now, kids, you'll almost certainly
never be me.

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,848
But, remember, there's no such thing
as small science

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,888
Only small scientists!
We love you, Chester V!

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,722
Speaking of small scientists,
say goodbye, Barb

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,967
Goodbye, Barb

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,571
Can your ideas change the world?

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,241
Yes.

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,240
Just like Chester V

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
my dream was to make the
world a better place

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,249
Spray On Shoes!

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,929
How you gonna

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,241
get them off, nerd?

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,800
Unfortunately, a lot of
people didn't believe in me

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,650
But I never gave up

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,563
And eventually

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,847
I invented this:

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,208
A machine that could
turn water into food

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,249
Cheeseburger

34
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,721
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super Mutating

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,922
Dynamic Food Replicator

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,770
Or, for short

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,605
The FLDSMDFR

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,724
Because of my invention's
food weather

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,202
I finally made the
world a better place

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,362
Yeah!

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,567
I love it!

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,205
Or so I thought

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,240
When the weather evolved into
a disaster of epic portions

44
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,041
and the machine started
creating dangerous living food

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,726
I had to face the truth:

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,164
It was time to put an
end to my FLDSMDFR

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,447
Che Che Che Che

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,763
Cheese

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,481
By destroying
my greatest invention

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,927
I made something even better:

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,681
Friends!

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,604
You made me very proud, son

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,963
Thank you, Dad Sorry

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,964
Sam Sparks, in the eight minutes
since we saved the world

55
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,565
I've had time to reflect

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,121
And I think you and I
should have a place together

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,287
A Place?

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,210
A place where we work

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,450
You think we work together?

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,488
I do

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,326
Awesome! Yes!

62
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,128
We could build a lab
With cool weather

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,282
forecasting devices!

64
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,091
We can invent fantastic machines
like the FLDSMDFR

65
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,889
Yeah!

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,400
But not that one No

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,530
Not ever Never, ever, ever!

68
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,524
What shall we call our lab?

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,330
How about Sparks-wood?

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,364
Sparks-wood

71
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,483
Sparks-wood is gonna need
some security

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,603
And I can be your mascot!

73
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,001
And I can be your dad

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,322
There are many ways
in which I can help

75
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,769
Can't forget you, lab partner

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,762
Steve!

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,923
Where'd he get the brown crayon?

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,602
This could be our
future Oh, yeah!

79
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,926
Greetings, friends

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,207
And namaste

81
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,962
Is that? Chester V?

82
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,281
Mustache

83
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,608
Please have some humanitarian aid

84
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,161
as a gesture of our goodwill

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,170
Chester V!

86
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,841
Your lab vest looks even cooler
in person!

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,085
Thank you The lack of sleeves
frees up my arms to do this

88
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,006
Hand, what did you do?

89
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,329
There's nothing wrong with your hand,
young Lockwood

90
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,565
You see, I am merely a hologram
of the real Chester V

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,209
The United Nations has asked
me and my Thinkquanauts

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,568
to assist in the cleanup
and containment

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,127
of the leftovers all over the world

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,206
Including your Swallow Falls

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,761
We'll get started on
the cleanup right away

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,968
As soon as you all leave

97
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,970
What? You need us to leave?

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,281
Listen up, ghost man

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,121
you expect us to skedaddle from our
homes because of some nasty leftovers?

100
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,966
Yes Yes, I do

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,845
Son, you can't argue
with yellow police tape

102
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,526
Everybody back up!
Listen to ghost man

103
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,125
But do not fret

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,762
All of you will be
temporarily relocated

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,328
to sunny San Franjose

106
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,409
California!

107
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,840
The home of Live Corp!
The home of Live Corp!

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,684
On my word as a hologram

109
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,442
you shall all return home
before you know it

110
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,843
Except for you, Flint Lockwood

111
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,241
Me? Why?

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,001
You are going

113
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,201
Wait, wait, wait No, no, no
Where am I going?

114
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,881
Oh, please tell me!

115
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,487
Just give it a second He's buffering

116
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,570
You are going to join me
at Live Corp

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,565
and help us make the world
a better place

118
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,009
Sir, that's all I've ever wanted

119
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,401
But I can't

120
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,171
On account of making a promise
two minutes ago

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
to build a lab with my friends, sir

122
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,527
I understand, Lockwood

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,604
But if you become
a Thinkquanaut like me

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,167
then all your dreams will come true

125
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,850
You have to do this!

126
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,044
What about our dream?

127
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,170
Flint, this is a once in a life-time
opportunity

128
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,807
We're all behind you

129
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,285
Are you guys sure?

130
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,881
Sure

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,681
This is the best day ever!

132
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,568
Sir, I've taken care of everything
The locals have been evacuated

133
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,246
Splendid And the inventor?

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,323
Oh, he took the job
Outstanding!

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,085
Now we can keep an eye on him

136
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,642
He has no idea of our real plan

137
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,925
Contact me as soon as Operation
Capture the Invention succeeds

138
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,770
Live Corp

139
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,324
Cheeseburger

140
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,801
Oh, big day, big day!
Big day, big day

141
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,610
big day! Yes!

142
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,962
Wake up, Steve!

143
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,962
Steve

144
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,969
Do I look like a future Thinkquanaut?

145
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,760
Morning there, skipper
You want a sardine scramble?

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
No, thanks! Can't be late!

147
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,007
Flint! Ask that Chester V when
he thinks we can go home again

148
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,087
Morning, Sam!

149
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,926
Morning, Flint! Are you ready
for your first day?

150
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,527
Yeah! Are you?

151
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,329
Sam?

152
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,124
Well, this is me Good luck
with your new jobs, guys

153
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,209
Good luck, Flint!
Break a leg, Flint!

154
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,965
Bye!

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,110
Good morning, Flint Lockwood
and lab partner

156
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,447
I'm Barb

157
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,326
I know, I'm a huge fan

158
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,163
Monkey

159
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,340
Excuse me

160
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,366
I'm an ape One of Chester V's
most brilliant innovations

161
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,921
An orangutan with a human brain

162
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,601
within my ape brain

163
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,046
Like a turducken

164
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,886
I'll be your welcome ambassador
Soy latte?

165
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,406
Okay

166
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,083
Coffee and milk?

167
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,846
Are you ready to

I'm so looking forward
to working with you guy

Anxious!

193
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,166
That's not even a possibility
until our next vesting ceremony

194
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,670
What's that?
That's where Chester V

195
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,481
handpicks a great inventor
and makes him into a Thinkquanaut

196
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,682
When? When?

197
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,651
Next one's in six months,
so submit your ideas

198
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,882
and who knows?
He might choose you

199
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,042
Really?

200
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,601

double whipped whipped cream?

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,409
We're gonna have to get used to
that landing

203
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,760
Okay, Steve, we have six months
until the vesting ceremony

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,286
Let's do this thing

205
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,487
Can

206
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,460
That's the spirit, Steve!

207
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,208
Say goodbye

208
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,290
to ice cubes
with the Re Freeze a Fan!

209
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,811

The Grocery Deliverator!

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,367
Can your ideas change the world?

215
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,364
Invisible coffee table!

216
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,567
Flint

217
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,883
Can your ideas

218
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,921
change the world?

219
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,609
Flint!

220
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,444
The Celebrationator!

221
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,087
A party in a box for any occasion

222
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,809
Okay, Steve, time to celebrate!

223
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,007
Celebrate!

224
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,966
Flint!

225
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,044
Happy birthday, Tim Lockwood!

226
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,403
Here you go, Dad Hope you like it
Steve picked it out

227
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,801
Steve!

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,082
Yeah Yeah!

229
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,609
Okay, like we practiced
When I'm up on stage getting my vest

230
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,531
you hit the red button
when I say "celebrate"

231
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,369
Celebrate!

232
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,086
Careful, Steve!

233
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,005
This is a loaded party in ab ox
Hello, Team Live Corp!

234
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
It's a pleasure to welcome you

235
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,445
to our annual Thinkquanaut
vesting ceremony!

236
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,121
Chester V!

237
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,005
I have built the coolest, hippest
company in the world

238
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,167
As you all know, the Food Bar
is the lifeblood of this company

239
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,121
And this year, I've challenged myself
to reinvent taste

240
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,688
So in two short weeks

241
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,281
we shall release the new
Live Corp Food Bar!

242
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,249
Version 8.0!

243
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,882
Yes!
And now, without

244
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,169
further ado, who will be this year's

245
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,688
newest Live Corp Thinkquanaut?

246
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,041
Yeah!

247
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,563
We have received thousands
of invention submissions

248
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,963
and today, one of them
will be deemed

249
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,810
Thinkquanaut worthy

250
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,007
Thank you, Barb

251
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,602
This person comes from an island

252
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,850
He's got a memorable mop
of unruly hair

253
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,087
Hair Hair!

254
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,562
That's me!

255
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,485
Our newest Live Corp
Thinkquanaut is:

256
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,803
Flint

257
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,590
Yeah!

258
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,484
Ly McCallahan!
No

259
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,728
Crikey blikey! Yes!

260
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,731
For inventing a zero emission
car that runs on cute

261
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,110
This is the greatest day of my life!

262
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,802
Didgeridoo! I'm finally a real inventor!

263
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,330
Sorry, Steve No reason to celebrate

264
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,881
Celebrate!
Wait, Steve, no, no, no No!

265
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,770
Hi, Sam, it's Flint

266
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,051
I see you're live on TV
with a tornado

267
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,120
Probably why you're not
answering the phone

268
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,005
Thinkquanaut? I think not

269
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,924
Please call me back

270
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,161
Okay Bye!

271
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,440
Bad news! Sir, we lost contact

272
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,170
with Search Teams X and Y

273
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,407
What?
Yeah!

274
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,527
The situation is

275
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,460
grim, sir Still no sign
of the FLDSMDFR

276
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,051
Should I send in Team Z?

277
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,449
Are you mad, Barb?
We'll be all out of alphabet

278
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,287
Look, we're running low
on Thinkquanauts We need

279
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,370
someone expendable

280
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,444
Someone who knows the island
inside and out

281
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,321
Someone who's smart, but still naive

282
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,122
Someone who idolizes me has
recently hit rock bottom

283
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,523
and will now do
just about anything I ask

284
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,287
Where are we gonna find
someone so desperate?

285
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,525
I think we already have

286
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,347
Sprinkles!

287
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:01,188
Fire!

288
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,721
Flint, who's number one?

289
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,448
Ta da!

290
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,682
Hey, Flint, I got your message

291
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,201
Oh, no, what happened to you?

292
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,482
Flint, everyone gets humiliated
on national television

293
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,006
It's not that big a deal

294
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,641
Yeah, but not everyone
gets humiliated

295
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,451
in front of their childhood hero

296
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,365
I'll never be a real
inventor in Chester's eyes

297
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,163
Mom gave me this lab coat because

298
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,600
she always dreamed
I'd do great things

299
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,609
Now I guess I won't Now
that's a big bucket of churn

300
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,406
Flint, you don't need
Chester's approval

301
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,730
You can still make the world a
better place without an orange vest

302
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,564
I don't get vests

303
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,287
Is it winter on your torso
and summer on your arms?

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,890
For what it's worth, the people
who really care about you

305
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,930
think you look great in your lab coat

306
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,321
Good night, Mr Lockwood

307
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,045
Good night, my dear

308
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,607
Hey, look, son

309
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,366
This Chester V guy

310
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,922
He promised us we'd be home
before we know it Well

311
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,445
we darn sure know it
and we're not home

312
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,571
So I say you, me and your friends

313
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,371
we take the boat
We can go fishing every day

314
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,161
And if there's still a mess on the island,
we can go clean it up ourselves

315
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,529
Dad, please I'm not into fishing

316
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,691
And cleanup? You're way too old
to be doing that kind of work

317
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,968
I'm only 49

318
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,441
Flint Lockwood, please

319
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,885
Oh, Flint

320
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,100
There's Could you
come to the door, please?

321
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,363
I think it's that monkey
in your poster

322
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,011
What? No!

323
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,600
Barb?

324
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,241
Good day

325
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,922
I'm afraid I have something very
important to discuss with you

326
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,002
Live Corp

327
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,891
Chester V wants to see me?

328
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,561
Follow me

329
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,841
Young Lockwood

330
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,969
Chester V Sir

331
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,369
I can explain everything

332
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,682
I thought I was gonna meet
the real Chester V

333
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,887
You are..

334
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,844
Oh, not me Him

335
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,326
Yes, it's me

336
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,130
Sorry about that

337
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,770
My holograms and I were having
an urgent brainstorming session

338
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,805
Mr V! You're real!

339
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,010
I'm so excited to get this opportunity
to show you my inventions

340
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,608
Hold on Hold on That's not
why I brought you here tonight

341
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,081
Our cleanup operation
back on Swallow Falls

342
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,244
has met with
unexpected complications

343
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,521
This is a photograph

344
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,524
before we began our cleanup

345
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,364
And this was three days ago

346
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,891
It gets worse, Flint

347
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,322
There's only two of us left
We need help

348
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,682
What is that thing?

349
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,246
Cheesy

350
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,126
It appears to be
a living cheeseburger

351
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,569
with french fry legs
and sesame seed eyes

352
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,211
Living food?

353
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,125
Oh, no This could only mean
one thing

354
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,125
The FLDSMDFR
survived the explosion

355
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,528
and it's still operating

356
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,331
This is what worries me most

357
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,361
They're trying to learn to swim

358
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,571
If they succeed and

359
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,200
get to the mainland

360
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,600
they will destroy monuments
all around the world

361
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,920
including the one monument

362
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,287
your food storm didn't destroy

363
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,002
Not Lady Liberty! I've gotta destroy
the FLDSMDFR But how?

364
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,244
Well, my Thinkquanauts
have invented

365
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,083
this

366
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,286
The BS-USB

367
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,442
Or BS-USB

368
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,564
A Bifurcating Systematic
Universal Stop Button!

369
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,244
Precisely It would destroy the
machine and everything it created

370
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,611
But we cannot find your FLDSMDFR

371
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,522
We've searched
everywhere and failed

372
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,651
Chester, I'll find the machine
I invented it I can fix this!

373
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,211
Brilliant!

374
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,171
But are you sure you want to
take this on alone?

375
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,970
Yes! Wait, did you say "alone"?

376
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,571
Alone it is, then

377
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,805
If you succeed, you'll be more
than just a Thinkquanaut

378
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,486
You'll be my hero

379
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,881
Your hero?

380
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,168
Yes, my hero

381
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,368
Your mission must be kept a secret

382
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,887
We don't wanna create
a worldwide panic

383
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,647
You mustn't tell anyone, not even
your closest friends and family

384
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,411
Sir, I won't tell a soul

385
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,684
Sam! Sam, Sam, Sam!
I gotta tell you a secret! Sam!

386
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,810
Big news I'm going to Swallow Falls
to destroy the FLDSMDFR

387
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,804
which is creating
deadly food monsters

388
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,362
which are trying to learn to swim
so they can attack Lady Liberty!

389
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,367
Sam?

390
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,125
Wait, you're doing this alone?

391
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,110
Yeah Please don't tell Dad If he finds
out I'm going back to Swallow Falls

392
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,310
he's gonna wanna come too

393
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,085
Well, I'm coming

394
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,563
What? No! I promised Chester V
I would go alone

395
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,925
There's no talking you out of this?

396
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,082
Nope Wait

397
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,324
Sam, it's gonna be deadly dangerous
with a good chance of death

398
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,170
And that's why we'll need help

399
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,406
Triple decaf mochaccino boba latte

400
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,603
with skim soy and nutmeg sprinkle?

401
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,729
I'd like to order something strong

402
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,769
Wait your turn, fancy pants

403
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,728
Flint Lockwood

404
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,200
and Sam Sparks!

405
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,410
And Steve too!

406
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,809
Juicy!
Earl, we need your help

407
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,884
Swallow Falls is overrun
with deadly food monsters

408
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,729
Hey

409
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,089
where's my coffee?
Coffee? I'm not a barista

410
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,287
I'm a polista!

411
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,161
Let's ride!

412
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,721
Can I come too, Dad?

413
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,807
Son, you are my beautiful,
precious little angel

414
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,122
But I cannot let you come with me

415
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,567
Not until you get
your first chest hair

416
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,560
I have chest hair

417
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,441
It's just like mine

418
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,642
Wait a minute

419
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,484
That's not a chest hair

420
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,370
That's cupcake frosting

421
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,390
Tell your mom
I'm getting our home back

422
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,640
What's up?

423
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,246
Sponge

424
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,402
Forceps

425
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,721
A swab

426
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,321
Manny We need your help.
I can drop everything

427
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,482
Camera

428
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,251
Chick 'n' sushi
Get it while it's cold

429
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,562
Yo, Chicken Brent!

430
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,807
In the flesh

431
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,960
Swallow Falls is in trouble
Will you help us?

432
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,921
You bet I will I just need someone
to cover my shift

433
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,764
Thanks, tree

434
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,527
Okay, gang

435
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,401
We'll be traveling to the island
using my Grocery Deliverator!

436
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,565
All right, who wants to go first?

437
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,448
Hungry

438
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,510
Yes, Steve, hungry for adventure

439
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,408
See you on the island,
my brave lab partner

440
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,243
Afraid!

441
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,604
It worked!

442
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,889
Banana! Banana! Banana! Steve!

443
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,127
I guess it only works on food
I gotta fix that

444
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,450
Ahoy there, skipper, my boy

445
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,205
Dad Mr Lockwood?

446
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,608
Dad, no How did you know
we were here?

447
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,240
I could see you from the apartment

448
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,850
Flint, if you're going home, so am I

449
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,804
The island's gonna be
very dangerous

450
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,080
I was born on the island, and I wanna
die on that island, just like your mom.

451
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,140
Besides, I know that place like
the inside of a tackle box I wanna help

452
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,050
No!
Flint, let him help.

453
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,470
The man does have a boat

454
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,967
Which is twice as many boats
as we have

455
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,650
Fine But we'll get there faster

456
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,360
if we use the Grocery Deliverator

457
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,367
Steve!

458
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,525
Okay, okay, we'll take the boat!

459
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,487
Shoving off!

460
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,404
Ninety nine buckets of chum on a boat

461
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,527
Ninety nine buckets

462
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,647
Of chum

463
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,528
Nineteen buckets of chum on a boat 

464
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,649
Nineteen buckets of chum

465
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,450
 You hold your nose 

466
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,160
 And out one goes
There's 18 buckets of chum on a boat 

467
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,767
We'll be there in two flaps
of a sardine's fluke!

468
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,641
Thanks, Dad!

469
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,207
Okay, when we land at Swallow Falls

470
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,647
our first objective is to get to my lab

471
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,890
I can use my old computer to pinpoint
the FLDSMDFR's location

472
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,525
Once we find it, we can shut it down
with the utterly irreplaceable BS-USB

473
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,051
What if you don't find it?

474
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,204
I have to It's my machine

475
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,120
If the world gets destroyed
by these, it's my fault

476
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,121
I can't let that happen

477
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,367
Land ho!

478
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,329
Land ho!

479
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,968
If we work together,
this should be easy as

480
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,809
Pie

481
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,963
Oh, no! We're Toast!

482
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,565
French toast!

483
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,205
This is totally

484
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,123
Bananas!

485
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,806
I was gonna say "nuts,"
but now I'm afraid to

486
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,849
Home!
No! Steve, wait!

487
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,889
The jungle's no place for a monkey

488
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,283
Home, home, home!

489
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,091
Manny, are you getting this?

490
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,084
I certainly am Flint

491
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,390
Look! The climate
has shifted dramatically

492
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,086
to allow this much vegetation
to grow!

493
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,171
Sam! Rat-birds!

494
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,049
Okay, then All ashore
that's going ashore

495
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,926
Dad, this place is really dangerous

496
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,687
I'd feel better if you stayed here
on the boat where it's safe

497
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,645
Safe? I wanna help

498
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,323
I'd never forgive myself if you
got eaten by a cheespider

499
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,244
He's right, Tim Lockwood

500
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,926
Don't worry, we'll get your home back

501
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,721
Well, fine

502
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,965
Thanks, Dad We'll try to be back
before suppertime, okay?

503
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,046
Sure

504
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,210
Look what's happened to our town

505
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,487
Look

506
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,681
There's my angel son

507
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,245
Cal's old preschool

508
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,805
My old van

509
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,211
Look! An old thing
that I've never seen before!

510
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,249
That's where

511
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,000
the Thinkquanauts were
attacked by a cheespider

512
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,001
It's like a cheesy spider web,
made of

513
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,760
cheese Let's get out of here!

514
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,651
No, wait What if there's
a survivor in there?

515
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,245
Stand back, everybody

516
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,687
I'm gonna cut the cheese

517
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,206
That was the cheese

518
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,690
Hello? Anybody in here?

519
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,728
Sorry

520
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,040
That is the biggest strawberry
I've ever seen in my life

521
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,051
Is it heavy?
Yeah But other than that

522
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,285
it looks like a perfectly normal,
fresh, delicious strawberry

523
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,131
Nwoo?

524
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,802
Nwoo?

525
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,963
It's moving!

526
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,641
Oh, that was a close one

527
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,087
You got a little someone
stuck to your pants

528
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,081
Get it off! Get it off me! Sam! Sam!

529
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,044
Hey, wait, wait Stop!

530
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,483
Sam, don't touch it! Put it down!
Put it down!

531
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,210
Look at him

532
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,761
Seriously?

533
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,730
I think I'll name him Barry!

534
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,725
Okay, Sam, could you please
put "Barry" down?

535
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,804
Look, we have to get to the FLDSMDFR
so we can shut it down

536
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,964
with this utterly irreplaceable
BS-USB

537
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,089
Hey! That's not for you!

538
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,448
I need that Please?

539
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,125
That BS-USB is really important

540
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,367
Nwoo?

541
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,300
Nwoo Yes Nwoo?

542
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,450
Hi, Nwoo Hey, you wanna
hand it to me, buddy?

543
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,801
I beg you

544
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,451
Please?

545
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,326
Please?

546
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,243
Nwoo

547
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,528
Nwoo, Nwoo Yes Yes There you go

548
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,926
No!

549
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,929
Don't let him get away!

550
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,086
Stop!

551
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,685
Stop!

552
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,887
Gotcha

553
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,250
Nwoo?
Here, you take it, you take it

554
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,047
You're gonna have to carry him
until he passes the BS-USB

555
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,601
And by pass, you mean

556
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,540
Yes Look, we better get a move on

557
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,121
before we run into any more
of these creatures

558
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,047
It's so beautiful

559
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,647
It's enough to make a grown man cry

560
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,150
But not this man

561
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,249
Get back in there, tear

562
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,960
Wow, I can't believe
the FLDSMDFR created

563
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,210
all of this

564
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,565
Where's Barry?

565
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,030
Just a little bit closer
I can get him

566
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,486
Come on, Earl, faster

567
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,646
Look at the mangoes
You mean flamingos

568
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,887
Flamangos!

569
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,531
There's a bunch of shrimp!

570
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,290
They look like chimpanzees

571
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,090
Shrimpanzees!
Shrimpanzees!

572
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,209
Those are some
tasty looking jellyfish!

573
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,091
What's that one over there?

574
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,606
That's just a tomato

575
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,681
Barry!

576
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,160
Come on!

577
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,851
Chester gave me that BS-USB

578
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,525
It's really important

579
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,851
Shrimpanzee Steve

580
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,047
Shrimpanzee Steve

581
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,049
Shrimpanzee Shove

582
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,430
Steve

583
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,920
There's a leek in the boat!

584
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,160
Hold on, everyone

585
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,970
This ain't gonna be no picnic

586
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,765
Stop! Get back here!

587
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,720
Keep it steady, Earl

588
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,365
Watermelophants!

589
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,643
Barry, grab my hand!

590
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,120
Barry!

591
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,921
Freeze, berry man

592
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,201
Thanks, Earl

593
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,608
Okay, come here

594
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,810
You have caused enough trouble
for one day

595
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,167
Susheep!

596
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,287
Cantalopes

597
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,045
I can't believe your machine

598
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,440
reprogrammed itself to create

599
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,848
this entire ecosystem of living food

600
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,401
How is that even possible?

601
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,165
I have no idea

602
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,970
Best we don't think about it

603
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,884
The world should know about this

604
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,964
Manny, is your camera still working?

605
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,996
Of course I've been
rolling since we

606
00:34:46,022 --> 00:34:48,233
landed So much for
keeping this a secret

607
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,242
We can't let these friends
tell the world anything

608
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,602
What we need to do is go there.

609
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,247
And separate Flint from his friends
so we can manage the situation

610
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,686
Champion!
Brilliant idea

611
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,604
Way to go, Chester Thank you

612
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,810
Barb, you take care of that weather girl
But, sir

613
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,320
I'm a scientist

614
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,249
That's why I need you

615
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,451
I want the same brilliant mind
that solved the unified field theory

616
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,081
to help me help Live Corp

617
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,880
Consider it done, sir

618
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,121
Good monkey

619
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,771
To the Helpicopter

620
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,203
Oh, Earl

621
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,202
Pull over there

622
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,488
Duck!
Duck? I love

623
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,727
Yeah!

624
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,405
You guys, that wasn't so bad

625
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,722
Yeah, well, be thankful
we didn't run into a

626
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,127
Cheespider!

627
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,047
Run!

628
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,401
Cheesy Cheesy Cheesy

629
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,571
Manny!

630
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,845
Wait for me!

631
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,649
I'm glad you still wearing
that diaper

632
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,928
I wish I brought a fresh one!

633
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,569
Hey, guys! Down this alley!

634
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,686
Oh, no! Dead end

635
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,842
Ghost man?

636
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,845
Greetings, and namaste

637
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,890
Chester V! You're here!
That's right.

638
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,289
Young Lockwood And by the
looks of things just in time.

639
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,524
One minute later, and we
would have been food for that food

640
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,765
Flint, I thought you said you were
going to complete this mission alone

641
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,166
Can I say something?

642
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,640
Apparently you can

643
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,570
This is Barb, my number two

644
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,241
Why are you carrying a strawberry
in your backpack, miss?

645
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,647
Stand back, everyone!

646
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,888
Hey, hey, hey, stop
You're scaring him

647
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,246
Scaring him?

648
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,643
Oh, please, it's probably
got a mouth full of fangs

649
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,930
Now you're scaring me

650
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,925
I've been carrying him
and he hasn't hurt anyone

651
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,845
I'm sorry Are you a scientist?

652
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,162
Matter of fact, I am
She's a meteorologist

653
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,283
Meteorology Oh, I love it

654
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,411
The science of smiling and having
pretty hair while you point at a map

655
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,802
It's a very important job
Meteorology is

656
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,580
a comprehensive analysis
Ladies, ladies Please

657
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,566
I'm sure we can all agree
that one of you is a scientist

658
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,168
Young Lockwood

659
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,325
why was your lady friend carrying this
rabid little strawberry in her backpack?

660
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,882
Why is the strawberry guy in
the backpack? Well, that's funny

661
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,409
It's You know what he did?

662
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,526
He.. He ate the BS-USB

663
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,206
Not the BS-USB

664
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,208
I'm on it

665
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,720
She's got a knife!

666
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,962
If you touch a leaf on his head

667
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,526
Step away from the berry, madam

668
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,367
That orange hairy lady
scared the jam out of him!

669
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,880
Nwoo?

670
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,150
Oh, no, it's jammed

671
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,243
Lick Lick Lick
Oh, thanks, Steve

672
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,600
Young Lockwood

673
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,569
The world could've been destroyed

674
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,242
because of the actions
of one sinister strawberry

675
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,529
We cannot allow any more mistakes
like this

676
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,480
It won't be long before
those malicious melons

677
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,080
pernicious pickles and belligerent
burgers learn to swim

678
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,201
and make their way
to the mainland

679
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,364
What is your plan?

680
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,330
I need to get back to my lab so I
can make contact with the FLDSMDFR

681
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,005
Brilliant!
I'll lead the way

682
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,601
No, we'll lead the way

683
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,205
Safe, safe, safe

684
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,886
I believe my Sentinels of Safety

685
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,051
are better equipped to lead us
in their robo suits

686
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,649
Nwoo?

687
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,287
"I'll be back before supper"

688
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,965
What a bunch of baloney

689
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,150
Just leave me on the boat
without any food

690
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,447
I know a place where
I can get something to eat

691
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,247
There she is

692
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,921
Home sweet home

693
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,529
What?

694
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,281
There's no sardines?

695
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,442
Had to be looters

696
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,566
Vintage Baby Brent

697
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,247
Oh, chum

698
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,284
No, no!

699
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,091
Yeah

700
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,131
I like them too I do I love them

701
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,725
Mine No, no Mine

702
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,490
Off Off Mine

703
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,451
No, no, mine Mine Off

704
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,963
Hey, hey, hey Easy, you guys
Come on, you could lose an eye

705
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,731
Look, I tell you what You want more
sardines? I can get you more sardines

706
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,764
Hey, thanks for loaning me
these skinny jeans, Flint

707
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,526
Those aren't skinny jeans Nope

708
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,367
My feet are turning purple
Is that bad?

709
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,324
Bananostrich!

710
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,009
Go, go, go! Come on, Brent!

711
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,844
Banana! Banana! Banana!

712
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,285
That bunch of bananostriches
nearly split us

713
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,087
Are you okay?

714
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,161
Oh, my gosh

715
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,521
My house!

716
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,443
Home, home, home!

717
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,330
Oh, my gosh

718
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,925
Your lab!

719
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,485
Oh, crap balls

720
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,688
We can't go up there, Flint Lockwood

721
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,122
That dangly, upsy downsy lab's
not to code

722
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,362
I've got to, if I'm gonna find
the FLDSMDFR

723
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,280
We can do it .Those load bearing vines
will be able to support a small team

724
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,925
Onwards and upwards!

725
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,969
Right, sir To the lab!

726
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,409
Sentinels, keep the locals safe

727
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,961
I'll keep them safe

728
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,362
Hey, guys! Where you going?
Guys! Hey

729
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,647
wait for me!

730
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,651
A little help?

731
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,567
Spooky

732
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,650
Spooky is right, Steve

733
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,365
I say this laboratory of yours
is a wonder of engineering

734
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,801
Really?

735
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,326
Thank you, sir

736
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,090
Initiating backup power

737
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,966
Welcome, Flint

738
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,690
Whoa, my computer's dead

739
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,125
The fate of the world is depending
on us Think, Lockwood

740
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,364
Well, if I could pull

741
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,720
the hard drive, there's enough
equipment in this

742
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,167
lab that I could build
a tracking device

743
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,323
Flint!

744
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,208
I say, young Lockwood,
what extraordinary

745
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,487
underpants

746
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,610
Thank you, sir They're
my Wedgie proof underwear

747
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,644
I invented them when I was 6

748
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,764
I had no idea we were so alike

749
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,889
Except I invented mine

750
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,963
when I was 3

751
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,009
You guys have been wearing the same
underwear since you were kids?

752
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,566
'Yes!
'Yes!

753
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,881
Excuse me

754
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,248
How do you expect us
to get the hard drive

755
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,648
with all that electrified water?

756
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,005
We dangle!

757
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,487
Come, Lockwood, give the monkey
your underpants

758
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,687
What?

759
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,443
Lay on

760
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,603
young Lockwood

761
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,007
Yes!

762
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,928
You know, hanging from
my underpants in this space

763
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,049
brings back so many memories

764
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,726
I too built my lab up high

765
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,849
to keep the bullies out!

766
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:31,929
You were

767
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,170
You were bullied too?

768
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,487
Absolutely

769
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,491
People like us

770
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,290
are always bullied

771
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,882
Sometimes I wish I'd kept
my bullies around

772
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,888
Really?

773
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,640
So I could crush them
with my success

774
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,689
Just like you did with that man baby

775
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,251
You mean Brent?

776
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,165
Sure, he used to be a bully,
but he's my friend now

777
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,208
Friend?

778
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,285
A bully can never be your friend

779
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,926
Never?
Remember

780
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,845
the ancient Chinese proverb:

781
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,522
"Stew offered by a bully
is poisoned broth"

782
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,091
Wow, stew

783
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,970
I have so much to learn

784
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,371
Mission accomplished!

785
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,922
Indeed, young Lockwood Indeed

786
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,526
Help!

787
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,249
Help! Come on, guys Get me out!

788
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,840
You okay, Earl?

789
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,321
My chest hairs
have been tingling all day

790
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,330
Don't worry Live Corp
Sentinels have danger

791
00:45:46,356 --> 00:45:49,187
sensing fibers built
into their chest plates

792
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,170
Bravo, Lockwood

793
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,971
With luck, we'll survive the night

794
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,368
Sounds like midnight snacks

795
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,126
Dr Manny! This is delicious!

796
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,488
I call it Manny's Gorilla Stew

797
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,529
So how do you make a gorilla stew?

798
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,569
You keep it waiting for two hours

799
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,410
Hey, guys Oh, that smells good

800
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,928
Hey, Flint! Wanna try some of this
special stew? I saved you a bowl

801
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,169
It's killer

802
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,606
Killer stew

803
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,289
No!

804
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,840
Thank you

805
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,726
Brent

806
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,649
Ever since that ghost man
showed up

807
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,962
Flint Lockwood's been acting
Jerky

808
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,605
He rejected my stew

809
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,161
No one has ever rejected my stew

810
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,649
I'm gonna go talk to him

811
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,928
Flint, wait up Yeah, Sam?

812
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,441
Is something wrong?

813
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,045
Yeah, we blew a fuse

814
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,725
You blew a fuse

815
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,367
Why are you being so weird
to your friends?

816
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,250
What? I haven't been weird

817
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,323
You karate chopped

818
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,211
Manny's stew out of Brent's hands

819
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,805
You hurt their feelings

820
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,042
Sam, you wouldn't understand

821
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,285
I do understand,
but you're forgetting that:

822
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,925
"A bully turned friend
will be friend to the end"

823
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,645
Listen, Brent came here to help you

824
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,086
We all did

825
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,323
And you're acting like
we're just in your way

826
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,007
Remember, we work together

827
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,161
That weather girl is ruining our plan

828
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,050
I just need more time, sir

829
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,441
We don't have more time

830
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,570
If we don't get the FLDSMDFR
in the next 48 hours

831
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,690
we'll miss our deadline
to release Food Bar 8.0

832
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,160
I'll be a laughingstock!

833
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,568
Sir, let me handle this

834
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,883
Never send a monkey
to do Chester work

835
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,685
I'll take care of it

836
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,686
Okay, guys, we're here

837
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,688
Hey, hey, hey!

838
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,564
That is not for you

839
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,010
All right, let's get to it

840
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,888
Okay

841
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,121
You got this, right?

842
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,123
Okay Then you wanna put
one of these on there, like that

843
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,488
No, no, no

844
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,405
No, don't eat that That's bad
You'll hurt yourself

845
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,371
Hey, hey, easy! Stop picking
on your brother, will you?

846
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,728
How would you like it
if he was shoving you?

847
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,325
Okay, now watch

848
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,281
Are you watching?
One and two and three!

849
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,444
Catch the big one!

850
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,486
Yeah, good, huh?

851
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,042
It's called fishing

852
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,650
 Out on my boat 

853
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,848
 With a pickle that likes dill 

854
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,923
 The frowny one's sour 

855
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,242
 He's a real bitter pill 

856
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,409
 She's so sweet 

857
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,847
 With her onion pet Pearl 

858
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,690
 Teaching pickles to fish 

859
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,321
 That's my crazy world 

860
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,040
I tell you, if only Flint liked fishing
as much as you guys

861
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,004
Why am I talking to a pickle?

862
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,282
Dangerous food creatures detected

863
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,000
Stay put We'll find and destroy them

864
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,366
Barry!

865
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,926
You can't be here

866
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,961
You better hide him

867
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,400
Okay, gang! Today's the day

868
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,244
We find the FLDSMDFR

869
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,570
Sam, I was thinking about
what you said last night

870
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,449
Nwoo?

871
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,283
What?

872
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,681
Me too

873
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,631
Right Listen, I have been acting weird, but
it's only because I'm under a lot of pressure.

874
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,807
Nwoo?
What?

875
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,366
So true!

876
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,490
But I'm also doing this for us
You see

877
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,008
I still want Sparks-wood
to happen, but it can't

878
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,686
Not until I become a great inventor
like Chester V

879
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,406
Flint, you don't have to
prove anything

880
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,570
Lockwood! How goes the inventing?

881
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,726
Very good, sir I was up all night
making this

882
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,042
I call it the Flint Lockwood
Food Jungle

883
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,362
Topographical Pointing Machine

884
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,881
Or
The FLFJTPM! Brilliant!

885
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,771
Oh, thank you, sir Follow the beam,
find the machine

886
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,804
All I have to do now
is cut the leg holes

887
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,125
Well maybe it's better here

888
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,361
Great idea, Sam

889
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,450
And, guys, you can help me by

890
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,002
Excuse us Your friends are
distracting you from our mission

891
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,889
Distracting?

892
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,605
My chest hairs just
don't trust that Chester

893
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,247
We should be hunting
the FLDSMDFR, not chitchatting

894
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,285
But, sir, I ..You're heading into the
deepest, darkest part of the jungle

895
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,126
You need to focus on
saving the world.

896
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,647
Be a hero.

897
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,530
Okay You're right, sir

898
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,161
Excellent! Let's go!

899
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,724
Okay, Barry, time to go home now

900
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,687
Okay Okay
Okay, one more hug, Barry

901
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,842
Barry?

902
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,122
Right! Barry

903
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,930
You Barry

904
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,082
Barry

905
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,164
And I'm Sam Sparks

906
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,326
Saspa
Right! Sam

907
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,130
Come on, Sam!
Coming!

908
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,170
Okay, Barry, time to go home now
Now go

909
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,927
Now you go on home

910
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,361
Bye

911
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,651
Saspa

912
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,884
Hot dog Hot dog

913
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,847
Tacodile! Supreme!

914
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,730
Holy guacamole!

915
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,086
I got this, bro!

916
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,885
I'm okay!

917
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,929
Up there! Hurry, Sam!

918
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,407
Barb!

919
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,001
You Okay?

920
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,281
Freeze!

921
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,281
Come on, let's go!
Let's get out of here!

922
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,367
Bravo, young Lockwood, bravo!

923
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,769
A mother?

924
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,962
Sam!

925
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,286
SaSpa!

926
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,561
Butter

927
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,211
Park-ay

928
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,010
Almost there

929
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,525
The FLDSMDFR
should be just across

930
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,484
this syrup bog This is syrup?

931
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,049
Syrup is my favorite

932
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,328
Darn mosquitoasts!

933
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,162
Don't worry, man baby

934
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,329
They, like all the other abominable
food monsters will soon be no more

935
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,607
Wait, Flint!

936
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,601
What if we're making a big mistake?

937
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,406
Mistake?

938
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,642
About shutting off the FLDSMDFR

939
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,850
Some of these creatures,
they're incredible..

940
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,010
Incredibly dangerous. We were just
attacked by a giant tacodile

941
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,323
He's right, Sam I mean, we were
almost eaten by a cheespider

942
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,450
It doesn't mean we have to
destroy all of them

943
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,371
Some of the food's
actually been friendly

944
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,849
It is true The dessert creatures
are especially sweet

945
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,083
Okay Maybe we

946
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,682
Mosquitoast!

947
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,763
Was gonna bite you

948
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,651
See? Even the tiniest creatures
are attacking us

949
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,801
The only reason they're

950
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,161
biting is because of the drop
in barometric pressure

951
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,569
Bugs do that before a storm And by
the look of those nimbostratus clouds

952
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,405
Miss Sparks, we are

953
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,369
not talking about the weather

954
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,410
We are talking about food here

955
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,122
Dangerous food that does not
have human emotion

956
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,328
Food that is not friendly

957
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,087
Food that cannot love!
Flint

958
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,642
we should be studying
the food animals, not killing them

959
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,445
What if he's wrong?

960
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,249
The choice is yours, son

961
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,369
Live up to your full potential

962
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,241
or walk away and let the food
monsters destroy Lady Liberty

963
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,167
Sam, finding that FLDSMDFR

964
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,687
and saving the world
that's what matters

965
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,764
Really? Our opinion doesn't matter?

966
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,047
Of course it does!

967
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,209
Yes! Yes, it matters

968
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,807
But just not right now

969
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,560
Wrong answer Toast

970
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,870
Yeah? Well, I guess
this doesn't matter either

971
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,884
young Lockwood

972
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,008
I'll just

973
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,446
see you back on the boat

974
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,490
Wait! Sam!

975
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,091
Wait, please!

976
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,448
No! No Sam! Come back!

977
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,370
Come back, Sam, no!

978
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,051
No, Sam!

979
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,442
Sam! Sam!

980
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,220
Sand!

981
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,570
Hey, Earl, would you talk to her?

982
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,847
You bet I will

983
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,122
Hey, Sam! Wait for me!

984
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,883
Goodbye, Senor Lockwood

985
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,082
Bye, Flint

986
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,560
Steve!

987
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,484
Et tu, Steve?

988
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,007
What just happened?

989
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,003
You've made

990
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,401
the right choice, son

991
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,570
Sentinels! Keep them safe

992
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,685
Butter

993
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,329
Young Lockwood

994
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,564
we're getting close
I feel it in my beard!

995
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,924
Water goes in the top

996
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,845
and food comes out the bottom

997
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,040
It's gotta be inside that
big rock candy mountain!

998
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,528
This is exactly why I wanted you
on this mission

999
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,928
Sally forth, Lockwood

1000
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,884
I can't believe Flint
is still listening to that guy!

1001
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,726
Flint is naive It appears
he is being manipulated

1002
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,564
for some nefarious purpose

1003
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,650
Of course he is!

1004
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,126
Sam! Freeze!

1005
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,322
What?

1006
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,325
Stay calm and walk toward me

1007
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,642
slowly

1008
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,089
Very slowly

1009
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,324
Oh, come on
Now you're acting weird

1010
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,050
I'm in no mood for this

1011
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,090
Stop right there, cheese monster!

1012
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,845
Nobody eats my friends

1013
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,366
on my watch!

1014
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,682
No, wait! Chester's been lying to us about
these creatures, and I am going to prove it

1015
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,649
Sam, don't do it!

1016
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,848
It's foodicide!

1017
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,931
Danger! Danger! Danger!

1018
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,531
Nice cheespider

1019
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,360
Yellow Dude!

1020
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,160
You got specialsauced!

1021
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,442
Its Okay, guys See?

1022
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,125
She's not mean She's just

1023
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,691
a little beefy

1024
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,161
What's it doing?

1025
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,846
I think she wants you
to scratch her buns

1026
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,366
I like that too

1027
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,244
Who's a good cheespider?

1028
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,961
She's cute!

1029
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,884
But why did she attack us before?

1030
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,690
Because we were dressed

1031
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,046
like them

1032
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,961
She doesn't like backpacks?

1033
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,086
No It appears she

1034
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,441
doesn't like Live Corp

1035
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,887
The food creatures know something

1036
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,082
we do not

1037
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,728
Gasp!

1038
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,240
Who's Evel?

1039
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,910
Not "Evel" Evil

1040
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,070
I knew it! Chester's
up to something terrible

1041
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,407
We have to warn Flint!

1042
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,368
Let's ride!

1043
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,568
Run!

1044
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,447
You're not warning

1045
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,529
anyone about anything

1046
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,410
Oh, crap balls

1047
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,010
Magnificent

1048
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,049
The FLDSMDFR

1049
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,566
must be up there

1050
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,327
A very unpleasant fall

1051
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,040
Finish the job, Lockwood

1052
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,566
Yes, sir

1053
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,011
Made it!

1054
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,246
FLDSMDFR

1055
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,208
Look, I'm sorry I have to
do this to you

1056
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,606
again

1057
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,844
But I can't let your swimming
cheespiders destroy Lady Liberty

1058
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:05,729
or the world

1059
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,649
Marshmallow

1060
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:39,923
They're like

1061
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,525
a family

1062
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,684
Sam was right

1063
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,127
This is a mistake

1064
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,722
Oh, dear!

1065
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,883
Sir! Sir?
There it is

1066
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,208
Wait In all its glory

1067
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,320
Chester, look, I can't do this

1068
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,647
Oh, okay I will

1069
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,847
What? Wait

1070
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,089
Chester, wait We can't destroy it

1071
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,044
Let go of me, Lockwood

1072
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,430
No, sir, I can't let you do this

1073
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,761
No! No! No!

1074
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,167
Live Corp

1075
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,050
The BS-USB

1076
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,566
reprogrammed it?

1077
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,649
It was never gonna
turn off the machine

1078
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,402
A BS-USB? Hello

1079
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,923
Your machine is what I wanted
all along

1080
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,851
You lied to me

1081
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,525
Of course I lied to you

1082
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,969
I knew you'd eventually fall
for these pathetic creatures

1083
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,763
But you were my idol

1084
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,005
My whole life, I looked up to you
I wanted to be you!

1085
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,091
Oh, Lockwood I was just using you

1086
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,810
to get your invention

1087
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:17,967
We're ready

1088
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,242
Launch Operation Slice and Dice

1089
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,404
And now that I've got what I want,
I no longer need you

1090
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,729
I'm afraid we're going to have to
let you go

1091
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,281
Wait, wait, wait No, no, please

1092
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,531
That's not natural

1093
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,761
No, no, no

1094
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,361
Easy, easy, you guys Don't cry

1095
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,002
Okay, Steve If me and you put
our two brilliant minds together

1096
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,890
we will get out of here

1097
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,088
Steve?
Brent, do you ever get

1098
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,370
the feeling that maybe Steve Lockwood
is just a monkey?

1099
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,325
Why would you say that
about him, Earl?

1100
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,126
Why would you ever say that?

1101
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,081
Of course he's just a monkey
How stupid are you people?

1102
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,648
No one should ever put
any trust in a monkey

1103
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,803
Chester thinks you're a monkey

1104
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,771
Well, I'm an ape Chester knows that

1105
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,208
But he calls you a monkey

1106
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,080
It is true, he does

1107
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,004
He's just joking around

1108
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,686
Chester's my best friend

1109
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,405
If Chester was really your friend

1110
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,990
would he still call you a monkey?

1111
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,249
Nwoo! Nwoo!

1112
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:17,790
Flint

1113
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,180
Dad

1114
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,590
What's happening, son?
You look terrible

1115
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,885
What's with all of them?
They saved my life

1116
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,765
I let Chester steal the machine and now
he's starting Operation Slice and Dice

1117
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,289
Come on, son You're really
not making any sense

1118
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,091
Look, Chester's gonna wipe out
all the foodimals

1119
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,886
My friends tried to tell me they
were good, but I didn't listen

1120
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,288
Everything I touch just gets ruined

1121
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,522
Nwoo!
Barry?

1122
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,249
Nwoo!

1123
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,285
Barry I'm so sorry I misjudged you

1124
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,045
I should have listened to Sam

1125
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,848
Saspa Sam
What is it? What are you trying to say?

1126
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,970
Saspa, Saspa

1127
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,321
Saspa!

1128
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,570
Saspa

1129
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,330
Sassy pants Dad

1130
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,640
Saspa, Saspa!

1131
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,211
Sam and the gang?

1132
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,041
It looks like a Sentinel of Safety

1133
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,002
Sassy pants

1134
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,921
Sassy pants? No, Dad He's saying
Sentinels captured Sam and the gang

1135
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,241
And they're being held in the factory?
We gotta get them out of there

1136
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,370
But how? There's just two of us

1137
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,040
Nwoo!

1138
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,406
Nwoo!
Nwoo! Nwoo!

1139
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,610
Nwoo!
Nwoo!

1140
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,001
Nwoo!

1141
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,410
Hey, what's with all the "Nwoos"?

1142
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,051
Why do they have my TV?

1143
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,605
Water goes in the top
and food comes out the bottom

1144
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,805
Nwoo! Nwoo!

1145
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,040
What's it, broken or something?
What's it doing?

1146
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,009
Nwoo!

1147
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,445
Here, you take it, you take it

1148
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,927
Nwoo

1149
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,687
It's saying that I'm Nwoo Nwoo

1150
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,570
Nwoo Nwoo

1151
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,605
Nwoo
Look, Flint, they came here to help

1152
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,081
We all did It's time to let us

1153
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,048
Okay, I don't know
if you can understand me

1154
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,962
I know you think I'm Nwoo
I know you think I'm Nwoo

1155
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,170
But the truth is I'm no Nwoo

1156
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,289
I'm just a man

1157
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,281
A man who's made a lot of mistakes
in the last couple of days

1158
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,725
And now my friends are in
a lot of trouble, thanks to me

1159
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,250
Someone once told me
that I didn't need friends

1160
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,807
That I could accomplish more
by myself

1161
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,725
I know now more than ever

1162
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,610
that he was wrong

1163
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,286
We need all the friends we can get

1164
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,649
And I need your help
All of you Fruits

1165
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,928
vegetables and meat!

1166
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,362
I need you to help me
to get into that

1167
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,090
factory, save our friends

1168
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,001
and get our home back!

1169
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,230
Okay, now I just gotta figure out

1170
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,209
how to get in there

1171
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,330
With the right rod and tackle,
I could cast you up

1172
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,320
into that unfinished part
of the factory

1173
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,965
Should be a piece of cake

1174
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,604
Dad, let's go fishing

1175
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,842
Wildebeets!

1176
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,528
Meatballrus! Go, go, go!

1177
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,569
Watermelophant, do your thing!

1178
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,887
Spray On Shoes

1179
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,201
Hair Un Balder

1180
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,169
Grocery Deliverator

1181
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,086
Helmet

1182
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,248
Got it

1183
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,364
Ready when you are, Dad!

1184
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,807
Ready, skipper, my boy

1185
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,687
It's too heavy!

1186
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,528
Here comes the cavalry

1187
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,766
No way! Subs!

1188
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,490
Subwhales!
Subwhales!

1189
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,726
Prepare to release lure

1190
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,762
Hit it, Sweet

1191
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,484
Catch the big one, buddy

1192
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,327
Yes!

1193
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,830
We have a problem

1194
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,841
Nwoo, in here

1195
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,843
What's going on?

1196
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,084
Sam's backpack

1197
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,767
They were here!

1198
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,801
Good cheespider

1199
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,246
Saspa?

1200
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,327
Got it, Barry

1201
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,361
Thanks, cheespider

1202
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,644
Nwoo!

1203
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,527
Barry, use the Grocery Deliverator
to save your friends

1204
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,609
I'll go save mine

1205
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,450
There's a leek in my boat

1206
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,728
Flint!

1207
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,361
Go, go, go!

1208
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,369
Hey

1209
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,243
freeze!

1210
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,010
Food fight!

1211
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,450
Crab cakes!

1212
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,643
Run!

1213
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,849
I'm all cheesed up

1214
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,682
Retreat!

1215
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,689
Retreat!

1216
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,771
Head scan complete

1217
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,008
Lockwood?

1218
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,566
You're still alive?

1219
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,840
That's right Hands up
Give me back my friends

1220
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,811
Of course! I have them right here

1221
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,846
Hey, Flint

1222
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,366
Sam! Guys!

1223
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,931
Chester, let them go!

1224
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,731
Don't worry, Lockwood,
I'll let them go

1225
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,606
Right into my supersized
Food Bar machine

1226
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,371
Food Bars?

1227
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,928
Food Bars? You're going to
turn them into Food Bars?

1228
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,006
Yes, Food Bars
The lifeblood of my company

1229
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:59,290
I learned your FLDSMDFR food
is far more delicious than "food" food

1230
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,409
So using your foodimals
as ingredients

1231
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,927
would make my products
superdelicious!

1232
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,043
I had to have your invention

1233
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,601
Unfortunately, I couldn't find it

1234
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,806
Until you helped me

1235
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,645
FLDSMDFR!

1236
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,246
Watermelon!

1237
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,769
You're a monster!
Those are living creatures

1238
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,161
Yes, that's the problem

1239
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,611
Food with legs
is much harder to catch

1240
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,510
They hide, they fight back,
they want to live

1241
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,240
But now that I control
your FLDSMDFR

1242
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,366
I can pave your island
and work in complete secrecy

1243
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,965
Live Corp will remain

1244
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,846
the coolest, hippest company
in the world

1245
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,009
with a new Food Bar version

1246
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,645
80!

1247
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,320
I never should have believed in you

1248
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,289
Yes, that was quite foolish

1249
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,081
Now if you want your friends back,
I suggest you drop your cans

1250
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,051
Don't do it, Flint! Save the island!

1251
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,124
But you are my island

1252
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,328
Okay, first, shut up

1253
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,689
Then drop the cans
or I drop your friends

1254
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,001
Okay, okay There

1255
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,246
Oh, no, Flint This is embarrassing
I changed my mind

1256
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,602
Please understand
I can't leave any witnesses

1257
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,406
Barb, grind them

1258
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,060
But, sir, I didn't think we were going to
This is why I work alone

1259
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,202
Monkey!

1260
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,044
You are dismissed

1261
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,801
And now, without

1262
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,411
further ado

1263
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,240
Flint, hurry!

1264
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,005
Why won't this go faster?

1265
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,210
Give me that controller!
Sure, come and get it

1266
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,806
But which one of us has it?

1267
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:43,962
Is it me?

1268
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,361
Or me?

1269
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,484
Earl, can't you break
us out of here?

1270
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,082
Yellow police tape!
The one thing I can't break

1271
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,690
Forkenknifenspooninator!

1272
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,168
Sam, guys, listen

1273
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,726
Invisible coffee table!

1274
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,851
I'm sorry I was such an idiot

1275
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,728
Flint, that's true but
now may not be the time!

1276
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,327
Please let me finish
I took you all for granted

1277
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,005
I should have listened to you

1278
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,641
Okay, go on But hurry!

1279
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,003
The truth is I need each
and every one of you guys

1280
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,846
You're more than my friends
You're my family

1281
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,807
How sweet Note to self:
put that on their tombstones

1282
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,530
Good one, Chester!

1283
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,450
Don't you see, young Lockwood?

1284
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,087
These friends are the reason
you keep losing

1285
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,607
Well, it's better than ending up
alone like you

1286
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,080
I'm not alone!

1287
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,851
I've got holograms!

1288
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,510
Flint! Why don't you throw him
a party?

1289
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,727
We love parties

1290
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,411
Party?

1291
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,161
Party!

1292
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,887
Party's over, Lockwood

1293
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,047
No!

1294
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,207
Not yet

1295
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,966
I think it's time to celebrate!

1296
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,290
No!

1297
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,364
Celebrate!

1298
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,008
Yes!

1299
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,444
Thanks, lab partner Helping!

1300
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,726
Guys, I'm

1301
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,243
so sorry for being such a Chester!
Okay, I guess I deserve that

1302
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,369
No, Flint! Chester!

1303
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,167
I've got what I want
Enjoy your friends, Lockwood

1304
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,811
No! No!

1305
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,810
Don't do this!

1306
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,402
Food!

1307
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,851
Anybody gonna be keeping
folks safe in this town, it's me

1308
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,322
Tacodile supreme

1309
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,368
It's over, Chester

1310
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,683
Mustache!
Now hand over the FLDSMDFR

1311
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,450
No! Never!

1312
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,602
Chester

1313
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,405
there's nowhere to go

1314
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,325
That's what you think

1315
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,210
Save me, monkey!

1316
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,360
Rm an ape!

1317
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,329
Bad monkey! Give that back!
Bad monk!

1318
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,764
My holograms! Save me!

1319
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,922
We're here for you

1320
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,208
You're going to be fine
We'll save you

1321
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,006
You see, Flint?
With my holograms

1322
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,485
Oh, fudge

1323
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,689
I saved myself

1324
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,328
That will leave a bad taste
in your mouth

1325
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,446
I believe this belongs to you

1326
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:37,931
Here you go, Pal

1327
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,603
Gosh, I hope this works

1328
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,127
Pickle

1329
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,282
Cheeseburger

1330
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,767
Leek Strawberry Lemon

1331
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,650
Yes!
Banana

1332
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,044
It's enough to make a grown man cry

1333
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,680
And that's okay

1334
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,442
You go right ahead, tear

1335
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,208
Guys, do you think we could
still work together?

1336
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,882
I think we will work great together

1337
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,885
Come on, bring it on in, Barb

1338
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,324
This is nice

1339
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,361
Ape!

1340
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,369
Monkey

1341
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,091
I'm proud of you, son

1342
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,446
Thanks, Dad

1343
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,167
But there's one last thing
I need to do

1344
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,323
Okay, now, son
Now, once you put it on like that

1345
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,284
all you have to do is cast it

1346
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,324
So like this?

1347
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,802
No, no, no
Here, let me show you how

1348
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,990
See, it's all in the wrist Like this

1349
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,630
Catch the big one, boy

1350
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,609
Am I fishing?
Yup

1351
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,569
I'm fishing!

1352
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,070
You've got a live one
Now reel him in, Flint

1353
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,884
That's it Steady, steady
He's a fighter!

1354
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,685
I got one!

1355
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,809
I got one, Dad!
Okay

1356
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,290
Can we do this again?
Like all the time?

1357
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,246
You betcha, skipper

1358
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,444
Sam, guys, I caught my first fish!

1359
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,610
Way to go, Flint!

1360
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,950
Flint Lockwood, you are a fisherman

1361
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,446
Happy

1362
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,110
Hey, look, rainbows!

1363
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,281
Strawberry

1364
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,886
Hi, Steve

1365
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,980
Hello, Steven I'm Barb

So do you wanna
go get coffee sometime?

Dinner!

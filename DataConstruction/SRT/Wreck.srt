1
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,469
My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy.

2
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,976
Let's see. I'm nine feet tall.
I weigh 643 pounds.

3
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,144
Got a little bit of a temper on me.

4
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,942
My passion bubbles
very near the surface,

5
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,986
I guess, not gonna lie.

6
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:11,990
Anyhoo, what else? Uh...

7
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:15,785
I'm a wrecker. I wreck things.
Professionally.

8
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:20,456
I'm very good at what I do.
Probably the best I know.

9
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,586
The thing is, fixing
is the name of the game.

10
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,337
Literally, Fix-It Felix, Jr.

11
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:27,505
Fix it, Felix!

12
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,175
So, yeah, naturally,

13
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:34,012
the guy with the name
Fix-It Felix is the good guy.

14
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,972
He's nice enough as good guys go.

15
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,974
Definitely fixes stuff really well.

16
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,186
But, uh, if you've got a magic hammer
from your father,

17
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,855
how hard can it be?

18
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:47,191
If he was a regular contractor
carpenter guy,

19
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:49,736
I guarantee you would not be able

20
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,863
to fix the damage that I do as quickly.

21
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,867
And when Felix does
a good job, he gets a medal.

22
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,079
But are there medals for
wrecking stuff really well?

23
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,040
To that I say, Ha!

24
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,752
And, no, there aren't.

25
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,049
Thirty years I've been doing this

26
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,926
and I've seen a lot of
other games come and go.

27
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:17,180
Kind of sad. I think about
all those guys from Asteroids.

28
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,641
Boom! Gone. Centipede?

29
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,559
Who knows where
that guy is, you know?

30
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,646
Look, a steady arcade gig
is nothing to sneeze at.

31
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:25,855
I'm very lucky.

32
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,317
It's just, I got to say,

33
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,944
it becomes kind of hard to love your job

34
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:34,280
when no one seems to
like you for doing it.

35
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,536
All clear! The arcade is closed!

36
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,205
Shoryuken!

37
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:46,292
Whoo! What a day! You want to
head to Tappers, Ken?

38
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,835
If you're buying, buddy.

39
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:52,965
Quitting time!

40
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,688
I don't know.

41
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:08,314
Maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way

42
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,441
if things were different after work.

43
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,944
But it is what it is.

44
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,112
Good job, everyone!

45
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,655
Felix and the Nicelanders

46
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,615
go hang out in their homes

47
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,284
which he's just fixed,
and everyone, you know...

48
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,164
They go to their homes, I go to mine

49
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,126
which happens to be a dump.

50
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,877
And when I say a dump,

51
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,295
I don't mean like a shabby place.

52
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,881
I mean an actual dump,

53
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,134
where the garbage goes

54
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,512
and a bunch of bricks
and smashed building parts...

55
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,181
That's what I call home.

56
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,475
I guess I can't bellyache too much.

57
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:47,145
I got my bricks, I got my stump.

58
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:54,235
It looks uncomfortable.
It's actually fine. I'm good.

59
00:03:57,822 --> 00:04:02,493
But if I'm really honest with myself...

60
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:07,331
I see Felix up there
getting patted on the back,

61
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:11,502
people are giving him pie
and thanking him

62
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,672
and so happy to see him all the time.

63
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,924
Sometimes I think...

64
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:22,180
Man, it sure must be nice
being the good guy.

65
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,560
Nice share, Ralph.

66
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,020
As fellow bad guys,

67
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,521
we've all felt what you're feeling

68
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,023
and we've come to terms with it.

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,566
Really?
Right here.

70
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:35,693
I am Zangief. I am bad guy.

71
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,945
Hi, Zangief!
Hi, Zangief.

72
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,073
I relate to you, Ralph.
When I hit bottom,

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,700
I was crushing man's skull

74
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,536
like sparrow egg between my thighs.

75
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,832
And I think, Why do you have
to be so bad, Zangief?

76
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,376
Why can't you be more like good guy?

77
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,046
Then I have moment of clarity.

78
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,048
If Zangief is good guy,

79
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,091
who'll crush man's skull

80
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,385
like sparrow's egg between thighs?

81
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,638
And I say, Zangief, you are bad guy,

82
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:07,099
but this does not mean
you are 'bad' guy.

83
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:13,231
Right. I'm sorry. You lost me there.

84
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,816
Zombie! Bad guy!
Hi, Zombie.

85
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,234
Hi, Zombie.

86
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:19,779
Zangief saying
labels not make you happy.

87
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,073
Good! Bad!

88
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,576
You must love you.

89
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,995
Yeah! Inside here!
Yes.

90
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,165
Okay. All right, I get you.
Watch out. It's dripping.

91
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,333
Question, Ralph.

92
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,961
We've been asking you
to Bad-Anon for years now

93
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:38,130
and tonight you finally show up.

94
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:40,007
Why is that?
I don't know.

95
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,425
I just felt like coming.

96
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,847
I suppose it has
something to do with the fact that...

97
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:49,141
Well, today is the 30th
anniversary of my game.

98
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,143
Well, happy anniversary, Ralph.

99
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,478
Thanks, Satan.

100
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,106
Uh, it's Sateen, actually.

101
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,441
Got it. But here's the thing.

102
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,863
I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

103
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:07,326
You can't mess with
the program, Ralph.

104
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,079
You're not going Turbo, are you?

105
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:13,499
Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo!
Come on, guys!

106
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,502
Is it Turbo to want a friend?
Or a medal?

107
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,546
Or a piece of pie every once in a while?

108
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,339
Is it Turbo to want more out of life?

109
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,799
Yes!

110
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:23,801
Ralph, Ralph, we get it.

111
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,845
But we can't change who we are.

112
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,179
And the sooner you accept that,

113
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,641
the better off your game
and your life will be.

114
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,936
Hey. One game at a time, Ralph.

115
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,564
Let's close out with
the Bad Guy Affirmation.

116
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,155
I'm bad, and that's good.

117
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,992
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

118
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,369
There's no one I'd rather be than me.

119
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,414
Okay, gang,
see you next week.

120
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,416
Listen, I can't do
snacks next week.

121
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,043
Hang in there, Ralph.

122
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,545
Hey, Zombie,
don't forget your hatchets.

123
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,713
There you go.

124
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,110
Step aside, sir. Random security check.

125
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,278
Random my behind!
You always stop me.

126
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,614
I'm just a surge protector
doing my job, sir.

127
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,408
Name?
Lara Croft.

128
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,076
Name?
Wreck-It Ralph!

129
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,577
And where are you coming from?

130
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,079
Uh... Pac-Man.

131
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,580
Did you bring any fruit with you?

132
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,124
No! No. No fruit.

133
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,583
Okay, then. Where are you heading?

134
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,668
Fix-It Felix Jr.

135
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,586
Anything to declare?
I hate you.

136
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,422
I get that a lot. Proceed.

137
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,553
Bad guy coming!

138
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,931
If you leave your game,

139
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,933
stay safe, stay alert,

140
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,394
and whatever you do, don't die.

141
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,646
Because if you die
outside your own game

142
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,273
you don't regenerate.

143
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,108
Ever. Game over.

144
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,327
Here you go, buddy.

145
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,498
It's fresh. Straight from Pac-Man's.

146
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,125
Hang in there, guys.

147
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,626
Name?

148
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,348
Celebrate good times
Come on!

149
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,831
Happy 30th Anniversary?

150
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,250
They're having a party without me.

151
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,756
Pac-Man? They invited Pac-Man?

152
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,258
That cherry-chasing dot-muncher

153
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,760
isn't even part of this game!

154
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,678
Great party, Felix.

155
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,097
Why, thank you, friend.

156
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,057
Felix. You're needed on the dance floor!

157
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,104
Whoo!

158
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:08,025
Fix-It Felix!
Whoo-whoo! Fix-It Felix!

159
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:10,861
Oh! I'll bet that's Mario.

160
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,280
Fashionably late, per the norm.

161
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,907
I'll get it, Felix.

162
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,703
Ahh!

163
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,747
It's Ralph!

164
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,042
He'll wreck the party!
Hide the stemware!

165
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,085
Get rid of him, Felix.

166
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,879
Oh, right. I'll go talk to him.

167
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,548
Carry on, everyone.

168
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,468
Ralph, can I help you?

169
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,387
Hey, Felix.
Just wanted to check on you.

170
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,430
I saw a big explosion

171
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,891
or something go over the building there.

172
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,644
Oh, those were just fireworks.

173
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,146
Fireworks. Okay. Phewf.

174
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,939
Somebody's birthday, or...

175
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:51,277
Well, it's more of an anniversary.

176
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,988
The 30th anniversary
of our game, actually.

177
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,031
What? Is that today?

178
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,241
I know!

179
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,742
I'm such a dummy with dates.

180
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,120
Anyway, uh, congratulations.

181
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,415
Thank you, Ralph. And to you, too.

182
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,087
Uh...

183
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,340
Hi. Just a heads-up, Felix.

184
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,466
They're bringing out the cake
in a few shakes.

185
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,386
Hey, Glen.
Ralph.

186
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:21,515
Cake? Heard about this cake stuff.

187
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,808
Never had it.

188
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,268
No one ever seems to throw it out

189
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,436
so it never ends up in the dump.

190
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,272
I never actually tasted it. Uh...

191
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,108
I've always wanted to try cake.

192
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,944
I don't suppose you'd like to

193
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,613
come in and have a slice, would you?

194
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,115
Hey-o, everybody! Oh!

195
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,325
Ah!

196
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,582
I'm okay. I'm okay. Fit as a fiddle.

197
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,461
Now, you all know Ralph.
Evening.

198
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,049
Evening, Nell, Lucy, Don, Dana...

199
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,967
Deanna.
Big Gene!

200
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,427
Why is he here?

201
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,679
He's just here for a slice of cake.

202
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,556
And I'm a big part of the game,

203
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,141
technically speaking.

204
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,976
Why are you here, Gene?

205
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,519
Oh, look! The cake!

206
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,984
Well, I'll be dipped. You've
really outdone yourself, Mary.

207
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,487
Oh, and look!
There's all of us at the top.

208
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,949
Each apartment
is everyone's favorite flavor.

209
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,659
Norwood's is red velvet.

210
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:22,743
Guilty!

211
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,330
And lemon for Lucy, rum cake for Gene,

212
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,873
and for Felix...
Hey, Mary.

213
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,333
Um...

214
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,503
What's the flavor of that mud
that I'm stuck in there?

215
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,506
Hmm? Oh. Chocolate.

216
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,092
I've never been real fond of chocolate.

217
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,010
Well, I did not know that.

218
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,345
One other little thing.

219
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:44,932
I hate to be picky,
but this angry little guy here...

220
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,017
My cake!
...might be a lot happier

221
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,478
if you put him up here
with everyone else.

222
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,689
See that? Look at that smile.

223
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,857
No, no. You see, Ralph,

224
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,026
there's no room for you up here.

225
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,613
What about this?
We can make room.

226
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,408
Here. We could take turns. Easy.

227
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,369
How about we just eat the cake?

228
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,871
Hang on. Felix needs to be on the roof

229
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,873
because he's about to get his medal!

230
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,251
Then how about we just take that medal

231
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,711
and give it to Ralph for once?

232
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,379
Would that be
the end of the world, Gene?

233
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,214
Now you're just being ridiculous.

234
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,049
Only good guys win medals,

235
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,635
and you, sir, are no good guy.

236
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,220
I could be a good guy if I wanted to,

237
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,388
and I could win a medal!

238
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,349
Uh-huh. And when you do,
come and talk to us.

239
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,144
Then would you finally let me be
on top of the cake with you guys?

240
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,270
If you won a medal,

241
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,272
we'd let you live
up here in the penthouse!

242
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,316
But it will never happen

243
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,485
because you're just the bad guy
who wrecks the building.

244
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,154
No, I'm not.

245
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,405
Yes, you are!

246
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,157
No, I'm not!

247
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,752
Yes, you are.

248
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,922
All right, Gene. You know what?

249
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,507
I'm going to win a medal.

250
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,093
Oh, I am going to win a medal!

251
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,096
The shiniest medal
this place has ever seen!

252
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,599
A medal that will be so good

253
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,685
that it will make Felix's
medals wet their pants!

254
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,356
And good night!
Thank you for the party.

255
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,108
Is he serious?
Oh, please!

256
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,361
Where's a bad guy
going to win a medal?

257
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,488
Of course he's not serious.

258
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,991
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

259
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,701
That's why I came
straight here, Tapper.

260
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,286
You've never given me a bum steer.

261
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,123
Now, come on. Where can a guy
like me go and win a medal?

262
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,459
I don't think such a game exists, Ralph.

263
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,170
Oh, come on. You know people.
There's got to be...

264
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,463
Tapper, I need a root beer.

265
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,048
Coming! Hold that thought.

266
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,807
Okay. As you were saying.

267
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,935
I was saying,
I can't spend another 30 years

268
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,353
living alone in the garbage.

269
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,271
I'm not going back without a medal.

270
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,856
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

271
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,275
Maybe somebody left a medal here.

272
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,611
You're welcome to dig
through the lost and found.

273
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,364
Okay, let's see what we got here.

274
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,658
Oh! Shoo! Shoo! Go on, get out of here.

275
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,620
Mushroom? No.

276
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,248
What is this? No.

277
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,293
Oh, come on, Zangief! Gross.

278
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,337
Oh.

279
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,005
What am I doing?

280
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,551
Hey, excuse you!
We are humanity's last hope.

281
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,387
Our mission? Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

282
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,723
We are humanity's last hope.

283
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,435
Uh... You okay there, space cadet?

284
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,353
We've only been plugged in a week

285
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,898
and every day it's,
Climb the building, then fight bugs.

286
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,359
Climb the building, fight more bugs!

287
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,694
Yeah, yeah. Right. Look.

288
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,779
Easy on the overalls, spaceman.

289
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,156
It's tough all over, all right?

290
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,075
And all for what? A lousy medal?

291
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,870
Medal? You win a medal?

292
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,746
Yeah, Medal of Heroes.

293
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,748
Ooh. Is it shiny?

294
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,500
Pretty shiny.

295
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,628
Ooh! And it says hero on it?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

296
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,047
And you say you win it
by climbing a building?

297
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,799
And fighting bugs!
Right, bugs.

298
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,427
Is there any chance I could go
with you to your game

299
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,679
and maybe get one of those medals?

300
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,598
Negatory.
Does that mean maybe?

301
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,892
No! Look, only the bravest

302
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,895
and the best serve in our corps.

303
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,021
Bug!

304
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,611
Huh.

305
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:31,033
We are humanity's last hope.

306
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,581
Attention!

307
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,292
The arcade will open in five minutes.

308
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,294
Please report to your games.

309
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:47,007
I can't feel my legs.
What is all this stuff?

310
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,552
Smells like Ralph in here.

311
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,640
Okay. All right.
What was it called again?

312
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,600
Hero's something.

313
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,976
Duty. Hero's Duty.

314
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,269
Oh, there it is.

315
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,729
Oh!

316
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,401
Sorry, Q*bert. It's me, Ralph.

317
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:07,986
Shh!

318
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:13,700
The wall.

319
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,877
Morning, kids. Come on in.

320
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,338
Good to see you.
Good to see you. You, too, little fella.

321
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,845
Quarter alert! Quarter alert!

322
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:34,930
This is not a drill.

323
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,766
Ooh! Sweet golden medal!

324
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,315
On a planet with no name

325
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,485
a top-secret experiment
has gone horribly wrong.

326
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,614
You are humanity's last hope.

327
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,119
Rooting-tooting, ready for shooting!

328
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,620
All right.

329
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,623
Now listen up, because
I'm only going to say this once.

330
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,293
Fear is a four-letter word, ladies.

331
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,920
If you want to go pee-pee
in your big-boy slacks,

332
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,297
keep it to yourself.

333
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,799
It's make your mamas proud time!

334
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,134
I love my mama!

335
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,885
Heads up!
First-person shooter,

336
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,053
coming through!

337
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,638
Ooh, robot!

338
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,848
Boop, boop, boop.

339
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,060
Game play in three, two, one.

340
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,064
We are humanity's last hope.

341
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,149
Our mission?

342
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,068
Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

343
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,404
You ready, rookie? Let's find out.

344
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,533
Sweet Mother Hubbard!

345
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,123
No, no, no! Wait a second! Aah!

346
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,671
Cy-Bug, twelve o'clock. Take it, newbie.

347
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,760
No, no! Wait, wait!

348
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,307
Watch it, rookie! These monsters
become what they eat.

349
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,519
My gun! Give me that back.

350
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,443
Shoot the eggs before they hatch!

351
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,569
Oh, no!

352
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,196
Something's coming out of their bottom!

353
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,200
Oh, gross!
Markowski!

354
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,868
Get back in formation!

355
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,828
All right, ladies,

356
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,456
the kitten whispers
and tickle fights stop now.

357
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,291
The entrance to the lab
is straight ahead.

358
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,168
I'll meet you guys inside!
No!

359
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,420
Oh! Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

360
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,217
I thought this was going
to be like Centipede!

361
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,428
When did video games
become so violent and scary?

362
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,806
Please, get me out of here!

363
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,517
Take her!

364
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,855
What a rip-off!

365
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,984
Ah! Get off me! It's game over. Stop it!

366
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,698
Beacon up!

367
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,662
Cease fire! Cease fire!

368
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,170
Attention!
Return to start positions.

369
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,005
Return to start positions.

370
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,385
Here, let me help you. Sorry about that.

371
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,345
Yeah, you must be upset.

372
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,264
Markowski.
Who?

373
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,934
Whoa! Oh, yeah, me. I'm Markowski. Ah!

374
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,978
What's the first rule of Hero's Duty?

375
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,605
No cuts, no butts, no coconuts?

376
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,735
Never interfere with
the first-person shooter.

377
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,654
Our job is to get the gamers
to the top of that building

378
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,323
so they can get a medal, and that's it!

379
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,451
So stick to the program, soldier!

380
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,535
Right. Right. Aye, aye.

381
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,245
Quarter alert!
Quarter alert!

382
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,081
All right, pussy willows.
Back to start positions!

383
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,374
Oh!

384
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,503
Yeah, right.
No way I'm going through that again.

385
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,507
So that's where they
keep the medal, huh?

386
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,347
Hmm. New racers daily.

387
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,558
Sweet! I got next game.

388
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,684
Go away, kid!

389
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,352
We're going to play
all nine of today's racers!

390
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,437
Yeah!

391
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,773
Sorry.

392
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,538
Hmm. Where's the wrecking guy?

393
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,459
Where's Ralph? He should be
wrecking the building.

394
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,628
Shh! Stick with the program.

395
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,880
Fix it, Felix!

396
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,225
Ralph!
Quarter alert! Game on!

397
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,317
Do something, Felix!

398
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,028
Just act natural. I'll fix it.

399
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,909
Ralph! Ralph!

400
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,202
What the...

401
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,454
Ralph? Ralph!

402
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,584
Oh, my land! Where is he?

403
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,003
Mr. Litwak!

404
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,630
What's the trouble, sweetheart?

405
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,090
The game's busted.

406
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,760
I can fix it! I can fix it!

407
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:24,886
Oh, boy.

408
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,973
Looks like the game's
gone cuckoo, like my nana.

409
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,809
Sorry, sweetie.
Here's your quarter back.

410
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,227
But what about the game?

411
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,229
I'll have someone look at it tomorrow...

412
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,439
But if he can't fix it, it might be time

413
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,692
to put old Ralph and Felix
out to pasture.

414
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,026
Like my nana.

415
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,207
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're out of order.

416
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,085
Sweet mercy!
Without Ralph, we're doomed!

417
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,087
They're going to pull our plug!

418
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,009
Okay, everybody, calm down.

419
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,094
Ralph probably fell asleep

420
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,721
in the washroom of Tapper's again.

421
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,307
See? There he is now.

422
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,857
Why, it's Q*bert.
What brings you here, neighbor?

423
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,193
What's he saying, Felix?

424
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,113
Stand by. My Q*bert-ese is a little rusty.

425
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,005
Ralph's gone Turbo!

426
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,353
Ooh!

427
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,605
Shiny.

428
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,400
Attention!
The arcade is now closed.

429
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,902
Did you get a load of Markowski?

430
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,987
Shut your chew holes.

431
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:07,906
Cy-Bug.

432
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,250
Taste it!

433
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,343
Slick Tiddlywinking, pint-size.

434
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,011
I'm Fix-It Felix, Jr., ma'am.

435
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,639
From the game Fix-It Felix, Jr.

436
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,059
Jiminey jaminey!

437
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,730
Look at that high definition. Your face!

438
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,233
It's amazing!

439
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,820
Flattery don't charge
these batteries, civilian.

440
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,238
Now, state your business.

441
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,241
I'm looking for my colleague,
Wreck-it Ralph?

442
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,034
Never heard of him.

443
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,412
Well, Q*bert saw him come in here.

444
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:59,040
Impossible. Nothing gets past me.

445
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,210
That came from the tower.

446
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,273
Nice eggs. Nice eggs!

447
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,067
Okay. That was easy.

448
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,949
Congratulations, soldier.

449
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,243
It is my honor to bestow upon you

450
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,412
the Medal of Heroes.

451
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,165
Wow!

452
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:55,638
No way!

453
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:56,806
Ten-hut!

454
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:59,517
Wow!

455
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,856
History will long revere
your courage and sacrifice.

456
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,066
Well, thank you!

457
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,984
You have etched in the rock of virtue

458
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,903
a legacy beyond compare.

459
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,530
Thanks, guys. At ease!

460
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,575
You are the universe's greatest hero.

461
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,785
Oops!

462
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,165
The living embodiment of
all this corps represents.

463
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:23,666
Oh.

464
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:27,796
Bravery. Integrity.
Grace under pressure.

465
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,590
And above all, dignity.

466
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,717
Escape pod activated.

467
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,305
Get off my face!

468
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,521
Incoming!

469
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:51,528
Ralph!
Cy-Bug!

470
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,166
A-ha!

471
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,251
Oh, no!

472
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,446
Huh?

473
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,750
Sayonara, sucker!

474
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:52,797
Huh?

475
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,346
Sugar Rush?

476
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,605
Oh, no!

477
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,441
This is that candy go-cart game

478
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,026
over by the Whac-A-Mole.

479
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:14,736
I got to get out of here.

480
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,779
Oh, no! My medal!

481
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,535
No, no, no, no, my medal!

482
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,204
Oh!

483
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,916
No, no, my medal!

484
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,396
Hi, mister.

485
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,399
Hello.

486
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,113
Man, you scared me, kid.
Ah, I nearly soiled myself.

487
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,823
What's your name?

488
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,575
Uh... Ralph. Wreck-It Ralph.

489
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,494
You're not from here, are you?

490
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:07,997
No, well, yeah. I mean,
not from right in this area.

491
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,374
I'm just doing some work here.

492
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,541
What kind of work?

493
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,710
Some routine candy tree trimming.

494
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,170
You probably want to stand back.

495
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,172
In fact, this whole area

496
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,632
is technically closed
while we're trimming.

497
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,676
Who's we?
Candy tree department.

498
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,594
Oh! Where is everybody else?

499
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,096
Ah, it's just me today.

500
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,556
So you just meant like the royal we?

501
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,684
Yep. That's right.

502
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,560
Hey, are you a hobo?

503
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,773
No. I'm not a hobo, but I am busy.

504
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,192
Okay? So you go home.

505
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,069
What's that? Didn't hear you.

506
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,363
Your breath is so bad
it made my ears numb.

507
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,614
Listen, I tried to be nice.

508
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,074
I tried to be nice.

509
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,702
You're mimicking me.
You're mimicking me!

510
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,662
Okay.
Okay.

511
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,248
That is rude,
and this conversation is over.

512
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,083
And this conversation is over.

513
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:56,045
Uh, I wouldn't grab that branch
if I were you.

514
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,922
I'm from the candy tree department,
so I know what...

515
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,507
It's a double stripe.

516
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:04,721
Double stripes break. Guh-doy!

517
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,307
Why are your hands so freakishly big?

518
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,268
Uh, I don't know. Why are you
so freakishly annoying?

519
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,895
Why are you so freakishly...

520
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,398
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
A gold coin!

521
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,066
Don't even think about it. That is mine.

522
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,568
Race you for it!
Hey!

523
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,362
I don't have to race for it
because it's mine!

524
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,448
Double stripe!
Come back here!

525
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,700
The winner!
Give it back! Give it!

526
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:26,826
Whoa!

527
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:30,788
Double stripe.

528
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,710
Thank you!

529
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:39,172
Wait! Let me talk to you for one second.

530
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,424
Okay. Here's the thing.

531
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,051
I'm not from the candy tree department.

532
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:46,929
Lying to a child. Shame on you, Ralph.

533
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,016
But I wasn't lying about the medal.
That is my medal!

534
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,477
That's why I was climbing the tree.
It's mine!

535
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,062
It's precious to me.

536
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:57,023
That thing is my ticket to a better life.

537
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,317
Yeah, well, now it's my ticket.

538
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,319
What the...
See you, chump!

539
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,030
Come back! I'll find you!

540
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,865
I will find you!

541
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,991
Double stripe!

542
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,869
Nowhere to hide!

543
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:15,541
Yeah, he banged around in here
like some kind of hot shot,

544
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,169
then he went barreling down
into that sweet little game

545
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:19,962
like a crazy person.

546
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,672
Sugar Rush.

547
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,758
Cy-Bugs would chew up that game

548
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:27,512
faster than a chicken hawk
in a coop of crippled roosters.

549
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,764
What was that, now?
What are you, thick?

550
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,974
There was a Cy-Bug on that shuttle!

551
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,103
Do you even know what a Cy-Bug is?

552
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,063
I can't say that I do, ma'am.

553
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,148
Cy-Bugs are like a virus.

554
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,733
They don't know they're in a game.

555
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,820
All they know is eat, kill, multiply.

556
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,655
Without a beacon to stop them,

557
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,657
they'll consume Sugar Rush.

558
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:48,991
But do you think they'll stop there?

559
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,576
Yes!
Wrong!

560
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,538
Viruses do not stop!

561
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,249
Once those Cy-Bugs
finish off Sugar Rush,

562
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,419
they'll invade every other game
until this arcade

563
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:04,340
is nothing but a smoking husk
of forgotten dreams.

564
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,135
Kohut! My cruiser.

565
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:13,099
Jeepers. Is she always this intense?

566
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,892
It's not her fault.

567
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:18,062
She's programmed with
the most tragic back-story ever.

568
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:20,481
The one day she didn't do
a perimeter check...

569
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,776
Her wedding day.

570
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,502
Wait, ma'am! I'm going with you.

571
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,504
Like fun you are, short stack.

572
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:46,090
If you die outside your game,
you don't regenerate.

573
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,843
Well, neither do you, ma'am.

574
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:51,888
And it is my job to fix
what Ralph wrecks.

575
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,723
And I cannot ask you

576
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:55,850
to risk your life cleaning up his mess.

577
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:59,979
No flex on this one, ma'am.
I am coming along with you.

578
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,770
Citizens of Sugar Rush...

579
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:42,647
Just in time.

580
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:48,277
...all hail our rightful ruler, King Candy.

581
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,656
Hello, my royal subjects!

582
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,116
Ha-ha! Have some candy!

583
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,872
Thank you for that
stirring introduction, Sour Bill.

584
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:00,998
Mmm-hmm.

585
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,876
And thank you to today's avatars.

586
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,921
It was a wonderful day of racing. It was.

587
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,714
But now the arcade is closed,

588
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,050
so it's time to wipe the slate clean

589
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,636
and race to decide our new roster.

590
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,139
The first nine racers
across that finish line

591
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,895
will represent Sugar Rush
as tomorrow's avatars!

592
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,355
Race! Race! Race!

593
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,816
Okay, calm down.

594
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:30,820
Listen! This event is pay-to-play.
We all know this.

595
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,489
The fee to compete is one gold coin

596
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,616
from your previous winnings,

597
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:38,452
if you've ever won, which I have.

598
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,371
Let me go first!

599
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,461
King Candy!

600
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:56,846
Taffyta Muttonfudge!

601
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,014
Stay sweet!

602
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,684
Adorabeezle Winterpop.

603
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,270
Gloyd Orangeboar!

604
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:10,026
Little stealer!
Wait till I catch that brat.

605
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,362
Minty Zaki.
Snowanna Rainbeau.

606
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:17,283
Rancis Fluggerbutter.
Jubileena Bing-Bing.

607
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,077
Swizzle Malarkey.

608
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,580
Candlehead.

609
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,423
Sour Bill, who's that last one?

610
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,179
Vanellope von Schweetz!

611
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:40,431
Yippee! I'm in the race!

612
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,599
Vanellope?

613
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,477
The Glitch!

614
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,272
Now, now!

615
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:51,859
Everything is all right! Security!

616
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,194
Come here, kid!

617
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,571
We're not going to hurt you,
you little freak!

618
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,158
Get back here!

619
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,451
Slow down! Slow down a little bit.

620
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:08,376
You! Give me back my medal right now!

621
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,960
Ah, boy!
Go!

622
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,545
What is that?

623
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:13,464
Come on! Go! Roll!

624
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,229
Careful! What are you doing?

625
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:34,735
Huh?

626
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,156
Come back here!

627
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:42,868
I can't move!

628
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,495
Now we got him!

629
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,248
Oh, good, the cops. She went that way!

630
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:48,874
Hold still!
Take that!

631
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,000
Ow! What are you doing?

632
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:51,544
Okay, folks.

633
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:54,505
Calm down! Everything's all right.

634
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:56,716
The monster's been caught!

635
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,801
We'll repair all the damage.

636
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,638
Don't worry. We will have our race
before the arcade opens.

637
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:06,434
And I'm in it. Yes!

638
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:13,733
There's no way that
I am racing with a glitch.

639
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:15,651
Rancis, Candlehead, come on.

640
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:20,448
Sour Bill, that glitch
cannot be allowed to race!

641
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:22,742
And bring that thing to my castle.

642
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,577
Guys! She took...

643
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:33,377
Or-e-oh
Oreo!

644
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,504
Or-e-oh

645
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:49,810
Sour Bill, de-taffify this monster

646
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,645
so we can see
what we're up against here.

647
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:52,897
Mm-kay.

648
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,818
Milk my duds! It's Wreck-It Ralph?

649
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,905
Yeah. Who are you,
the guy that makes the donuts?

650
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,033
Please. No. I'm King Candy!

651
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,535
I see you're a fan of pink.

652
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,871
Salmon. Salmon, that's obviously...

653
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:10,581
What are you doing here?

654
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:14,877
Look, Your Candiness,
this is just a big misunderstanding.

655
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,587
Just get me out of this cupcake,

656
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,714
I'll get my medal,
and I'll be out of your way.

657
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:22,593
Your medal?
Bad guys don't win medals.

658
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,220
Well, this one did.

659
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,222
I earned it over in Hero's Duty.

660
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:27,389
You game-jumped?

661
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:30,059
Ralph, you're not going Turbo, are you?

662
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,519
What? No, no.

663
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:35,147
Because if you think you can
come in here to my kingdom

664
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:37,691
and take over my game,
you've got another thing coming!

665
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,485
Easy, Your Puffiness.

666
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,237
It's not my fault one of your children

667
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,113
of the candy corn stole my medal.

668
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,449
Children of the candy corn? Who'd...

669
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,201
The Glitch!

670
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,703
The coin she used to
buy her way into the race.

671
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:50,788
That was your medal?

672
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,123
She did what? I need that back!

673
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,043
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you.
It's gone, you know.

674
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:58,546
It's nothing but code now.

675
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:01,715
It will stay that way
until someone wins the cup

676
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,092
at the end of the race.

677
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,469
Maybe I'll have to have a little talk

678
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,720
with the winner then.

679
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,639
Is that a threat I smell?

680
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,352
Beyond the halitosis
you so obviously suffer from.

681
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,939
Listen, Nilly-Wafer,
I'm not leaving without my medal!

682
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:18,482
Yes, you are.

683
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,485
Wynnchel, Duncan,
get him out of that cupcake

684
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,362
and on the first train back home.

685
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,781
If I ever see you here again,
Wreck-It Ralph,

686
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,492
I'll lock you in my fungeon.

687
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:29,702
Fungeon?

688
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:32,538
Fun dungeon, you know?
It's a play on words.

689
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:34,248
It's the...

690
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:38,752
Never mind! I've got a glitch
to deal with, thanks to you.

691
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:42,631
Goodbye, Wreck-it Ralph!
It hasn't been a pleasure.

692
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,304
This thing is hard as a rock.

693
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,430
I can see that.

694
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,931
Get the tools.
What tools?

695
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,474
Quiet, you!
Ow!

696
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,561
What? No!

697
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,354
Take it easy, big boy!
Stay away from me!

698
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,522
He's getting away!

699
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,988
Quick! Call out the Devil Dogs.

700
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,214
Chocolate. I hate chocolate!

701
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,010
I got to get my medal back.

702
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,683
The pot goes to the winning racer!

703
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,852
Hey, kids!
Can I talk to you for a second?

704
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,365
Hello, fellow racers!

705
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:52,409
It's that little crumb snatcher.

706
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,204
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis,
you're looking well.

707
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,873
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

708
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,876
Well, here it is, the Lickety-Split!

709
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,045
Sheesh. Looks like she built it herself.

710
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,380
I built it myself.

711
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,091
Fastest pedal-power
west of the Whac-A-Mole.

712
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:08,342
Check her out.

713
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,059
Oh, Vanellope, it's so... You.

714
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:21,105
But you have to
back out of the race. Yeah.

715
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,856
Oh, no, I don't,

716
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,693
because I paid my fee
and I'm on the board...

717
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,945
So, yeah, I'm definitely racing.

718
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:30,948
Yeah, well, King Candy says
glitches can't race.

719
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:34,535
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?

720
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:36,578
The rules are there
for a reason, Vanellope.

721
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:39,540
To protect us. Say I'm you.

722
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:42,376
I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving

723
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,045
and I actually feel kind of cool for once.

724
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,131
And then, all of a sudden, oh, no.

725
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,717
I'm glitching!

726
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:51,176
Hey!
See?

727
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,303
You're an accident
just waiting to happen.

728
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:56,390
Oh, no! I glitched, too!

729
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,767
Uncool.

730
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,603
Stop it! Stop! You're breaking it!

731
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:04,148
Please!

732
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,567
I just want to race like you guys.

733
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:10,112
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch.

734
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:12,281
And that's all you'll ever be!

735
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,951
Hey! Leave her alone!

736
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,623
Let's get out of here!

737
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,338
Scram, you rotten little cavities!

738
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:29,965
Before I throw you in the mud!

739
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,182
What are you looking at?

740
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,769
You're welcome, you rotten little thief.

741
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:45,147
I'm not a thief!
I just borrowed your stupid coin.

742
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,941
I was going to give it back to you
as soon as I won the race.

743
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:50,319
It's not a coin. It is a medal.

744
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:52,362
Coin, medal, whatever.

745
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:55,157
Just go back to your own dumb game
and win another one.

746
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,576
I can't. I didn't win it in my game.

747
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,328
I won it in Hero's Duty.

748
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:01,497
Hero's Doodie?

749
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,542
It's not that kind of duty.

750
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:07,711
I bet you really got to watch
where you step

751
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,047
in a game called Hero's Doodie!

752
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:13,717
What did you win the medal for, wiping?

753
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:18,347
I hope you washed your hands
after you handled that medal.

754
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,848
Listen!
One more, one more.

755
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,351
Why did the hero flush the toilet?

756
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:25,521
Say why.
Why?

757
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,689
Because it was his doodie!

758
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,608
How dare you insult Hero's Duty?

759
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,859
You little guttersnipe!

760
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:32,402
I earned that medal

761
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:34,863
and you better get it back
for me toot-sweet, sister!

762
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,824
Well, unless you've got a go-cart

763
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:38,659
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

764
00:43:38,826 --> 00:43:40,160
I can't help you!

765
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,252
What a moron.

766
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:51,213
Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker.

767
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:52,714
You're never going to break...

768
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,176
Huh.

769
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,390
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby?

770
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:02,724
Leave me alone.

771
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:07,062
Look, you want that medal,
right? And I want to race.

772
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,897
So here's what I'm thinking.

773
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:12,276
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

774
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:15,404
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

775
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:18,115
You want me to help you?

776
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,576
All you got to do is
break something for me.

777
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,412
Come on. What do you say, friend?

778
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,122
We are not friends.

779
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,293
Oh, come on, pal. You son of a gun.

780
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:31,795
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

781
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,298
Ah. Come on, chumbo.

782
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:36,884
Ralph, my man. My main man.

783
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:38,552
Hey!

784
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,972
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

785
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,559
You better win.

786
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:50,063
Well, I'll say this much,

787
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,608
they don't call your friend
Wreck-It for nothing.

788
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,360
There's the shuttle.

789
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,073
Is he in there?

790
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:03,118
Nope. Lucky for him.

791
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:05,787
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

792
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,457
No Cy-Bug, either.

793
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:12,252
Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.

794
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:14,838
It came this way,

795
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,632
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

796
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,133
are jamming my sensor.

797
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,635
Can't get a read on it.

798
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:22,095
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

799
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:23,305
Why did he go AWOL?

800
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,932
I wish I knew, ma'am.

801
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,809
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

802
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,479
Going on about cake and medals...

803
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,523
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

804
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:34,858
Go Turbo?

805
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:37,778
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in.

806
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:41,323
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

807
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:44,284
Turbo Time was by far
the most popular game.

808
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,787
And Turbo...
Turbo-tastic!

809
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:49,498
He loved the attention.
Turbo-tastic!

810
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:52,542
So, when RoadBlasters got plugged in

811
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:54,127
and stole Turbo's thunder...

812
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,671
New game. All right!

813
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,673
Boy, was he jealous.

814
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,177
So jealous that
he abandoned his game

815
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:03,845
and tried to take over the new one.

816
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,139
These are
the greatest graphics I've ever seen!

817
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:07,349
Turbo-tastic!

818
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,186
Hey. Is that...
That looks like Turbo.

819
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:14,314
What's Turbo doing
in this game? Aw, come on!

820
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:15,899
Mr. Litwak!

821
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:20,654
Turbo ended up
putting both games and himself

822
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:24,032
out of order, for good.

823
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:27,244
Yes, the selfish man
is like a mangy dog

824
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,246
chasing a cautionary tale.

825
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:30,747
I know, right?

826
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:33,500
That's why I have to get Ralph home

827
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:35,711
or the same thing's
gonna happen to my game.

828
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,087
Huh?

829
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:41,842
What is this?

830
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:45,304
Nesquik Sand?
Quicksand?

831
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:48,223
Oh, I'll hop out
and grab you one of those vines.

832
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,183
Huh!

833
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:57,107
I can't hop. I'm hop-less.
This is hopeless!

834
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,400
We're going to drown here.

835
00:46:58,442 --> 00:46:59,943
Stop thrashing. Stop moving.

836
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:01,111
You're making us sink faster.

837
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,237
We're going to die!

838
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:03,780
Get ahold of yourself!

839
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:10,704
The vines. They're Laffy Taffy.

840
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:13,206
They're attracted to
whatever makes them laugh.

841
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,750
Here, hit me again.

842
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:21,089
That's not funny enough. Harder!

843
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:22,799
Look, you're a nice guy. I can't...

844
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:25,594
No, ma'am!
The arcade is depending on us.

845
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,430
Now do your duty. That's an ord...

846
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:30,515
Oh!

847
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,934
It's working! Hit me again.

848
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:34,895
Ooh, your eye.

849
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:37,939
I can fix it. Now...

850
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,943
Oh! San Fran-tastic! Again!

851
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,279
Ow! You mean business!

852
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:47,282
Ow! Yikes on bikes!

853
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:52,079
Wow! We're... killing... them!

854
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,456
Comedy gold!

855
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,317
All right, enough with the goo-goo eyes.

856
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,069
We've got work to do. Let's go.

857
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:28,490
Ugh. We lost the Cy-Bug.

858
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,450
Come on. We'll get
a better view from the air.

859
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,160
You think you can fix that shuttle?

860
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:34,287
Can do.

861
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,097
Shh!

862
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,440
All right, do your thing, knuckles.
Bust it open!

863
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,443
What's this?
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?

864
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,361
Hey, we shook on it.

865
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,825
Thank you, Jeeves.

866
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,037
What is this place?
Where are the carts?

867
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,330
You gotta make one.

868
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:18,540
What? No, no.

869
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,542
Look, kid, bad idea. Trust me.

870
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,711
I don't make things. I break things.

871
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:24,880
Well, it looks like
you're going to be stepping outside

872
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,381
your comfort zone, then, Gladys.

873
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:28,175
Ooh, this is a good one!

874
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:32,304
Welcome to the bakery!
Let's bake a kart!

875
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:33,972
What is this, another game?

876
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,307
Yeah, well,
it's a mini-game.

877
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,017
You have one minute to win it.

878
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,477
What?
Come on, Ralph!

879
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:40,395
Go! Mixing.

880
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,147
Put the ingredients in the bowl

881
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,690
and throw away the trash.

882
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:45,025
Hairbrush. No!

883
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,152
Underpants. No, no!

884
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:48,737
You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid.

885
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,530
I'm trying!

886
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:53,909
Let me up there. I'll do it. No. Yes.

887
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,745
Gross. Milk. Yes, yes, yes. Oh!

888
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,039
Batter up!

889
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,081
Ah!

890
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:06,588
Come on!
No sleeping on the job!

891
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:09,508
Baking! Pump up the heat

892
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:11,551
and hold the perfect temperature.

893
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:13,220
Ralph, a little help here?

894
00:50:13,345 --> 00:50:14,346
I'm on it.

895
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:19,267
Yeah, no problem.
Give me this thing here.

896
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:22,354
Okay, good. Little more.

897
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:25,607
Yeah, that's it! Hold it, hold it, hold it.

898
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,946
Yes! Come on. Get up, Ralph!
Fifteen seconds!

899
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:32,697
Decorating!
Wheels first.

900
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,115
How many?
Four, doy!

901
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,283
Got it.

902
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,870
Now frosting. A buttload of frosting!

903
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:39,955
No problem.

904
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:47,462
Oh.

905
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:55,303
Time's up!
Congratulations.

906
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,348
You did it, and here's your cart!

907
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,571
Look, kid... I tried to warn you.

908
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,657
I can't make things. I just break...

909
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,242
I love it.

910
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:18,827
You do?

911
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,495
I love it.

912
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:22,664
I love it! I love it! I love it!

913
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:24,499
Look, it's got a real engine!

914
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:26,001
And look at these wheels.

915
00:51:27,586 --> 00:51:30,672
I love it! I finally have a real cart!

916
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:35,343
Come on. A work of art
like this must be signed.

917
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:38,972
Cream puffs.

918
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,017
Hmm?

919
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:48,023
This is Beard Papa.

920
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:50,859
The Glitch is in the bakery!
Get me King Candy!

921
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:58,116
Oh, what? You have teeth?

922
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,535
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile before.

923
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:04,497
I'm not smiling. I was... I'm gassy, okay?

924
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,544
Hold it right there, Glitch!

925
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:11,713
And Wreck-It Ralph?
Uh-oh.

926
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,842
Start the cart! Start the cart!

927
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:18,178
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Let's go!

928
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:22,766
I don't know how to drive a real cart.

929
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:24,225
You don't what?

930
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:25,727
Are you hurt, Sire?

931
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:29,064
No, he just glazed me. Get them!

932
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:30,940
Gangway!
Oh!

933
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:34,736
Ah!

934
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:38,031
Stop, in the name of the king!
That's me!

935
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,079
Get off the road!

936
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,294
Head for Diet Cola Mountain!

937
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,008
Drive into the wall!
What?

938
00:52:57,092 --> 00:52:59,844
Right there, between
the two sugar-free lollipops!

939
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:02,097
Are you crazy?
Just do it!

940
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:10,438
Oh!

941
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:17,529
Where did they go?
They should have just turned.

942
00:53:19,114 --> 00:53:22,242
Find that glitch! Destroy that cart!

943
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:24,703
She can't be allowed to race!

944
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:33,378
So let me get this straight.
You don't know how to drive.

945
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:35,255
Well, no, not technically.

946
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:37,090
I just thought that...
What did you think?

947
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:40,260
Oh, I'll just magically win the race

948
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:41,803
just because I really want to!

949
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,264
Look, wise guy. I know I'm a racer.

950
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:46,307
I can feel it in my code.

951
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,895
That's it! I'm never
getting my medal back.

952
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:54,566
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal anyway?

953
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:55,692
The big whoop?

954
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:58,153
Well, this may come as
a shock to you, but in my game,

955
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,572
I'm the bad guy
and I live in the garbage.

956
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,699
Cool.
No. Not cool.

957
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,618
Unhygienic and lonely and boring.

958
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:10,039
And that crummy medal
was going to change all that.

959
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,083
I go home with that baby
around my neck

960
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:14,169
and I'll get a penthouse. Pies.

961
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:16,796
Ice sculptures. Fireworks!

962
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:21,009
It's grown-up stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

963
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:22,677
No, I get it!

964
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:25,013
That's exactly
what racing would do for me!

965
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:26,514
Well, guess what?
What?

966
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:29,642
News flash! Neither one of us
is getting what we want!

967
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,272
What was that?

968
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,499
Yeah! Check it out. Look!

969
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:58,046
Oh!

970
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,548
Ow! Whoa!

971
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:02,342
You got to watch out for the splash.

972
00:55:02,425 --> 00:55:04,177
That stuff is broiling hot.

973
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,804
Yeah, I got that. Thank you.

974
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,223
What is this dump?

975
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:12,018
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level.

976
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,062
Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

977
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:17,649
I found that secret opening,
and now I live here.

978
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:19,442
See? Oh, look, look, look.

979
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,445
Welcome to my home!

980
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:25,031
I sleep in these candy wrappers.

981
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:28,117
I bundle myself up like
a little homeless lady.

982
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:30,620
By yourself?

983
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,581
With all this garbage around you?

984
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:36,626
Well, yeah.

985
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:38,878
I mean, everyone here
says I'm just a mistake

986
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:41,005
and that I wasn't
even supposed to exist.

987
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,674
What do you expect?

988
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,218
Listen, kid...

989
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:47,637
I know it's none of my business

990
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:50,431
but why do you even
stick around this game?

991
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:52,684
You really don't know anything, do you?

992
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:55,061
Glitches can't leave their games.

993
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:59,858
It's one of the joys of being me.

994
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:10,243
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

995
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:13,413
I know it's a dump, but it's all I got.

996
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:14,873
If you're going to be a racer,

997
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:16,332
you're going to have
to learn how to drive.

998
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:19,502
And you can't do that without a track.

999
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,216
Whoa!

1000
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,801
All right, now.

1001
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:28,553
Let's hustle up.
We've got some driving to do.

1002
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:31,180
I'm going to learn to drive!
I'm going to learn to drive!

1003
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:32,599
Oh, wait. Do you know how to drive?

1004
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,767
Yeah! I mean, I haven't done it, but...

1005
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:36,477
Look, I flew a spaceship today, okay?

1006
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:37,604
You crashed it.

1007
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:40,315
Just get in. How hard can it be?
Okay, uh...

1008
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:42,150
Start it up.

1009
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:48,031
There we go. So there are
some buttons on the floor.

1010
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:49,949
Pedals.
Pedals. Right.

1011
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:54,704
Now, uh, that's the go pedal.

1012
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:58,833
That I believe is the stopper.

1013
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,836
And this... Wait.

1014
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,422
What is this? That doesn't do anything.

1015
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,132
Ooh, what does this joystick do?

1016
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,844
Okay, good. Let's try that again.

1017
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,347
I've been looking
for a driver who's qualified

1018
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:14,223
So if you think that you're the one

1019
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:15,350
Ow!

1020
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:16,684
To step into my ride

1021
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,478
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic
speed machine

1022
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:19,604
Ow!

1023
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,731
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean

1024
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:22,857
Ow!

1025
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:27,487
So if you feel me
let me know, know, know

1026
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:28,613
Ow!

1027
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:31,449
So start me up
and watch me go, go, go, go

1028
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,077
Get you where you wanna go
If you know what I mean

1029
00:57:34,911 --> 00:57:37,872
Got a ride that's smoother
than a limousine

1030
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:40,083
'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five

1031
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,209
Now shift it.

1032
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:43,378
Baby you got the keys

1033
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,338
That's good. Keep going! Shift it again!

1034
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,675
Now shut up and drive
Drive, drive, drive

1035
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:53,680
I told you, racing's in my code!

1036
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,390
So if you feel me
let me know, know, know

1037
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:58,226
I got that medal in the bag!

1038
00:57:58,351 --> 00:58:00,478
Hey, Ralphie, watch this!

1039
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:03,147
Get you where you wanna go
if you know what I mean

1040
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:05,900
Got a ride that's smoother
than a limousine

1041
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:07,527
Whoo-hoo!

1042
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:10,488
Cause I'm zero to 60 in three point five

1043
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:14,117
Baby you got the keys

1044
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:15,994
Look out!
Whoa!

1045
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,332
Shut up and drive

1046
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:22,417
Ah!

1047
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:27,422
Hot cola!

1048
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,719
Now shut up and drive

1049
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:33,928
So how did I do?

1050
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:35,138
Um...

1051
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,515
Well, you almost blew up
the whole mountain.

1052
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,268
Right, right. That's a good note.

1053
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:42,520
You got to get that
glitch under control, kid.

1054
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:44,063
Okay, I will, I will.

1055
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:46,983
And then you think I got a chance?

1056
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:49,444
Um...

1057
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:50,862
Tiny.

1058
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:52,697
Yes, I'm going to win!

1059
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,741
I'm going to win! I'm going to win!

1060
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:56,701
Top shelf.
Top shelf.

1061
00:59:09,005 --> 00:59:11,257
Did you find her?
Tell me you found her.

1062
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,260
You didn't?

1063
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:18,806
Go. Leave me.

1064
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,662
Up, up, down, down...

1065
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:45,500
Start!

1066
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:52,507
Oh, the code. It's the sweet
lifeblood of the game.

1067
00:59:58,638 --> 01:00:03,184
Where are you? Let's see...
Stadium, no. Jumbotron.

1068
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:07,146
Ha-ha! There it is. The winner's cup.

1069
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:12,610
One of these things is
not like the others... It's you!

1070
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:15,530
We're going to give you
a nice new home.

1071
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:28,584
Success!

1072
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,338
Sour Bill, I'm going out.

1073
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:34,841
You're in charge of the castle
until I get back.

1074
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:47,854
Your face is still red.

1075
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:49,856
You might want to
hit it again with your hammer.

1076
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:52,567
Oh, that's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.

1077
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:55,444
That's just the honey glow
in my cheeks.

1078
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,280
Okay.

1079
01:00:57,697 --> 01:01:00,700
Ma'am, I just got to tell you...

1080
01:01:00,867 --> 01:01:03,411
You are one dynamite gal.

1081
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:09,458
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

1082
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,086
One dynamite gal.

1083
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,796
Dynamite gal.

1084
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:15,298
Dynamite gal.

1085
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:16,757
Dynamite...

1086
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:23,514
Get out.

1087
01:01:23,598 --> 01:01:25,474
All I said is you're a dynamite gal.

1088
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,101
I said get out!

1089
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:37,653
Oh. Jiminey jaminey.

1090
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,494
Yes?

1091
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:46,954
Oh.

1092
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:51,500
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr., sir,
from the game Fix-It Felix Jr.

1093
01:01:51,918 --> 01:01:53,252
Have you seen my friend Ralph?

1094
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:54,795
Wreck-It Ralph?

1095
01:01:55,046 --> 01:01:56,589
Yes. Yes, that's him!

1096
01:01:56,923 --> 01:01:59,759
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

1097
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:01,093
Locked him up?

1098
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:04,055
I'm not making
the same mistake with you.

1099
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:10,478
Hurry, hurry!
Let's go. Time's a-wastin'.

1100
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:11,687
Come on, Ralph!

1101
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:13,773
This is it. This is really happening.

1102
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:15,149
I almost don't believe it.

1103
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:18,152
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long, and now...

1104
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,404
And now... Now I think
I'm going to puke, actually.

1105
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:21,864
I mean, I think I might puke.

1106
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:23,532
You know, like a vurp.
A what?

1107
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:25,368
Vomit and a burp together,

1108
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,787
and you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1109
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,205
Oh, this is so exciting!

1110
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:31,123
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1111
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,292
Am I ready to be a real racer?

1112
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:35,503
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

1113
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:39,006
Who doesn't love a brat
with dirty hair? Come on.

1114
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:42,468
Those people are going
to love you. You know why?

1115
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,221
Because you're a winner.
I'm a winner.

1116
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:48,140
And you're adorable!
I'm adorable!

1117
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:49,850
And everyone loves
an adorable winner!

1118
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:51,394
Yeah!

1119
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:53,688
Okay, come on. Listen to me.

1120
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:56,816
If you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself,

1121
01:02:56,899 --> 01:03:01,070
I must win Ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined.

1122
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:03,531
And have fun. Got it?
Got it.

1123
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:05,032
Whoa!

1124
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:06,367
Oh, wait!

1125
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,036
Hold on!

1126
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,079
Where are you going?

1127
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,081
I forgot something! I'll be right back!

1128
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:15,668
Kids.

1129
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,339
Ralph!
There you are. Hello!

1130
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,676
You!
I come alone, unarmed.

1131
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:26,220
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

1132
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:28,222
Please. Calm down! Please, look. Don't!

1133
01:03:29,432 --> 01:03:31,100
I'm going to beat the filling out of you!

1134
01:03:31,726 --> 01:03:34,228
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1135
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,732
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's... Well played.

1136
01:03:38,441 --> 01:03:40,151
What do you want, Candy?

1137
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:41,736
Listen, I just want to talk to you.

1138
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,780
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

1139
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,868
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1140
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:50,911
My medal. How did you...

1141
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:54,749
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1142
01:03:56,417 --> 01:03:57,543
Whoa.

1143
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:00,671
All I ask is that you hear me out.

1144
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:02,214
About what?

1145
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:05,259
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1146
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:06,927
about being a king is?

1147
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,722
Doing what's right, no matter what.

1148
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:10,973
Get to the point.

1149
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:13,267
Point being, I need your help.

1150
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:17,980
Sad as it is, Vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1151
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,149
Why are you people so against her?

1152
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:23,444
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1153
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:25,279
If Vanellope wins that race

1154
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,449
she'll be added to the race roster.

1155
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:31,994
Then gamers can choose her
as their avatar.

1156
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,914
And when they see her glitching

1157
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:37,666
and twitching and just being herself,

1158
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:39,585
they'll think our game is broken.

1159
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:42,797
We'll be put out of order for good.

1160
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:46,634
All my subjects will be homeless.

1161
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:52,640
But there's one who cannot
escape because she's a glitch.

1162
01:04:52,765 --> 01:04:55,351
Help! Somebody, help! Help!

1163
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:57,937
And when
the game's plug is pulled...

1164
01:04:57,978 --> 01:04:59,313
No!

1165
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,733
...she'll die with it.

1166
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,945
You don't know that will happen.

1167
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:07,238
The gamers could love her.

1168
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,448
And if they don't?

1169
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,791
I know it's tough,

1170
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:22,044
but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1171
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:27,842
She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1172
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:31,345
So can I count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

1173
01:05:34,223 --> 01:05:35,266
Very good.

1174
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:38,853
I'll give you two some time alone.

1175
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:06,380
I'm back!

1176
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:08,757
Did you miss me?

1177
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:12,928
Yeah... Uh... Can we talk for a second?

1178
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:15,097
Wait. First, kneel down.

1179
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:17,516
What? No, we really...
Will you just do it?

1180
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:19,393
Okay.

1181
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:23,564
Now, close your eyes.
Vanellope...

1182
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:24,982
Shush! Close them!

1183
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:30,154
Okay. Open them up.

1184
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,951
To Stinkbrain. Gee, thanks.

1185
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:37,119
Turn it over.

1186
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,998
I made it for you.

1187
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,167
Just in case we don't win.

1188
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,628
Not that I think
there's even a remote chance

1189
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:46,754
we're not going to win.

1190
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:49,548
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1191
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:54,553
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

1192
01:06:55,346 --> 01:06:57,640
Ralph, come on. Move your molasses.

1193
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:58,849
Um...

1194
01:06:59,475 --> 01:07:01,644
I've been thinking.
That's dangerous.

1195
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:04,897
Who cares about
this stupid race anyway? Right?

1196
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:07,441
That's not very funny, Ralph.

1197
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,610
No, I'm serious, and it was really fun

1198
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:10,819
to build the car and everything...

1199
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:13,989
But maybe you shouldn't do it.

1200
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:16,617
Hello? Is Ralph in there?

1201
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,285
I'd like to speak to him, please.

1202
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,287
Look, what I'm saying is
you can't be a racer.

1203
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,622
What?

1204
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:24,333
Why would you...

1205
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:27,211
Wait a minute.

1206
01:07:27,795 --> 01:07:28,796
No!

1207
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:29,964
Where did you get this?

1208
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:33,050
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1209
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,635
I've been talking to King Candy.

1210
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,303
King Candy?
Yeah.

1211
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:37,638
You sold me out?

1212
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,515
No, I didn't... Listen.
You don't understand.

1213
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,892
No, I understand plenty. Traitor!

1214
01:07:42,268 --> 01:07:43,269
I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1215
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:44,687
You're a rat!

1216
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:48,232
And I don't need you, and
I can win the race on my own.

1217
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:50,067
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid!

1218
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:51,902
Put me down! Let me go!

1219
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:53,153
No, you listen to me.

1220
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,238
Do you know what's going to happen

1221
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:55,322
when the players see you glitching?

1222
01:07:55,406 --> 01:07:56,657
They'll think the game's broken.

1223
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,158
I don't care! You're a liar!

1224
01:07:58,325 --> 01:08:00,744
You better care, because
if your game goes out of order,

1225
01:08:00,828 --> 01:08:01,829
you go down with the ship, little sister!

1226
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:02,997
I'm not listening to you!

1227
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:05,833
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!

1228
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,251
No, you're not!

1229
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,880
Take me down from here, Ralph,
right now!

1230
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:14,216
No. I'm doing this for your own good!

1231
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:17,720
Wait, wait, wait.

1232
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:19,597
No. No.

1233
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:21,599
No, no, no, no, no!

1234
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:22,850
Please, Ralph!

1235
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:23,934
No!

1236
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:28,230
Stop it! Stop it! No!

1237
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:46,832
You really are a bad guy.

1238
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:25,537
Hello? Anybody home?

1239
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:28,290
Felix? Mary?

1240
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:31,251
Well, you actually went and did it.

1241
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,088
Gene. Where is everybody?

1242
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,839
They're gone.

1243
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:39,426
After Felix went to find you
and then didn't come back...

1244
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:41,845
Everyone panicked
and abandoned ship.

1245
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,972
But I'm here now.

1246
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:45,974
It's too late, Ralph.

1247
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,435
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning.

1248
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:55,776
Oh!

1249
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:03,784
But never let it be said
that I'm not a man of my word.

1250
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:06,787
The place is yours, Ralph. Enjoy.

1251
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:12,000
Gene, wait! Wait!

1252
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,879
Listen, this is not what I wanted!

1253
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,006
Well, what did you want, Ralph?

1254
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,467
I don't know. I just...

1255
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:26,473
I was just tired of
living alone in the garbage.

1256
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:30,477
Well, now you can live alone
in the penthouse.

1257
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:38,879
Hey, cough drop.

1258
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:41,215
Explain something to me.

1259
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,550
If Vanellope was never meant to exist,

1260
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:46,428
then why is her picture on
the side of the game console?

1261
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:48,263
Uh...

1262
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:52,142
What's going on

1263
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:53,644
in this candy-coated heart of darkness?

1264
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:54,770
Nothing.

1265
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:55,896
Talk!
No.

1266
01:11:56,063 --> 01:11:57,564
I'll lick you.
You wouldn't.

1267
01:11:57,648 --> 01:11:59,441
Oh, yeah?

1268
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,026
Oh! That's like sandpaper!

1269
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:03,737
Mmm. Wonder how many
licks it will take

1270
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:05,155
to get to your center.

1271
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:06,740
I'll take it to my grave!

1272
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,075
Fair enough.

1273
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:10,410
Oh!

1274
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:13,747
They call you
Sour Bill for a reason.

1275
01:12:14,832 --> 01:12:18,085
Had enough yet?
Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk!

1276
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:19,795
Vanellope was a racer

1277
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,339
until King Candy
tried to delete her code!

1278
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:24,508
Tried to delete her code?

1279
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:27,594
So that's why she's a glitch!
Why is he doing this to her?

1280
01:12:27,928 --> 01:12:28,971
I don't know!

1281
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:30,222
Suit yourself.

1282
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,266
No, no, no! I swear I don't know!

1283
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:35,143
He literally locked up our memories

1284
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:36,436
and I cannot remember!

1285
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:37,813
Nobody can!

1286
01:12:38,272 --> 01:12:39,648
But I do know this.

1287
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,608
He'll do anything
to keep her from racing.

1288
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:44,194
Because if she crosses the finish line,

1289
01:12:44,278 --> 01:12:47,114
the game will reset and
she won't be a glitch anymore!

1290
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:48,448
Where is she now?

1291
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:49,867
In the fungeon with Fix-It Felix.

1292
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:51,118
Felix?

1293
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,995
I'm sorry! That's all I know, I swear!

1294
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:57,291
Now, please, don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again!

1295
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:00,794
Stick around.

1296
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:04,006
Yes, okay, I will. I will. Thank you!

1297
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:09,803
Come on. I know you're out there.

1298
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,640
Saccharine-saturated nightmare!

1299
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:19,021
But... Where?

1300
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:40,292
Doomsday and Armageddon
just had a baby and it is ugly!

1301
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:44,338
Hello? Hello?

1302
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:48,717
Somebody! Anybody! Please let me out!

1303
01:13:50,844 --> 01:13:51,887
What's he say?

1304
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:54,348
I'm gonna wreck it!

1305
01:13:58,226 --> 01:14:01,188
Why do I fix everything I touch?

1306
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,981
Oh!

1307
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:04,483
Bam!

1308
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:07,069
Felix!
Ralph!

1309
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:09,363
I'm so glad to see you!

1310
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:13,075
Wait. No, I'm not. What do
you have to say for yourself!

1311
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:16,203
Wait! I don't want to hear it.
I'm not talking to you!

1312
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:18,038
Okay, don't talk. That's fine.

1313
01:14:18,205 --> 01:14:20,123
But you have to fix
this go-cart for me pronto.

1314
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:23,377
I don't have to do boo!
Forgive my potty mouth.

1315
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:26,421
I'm just so, so cross with you!

1316
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:28,715
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1317
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,219
I ran higgledy-piggledy
all over creation looking for you.

1318
01:14:32,427 --> 01:14:34,304
I almost drowned in chocolate milk-mix!

1319
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:38,225
And then... I met the most dynamite gal.

1320
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,979
Oh! She gives me the honey glow
something awful.

1321
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:45,399
But she rebuffed my affections.

1322
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,609
And then I got thrown in jail!

1323
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:49,236
Felix, pull yourself together.

1324
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:53,115
No! You don't know
what it's like to be rejected

1325
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,908
and treated like a criminal!

1326
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:57,661
Yes, I do. That's every day of my life.

1327
01:14:58,745 --> 01:14:59,746
It is?

1328
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:03,750
Which is why I ran off
and tried to be a good guy, but I'm not!

1329
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:06,628
I'm just a bad guy, and I need your help.

1330
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,047
There's a little girl
whose only hope is this cart.

1331
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:11,133
Please, Felix, fix it.

1332
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:14,720
And I promise I will never try
to be good again.

1333
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:27,774
Huh?

1334
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:40,620
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.

1335
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:44,249
And?
And a real numskull.

1336
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:47,169
And?
A selfish diaper baby.

1337
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:48,378
And?

1338
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,297
And...

1339
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,507
A stinkbrain?

1340
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:55,594
The stinkiest brain ever.

1341
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:19,409
My sweet subjects,

1342
01:16:20,077 --> 01:16:23,330
I can without a pinch
of hesitation assure you

1343
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:26,458
that I have never been
so happy in all my life

1344
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,835
to say the following words,

1345
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:32,255
let the Random Roster Race
commence!

1346
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:52,359
Okay, remember, you don't have to win.

1347
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:55,028
Just cross that finish line,
and you'll be a real racer.

1348
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:57,197
I'm already a real racer.

1349
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:01,034
And I'm going to win.

1350
01:17:31,857 --> 01:17:33,108
Whoa!

1351
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:43,660
Have some candy.

1352
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:03,263
Behind you!

1353
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:05,599
In front of you!

1354
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,231
Huh?

1355
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,443
It's The Glitch!
The Glitch?

1356
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:18,069
Light them up, Candlehead.

1357
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:24,367
What's this? Cherry bombs!

1358
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:34,628
I told you. You're just
an accident waiting to happen.

1359
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,647
My candle!

1360
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:57,359
All right. Gotta keep it under control.

1361
01:18:57,442 --> 01:18:58,985
No more glitching.

1362
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:02,155
Okay, kid. Let's finish this thing

1363
01:19:02,197 --> 01:19:03,657
without any more surprises.

1364
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:05,408
Ow!

1365
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:06,993
Hope you're happy, junkpile.

1366
01:19:07,035 --> 01:19:10,121
This game is going down,
and it's all your fault.

1367
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:11,748
My lady, you came back.

1368
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:13,208
Can it, Fix-It!

1369
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:16,002
That Cy-Bug you brought
with you multiplied.

1370
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:19,047
No. It died in the taffy swamp.
Believe me, I...

1371
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:23,677
Bullroar.

1372
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:34,271
Listen up, people. Head to
Game Central Station now!

1373
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,314
Move it! Let's go! Let's go!

1374
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:38,149
Go! Go! Go!

1375
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:47,492
No!

1376
01:20:27,115 --> 01:20:28,116
Huh?

1377
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,744
Get off of my track!

1378
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,078
Hey!

1379
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:33,580
What, are you crazy!

1380
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:39,461
I forbid you to cross that finish line!

1381
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:42,297
Knock it off!

1382
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:46,343
Ralph, look!

1383
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:48,094
Kid!

1384
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:52,182
Stop it!

1385
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,268
I'm not letting you
undo all my hard work!

1386
01:20:57,604 --> 01:20:58,938
Is that...

1387
01:21:01,775 --> 01:21:03,610
No way!

1388
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:06,654
What the... Who are you?

1389
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:11,034
I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever!

1390
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:13,787
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

1391
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:17,082
and that halitosis-riddled warthog

1392
01:21:17,123 --> 01:21:18,875
take it away from me!

1393
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:21,503
Turbo-tastic.

1394
01:21:23,213 --> 01:21:25,048
End of the line, Glitch!

1395
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:28,218
Glitch. That's it.

1396
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,178
Come on, Vanellope.

1397
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,971
I know you said you wouldn't do it again

1398
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:34,140
but you're going to do it one more time.

1399
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:36,393
Just focus and concentrate

1400
01:21:36,518 --> 01:21:39,646
and glitch!

1401
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,820
Sweet mother of monkey milk! I did it!

1402
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:49,906
No!

1403
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:59,416
Bring it home, kid!
The finish line is wide open!

1404
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,682
No!

1405
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:18,518
Kid! Are you okay?

1406
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,021
I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's finish this race!

1407
01:22:24,941 --> 01:22:26,276
Oh, my land.

1408
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:28,111
All right. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1409
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:30,280
But I didn't cross the finish line!

1410
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:32,198
There is no finish line!

1411
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:35,535
Move it or lose it, people.
Everybody, out. Now!

1412
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:39,372
Ralph, it's not going to work!

1413
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:40,540
We got to try!

1414
01:22:43,543 --> 01:22:44,711
Kid!

1415
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:47,213
Ralph, I told you I can't leave the game.

1416
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:49,966
Come on. Get through.
Ralph! Stop!

1417
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,469
It's got to work!

1418
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,637
Stop, it's no use.

1419
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:04,272
It's okay, Ralph.

1420
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:07,567
All right, Fix-It.

1421
01:23:07,734 --> 01:23:10,403
That's everyone.
Now, we've got to blow up this exit.

1422
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:15,074
Just go. Go without me.

1423
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:18,912
But what about this game?
Nothing we can do about it.

1424
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:22,499
Without a beacon, there's
no way to stop these monsters.

1425
01:23:25,627 --> 01:23:26,753
Beacon?

1426
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:29,547
Stay with Felix.

1427
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,007
Let me borrow that thing, lady.

1428
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,260
Ralph! Where are you going?
I got some wrecking to do!

1429
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:36,221
I'll meet you at the finish line!

1430
01:23:36,304 --> 01:23:37,347
No! Wait!

1431
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,848
Fix-It, get behind me!

1432
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:54,906
Come on!

1433
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:01,204
One more! One...

1434
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:02,747
Oh!

1435
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:05,416
Welcome to the boss level!

1436
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:06,751
Turbo.

1437
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:09,796
Because of you, Ralph,

1438
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:14,050
I'm now the most powerful
virus in the arcade!

1439
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:16,553
I can take over any game I want.

1440
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:18,429
I should thank you

1441
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:21,266
but it would be more fun to kill you.

1442
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:25,311
Get back here, little guy!

1443
01:24:30,316 --> 01:24:32,485
Have some candy!

1444
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,655
Where do you think you're going?

1445
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:43,454
I'm not through with you yet. Up we go!

1446
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:44,747
No!

1447
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:47,375
Ralph!

1448
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:52,505
Fall back.

1449
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:55,508
Kid!

1450
01:25:01,347 --> 01:25:02,599
Vanellope!

1451
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:05,476
Oh, look at that. It's your little friend.

1452
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:08,605
Let's watch her die together, shall we?

1453
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:09,939
No!

1454
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:14,777
It's game over for both of you.

1455
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:18,197
No. Just for me!

1456
01:25:20,867 --> 01:25:21,993
Ralph!
Vanellope!

1457
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,752
I'm bad, and that's good.

1458
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:34,047
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

1459
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:38,968
There's no one I'd rather be...

1460
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:42,472
...than me.

1461
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:11,584
Kid!

1462
01:26:11,793 --> 01:26:14,879
Don't worry. I got it under control.

1463
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,907
You fools! Why are you
going into the ligh...

1464
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:48,162
No! No, no, no. Yes...

1465
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:51,124
No! Yes... No!

1466
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:54,544
Go into the light!

1467
01:26:58,923 --> 01:26:59,966
Whoa!

1468
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:03,344
Chocolate?

1469
01:27:04,804 --> 01:27:07,056
It's chocolate! I love chocolate!

1470
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,851
Oh, beautiful chocolate!

1471
01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:10,977
Yeah!

1472
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:15,481
You did it, Ralph! Way to go, brother!

1473
01:27:21,654 --> 01:27:23,322
I... Excuse...

1474
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:31,789
All fixed.

1475
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:35,042
You ready for this?
As ready as I'll ever be.

1476
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:43,634
Whoa!

1477
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:46,554
What's with all the magic sparkles?

1478
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:17,043
Princess Vanellope?

1479
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:19,170
Now I remember.

1480
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:24,592
All hail the rightful ruler
of Sugar Rush...

1481
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:26,385
Princess Vanellope.

1482
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,388
I remember. She's our princess!

1483
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,723
Oh, that's right!

1484
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:32,642
We are so sorry
about the way we treated you.

1485
01:28:32,809 --> 01:28:34,227
Yeah, those were jokes!

1486
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:37,146
I was just doing
what Taffyta told me to do!

1487
01:28:37,939 --> 01:28:39,065
Tut-tut.

1488
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:42,735
As your merciful princess,
I hereby decree

1489
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:47,323
that everyone who was ever
mean to me shall be

1490
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,783
executed.

1491
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:51,327
What? No, please!

1492
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:52,745
Oh, my land.

1493
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:55,081
Oh! This place just got interesting.

1494
01:28:55,164 --> 01:28:57,416
I don't want to die!

1495
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:01,087
I'm just kidding. Stop crying, Taffyta.

1496
01:29:01,254 --> 01:29:03,089
I'm trying, but it won't stop.

1497
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:05,758
Wow.

1498
01:29:05,925 --> 01:29:09,011
So this is the real you. Princess.

1499
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:13,099
Aw, Ralph, what are you, nuts?
Come on. This isn't me.

1500
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:16,686
This is me.

1501
01:29:16,978 --> 01:29:18,312
Huh?

1502
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:19,939
Look, the code may say I'm a princess

1503
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:21,649
but I know who I really am, Ralph,

1504
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,861
I'm a racer with
the greatest superpower ever.

1505
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:26,445
I was here, I was there.

1506
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:28,447
I was glitching through the walls.

1507
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:29,615
I'm not giving that up.

1508
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:31,784
Um, pardon me for asking,

1509
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:35,079
but without a princess,
who's going to lead us?

1510
01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:36,163
Yeah. Who?

1511
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:40,084
Uh, me.
I'm thinking more along the lines of

1512
01:29:40,126 --> 01:29:42,295
a constitutional democracy.

1513
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:45,840
President Vanellope von Schweetz.

1514
01:29:45,965 --> 01:29:47,633
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

1515
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:51,554
Fix-It, Wreck-It,
the arcade's about to open.

1516
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:53,556
Let's move 'em out.

1517
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:03,816
You could just stay here
and live in the castle.

1518
01:30:03,983 --> 01:30:05,192
You'd have your own wing

1519
01:30:05,318 --> 01:30:07,028
where no one would ever
complain about your stench

1520
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:09,155
or treat you bad ever again.

1521
01:30:09,322 --> 01:30:11,198
You could be happy.

1522
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:14,368
I'm already happy.

1523
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:16,370
I've got the coolest friend in the world.

1524
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,498
And besides, I've got a job to do, too.

1525
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:23,336
It may not be as fancy
as being president

1526
01:30:23,377 --> 01:30:24,712
but it's my duty.

1527
01:30:24,879 --> 01:30:26,422
And it's a big duty!

1528
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:29,634
Ralph, are you coming, brother?

1529
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:33,846
See you later, President Fart Feathers.

1530
01:30:34,013 --> 01:30:36,974
Au revoir, Admiral Underpants.

1531
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:40,353
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.

1532
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:42,772
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!

1533
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:45,232
Hasta la vista, you...
Ralph!

1534
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:47,818
All right. To be continued.
Yeah!

1535
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,570
Hooray!

1536
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,125
I'm gonna wreck it!

1537
01:31:05,044 --> 01:31:08,214
Hey! Ralph's back! Isn't that great!

1538
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:10,925
The gang's all here!

1539
01:31:11,008 --> 01:31:15,262
So, I'm happy to report,
and you'll be happy to hear,

1540
01:31:15,346 --> 01:31:17,014
I'm taking life one game at a time.

1541
01:31:17,098 --> 01:31:19,392
All right! Yeah, Ralph!

1542
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:21,018
Of course,
the job hasn't changed.

1543
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:25,773
But, news flash,
the Nicelanders are being nice to me!

1544
01:31:26,941 --> 01:31:30,194
And that got me thinking about
those poor guys left without a game.

1545
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:32,780
So here's what we did.
We're gonna wreck it!

1546
01:31:32,947 --> 01:31:35,157
We asked them to help us out
on the bonus levels.

1547
01:31:36,117 --> 01:31:37,284
We can fix it!

1548
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:39,036
I'm telling you, guys,

1549
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:40,913
we haven't been this popular in years.

1550
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,289
It's crazy.
Wow!

1551
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:44,917
The gamers say we're retro,

1552
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:47,837
which I think means old but cool.

1553
01:31:47,962 --> 01:31:49,422
How come
we never noticed this game?

1554
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:51,424
Oh, and I decided
that living in the dump

1555
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:53,092
wasn't making me feel very good,

1556
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:55,761
so I cleaned it up,
built myself a little shack

1557
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:57,513
and a couple for the new guys, too.

1558
01:31:58,764 --> 01:32:01,934
Well, with a little help from Felix. Oh!

1559
01:32:02,268 --> 01:32:04,395
And guess who was the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding.

1560
01:32:05,104 --> 01:32:07,690
That's right, my friends,
old Ham Hands himself.

1561
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:10,359
Very elegant affair.
You should've seen it.

1562
01:32:10,443 --> 01:32:11,944
Lot of grandeur.

1563
01:32:11,986 --> 01:32:13,446
And not a single bug.

1564
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:20,870
Let's just say, some tears were shed.

1565
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:26,125
But I got to say, the best part of my day

1566
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:28,044
is when I get thrown off the roof.

1567
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:31,672
Because when the Nicelanders
lift me up,

1568
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:35,217
I get a perfect view of Sugar Rush.

1569
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:37,303
And I can see Vanellope racing.

1570
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:41,140
Yes!

1571
01:32:42,141 --> 01:32:43,517
The kid's a natural.

1572
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:46,645
And the players love her, glitch and all.

1573
01:32:47,313 --> 01:32:48,814
Just like I knew they would.

1574
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:53,527
Turns out I don't need a medal
to tell me I'm a good guy.

1575
01:32:55,321 --> 01:32:57,323
'Cause if that little kid likes me...

1576
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:02,411
How bad can I be?

1577
01:33:19,178 --> 01:33:22,765
Switch on the sky
and the stars glow for you

1578
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:26,560
Go see the world
'cause it's all so brand new

1579
01:33:26,685 --> 01:33:30,689
Don't close your eyes
'cause your future's ready to shine

1580
01:33:30,773 --> 01:33:34,443
It's just a matter of time
before we learn how to fly

1581
01:33:35,736 --> 01:33:39,115
Welcome to the rhythm of the night

1582
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:42,785
There's something in the air
you can't deny

1583
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:50,960
It's been fun but now I've got to go

1584
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:54,338
Life is way too short to take it slow

1585
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:58,384
But before I go and hit the road

1586
01:33:59,385 --> 01:34:04,140
I gotta know, 'til then
when can we do this again?

1587
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:08,269
When can I see you again?

1588
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:12,148
When can we do this again?

1589
01:34:14,775 --> 01:34:19,363
I gotta know
when can I see you again?

1590
01:34:23,242 --> 01:34:26,662
Joined at the hip
your sidekick needs you

1591
01:34:27,079 --> 01:34:30,291
Life is a trip down
the road that leads you

1592
01:34:30,749 --> 01:34:34,461
Look all around at the mountains
you haven't climbed

1593
01:34:34,628 --> 01:34:38,132
It's just a matter of time
before we learn how to fly

1594
01:34:39,633 --> 01:34:42,887
Welcome to the rhythm of the night

1595
01:34:43,262 --> 01:34:46,348
There's something in the air
you can't deny

1596
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:54,607
It's been fun but now I've got to go

1597
01:34:55,274 --> 01:34:58,068
Life is way too short to take it slow

1598
01:34:59,236 --> 01:35:02,156
But before I go and hit the road

1599
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:07,953
I gotta know, 'til then
when can we do this again?

1600
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:11,916
When can I see you again?

1601
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,920
When can we do this again?

1602
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:23,636
I gotta know
When can I see you again?

1603
01:35:30,768 --> 01:35:34,438
Don't close your eyes
'cause your future's ready to shine

1604
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:38,025
It's just a matter of time
before we learn how to fly

1605
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:42,905
Welcome to the rhythm of the night

1606
01:35:43,364 --> 01:35:46,575
There's something in the air
you can't deny

1607
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:50,746
So let me know before I wave goodbye

1608
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:53,374
When can I see you again?

1609
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:58,629
When can we do this again?

1610
01:35:58,796 --> 01:36:01,632
When can I see you again?

1611
01:36:02,591 --> 01:36:05,302
When can we do this again?

1612
01:36:06,428 --> 01:36:09,348
Yeah, it's been fun
but now I've got to go

1613
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:13,269
Life is way too short
to take it slow

1614
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:19,400
But before I go and hit the road
Tell me when

1615
01:36:21,068 --> 01:36:24,154
When can I see you again?

1616
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:27,700
When can I see you again?

1617
01:36:28,909 --> 01:36:31,245
When can I see you again?

1618
01:39:11,864 --> 01:39:14,700
Wreck-It Ralph is a giant of a man

1619
01:39:14,783 --> 01:39:17,953
Nine feet tall with really big hands

1620
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:21,081
Living in a stump on his very own land

1621
01:39:21,165 --> 01:39:24,418
Until his world went crazy

1622
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:27,963
He was minding his own business
on the day they came

1623
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:31,383
They showed a piece of paper
saying eminent domain

1624
01:39:31,425 --> 01:39:34,678
They built an apartment building
saying progress was to blame

1625
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:38,182
So he got mad
And he turned bad

1626
01:39:38,223 --> 01:39:41,518
Brick by brick
he's gonna take his land back

1627
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,730
Wreck it, Wreck-It Ralph
As fast as you can

1628
01:39:44,771 --> 01:39:47,983
You know you can do it
with your colossal hands

1629
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:51,236
So don't let Fix-It Felix
and that building stand

1630
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,656
I wreck it
I fix it

1631
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:58,160
I wreck it
I fix it

1632
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:01,663
You fixed it!

1633
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:11,507
Fix-It Felix is a really great guy

1634
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:14,676
Watch him get all turbocharged
when he eats a pie

1635
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,096
Not just a superintendent
He's a super super guy

1636
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:21,183
And everybody loves him

1637
01:40:21,517 --> 01:40:24,853
With his trusty tool belt
and steel-toed shoes

1638
01:40:24,937 --> 01:40:28,106
Nicelanders believe
that Felix just can't lose

1639
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:31,401
So when Wreck-It Ralph
starts to come unglued

1640
01:40:31,443 --> 01:40:34,571
He doesn't get mad
'Cause he's so rad

1641
01:40:34,863 --> 01:40:38,200
Brick by brick he's gonna build it back

1642
01:40:38,283 --> 01:40:41,245
Fix it, Fix-It Felix, as fast as you can

1643
01:40:41,286 --> 01:40:44,623
Use the magic hammer
you got from your old man

1644
01:40:44,706 --> 01:40:48,126
'Cause you know Wreck-It Ralph
won't let that building stand

1645
01:40:48,168 --> 01:40:54,758
I wreck it
I fix it

1646
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:58,220
You fixed it!

1
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,370
Born of cold and winter air

2
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,604
And mountain rain combining

3
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,883
This icy force both foul and fair

4
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,284
Has a frozen heart worth mining

5
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,289
So out through the heart

6
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,771
Cold and clear

7
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,810
Strike for love and strike for fear

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,691
See the beauty sharp and sheer

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,685
Split the ice apart

10
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,640
And break the frozen heart
Hup, ho

11
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,088
Watch your step
Let it go

12
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,568
Hup, ho

13
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,361
Watch your step
Let it go

14
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,721
Beautiful
Powerful

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,086
Dangerous
Cold

16
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,401
Ice has a magic
Can't be controlled

17
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,641
Stronger than one

18
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,881
Stronger than ten

19
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,765
Stronger than a hundred men!

20
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,126
Oh!

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,567
Born of cold
And winter air

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,881
And mountain rain combining

23
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,281
This icy force both foul and fair

24
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,045
Has a frozen heart worth mining

25
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,446
Cut through the heart

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,646
Cold and clear

27
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,882
Strike for love and strike for fear

28
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,402
There's beauty and there's danger here

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,722
Split the ice apart

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,010
Beware the frozen heart

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,727
Come on, Sven.

32
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,285
Elsa. Psst!

33
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,165
Elsa!

34
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,488
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!

35
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,121
Anna, go back to sleep.

36
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,608
I just can't.

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,725
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.

38
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,929
So, we have to play.

39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,923
Go play by yourself.

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,048
Do you want to build a snowman?

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,727
Come on, come on, come on!

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,687
Do the magic!

43
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,649
Do the magic!

44
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,286
Oh...

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,729
Ready?
Uh-huh.

46
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,929
This is amazing!

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,011
Watch this!

48
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,885
Hi, I'm Olaf,

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,564
and I like warm hugs.

50
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,244
I love you, Olaf!

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,684
Olaf...

52
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,201
Tickle bumps!

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,646
Oh!

54
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,361
Hang on!

55
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,761
Catch me!

56
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,807
Gotcha!

57
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,086
Again!

58
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,401
Wait!

59
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,287
Whoo-hoo!
Slow down!

60
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,567
Whoo!

61
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,846
Anna!

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,326
Anna!

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,843
Mama! Papa!

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,004
No, no...

65
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,085
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

66
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,646
Elsa, what have you done?

67
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,730
This is getting out of hand.

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,243
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna!

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,165
Oh. She's ice cold.
I know where we have to go.

70
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,246
Ice?

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,845
Faster, Sven.

72
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,921
Sven!

73
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,882
Please! Help! It's my daughter.

74
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,327
It's the king.

75
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,129
Trolls?
Shush!

76
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,605
I'm trying to listen.

77
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,771
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

78
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,245
Your Majesty.

79
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,284
Born with the powers, or cursed?

80
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,801
Born.
And they're getting stronger.

81
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,331
Here, here.

82
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,164
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

83
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,530
The heart is not so easily changed.

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,326
But the head can be persuaded.

85
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,210
Do what you must.

86
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,886
I recommend we remove all magic.

87
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,642
Even memories of magic, to be safe.

88
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,609
But don't worry. I'll leave the fun.

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,011
She will be okay.

90
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,688
But she won't remember I have powers?

91
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,691
It's for the best.

92
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,084
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.

93
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,721
There is beauty in it...

94
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,089
But also great danger.

95
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,560
You must learn to control it.

96
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,363
Fear will be your enemy.

97
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,361
No!

98
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,051
We'll protect her.

99
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,248
She can learn to control it. I'm sure.

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,845
Until then...

101
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,644
We'll look the gates.

102
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,320
We'll reduce the staff.

103
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,687
We will limit her contact with people,

104
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,844
and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.

105
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,970
Including Anna.

106
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,324
Ah.

107
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,166
Elsa?

108
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,645
Do you wanna build a snowman?

109
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,447
Come on, let's go and play

110
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,403
I never see you anymore

111
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,846
Come out the door

112
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,606
It's like you've gone away

113
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,721
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not

114
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,801
I wish you would tell me why

115
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,766
Do you wanna build a snowman?

116
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,691
It doesn't
have to be a snowman

117
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,410
Go away, Anna.

118
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,330
Okay, bye

119
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,691
The gloves will help.

120
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,089
See? Conceal it.

121
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,770
Don't feel it.

122
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,524
Don't let it show.

123
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,365
Do you wanna build a snowman?

124
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,681
Or ride our bike around the halls?

125
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,882
I think some company is overdue

126
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,804
I've started talking
To the pictures on the walls

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,001
Hang in there, Joan.

128
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,562
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms

129
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,491
Just watching the hours tick by

130
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,886
I'm scared.

131
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,961
It's getting stronger!

132
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,805
Getting upset only makes it worse.
Calm down.

133
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,609
No! Don't touch me!

134
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,808
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

135
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,484
See you in two weeks!

136
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,761
Do you have to go?

137
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,169
You'll be fine, Elsa.

138
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,125
Your Highness.

139
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,441
Elsa?

140
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,687
Please
I know you're in there

141
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,247
People are asking where you've been

142
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,129
They say Have courage
And I'm trying to

143
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,489
I'm right out here for you

144
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,807
Just let me in

145
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,850
We only have each other
It's just you and me

146
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,371
What are we gonna do?

147
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,040
Do you wanna build a snowman?

148
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,010
All ashore!

149
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,286
Welcome to Arendelle!

150
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,960
Watch your step, please.

151
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,690
The gates will be opening soon.

152
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,643
Why do I have to wear this?

153
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,848
Because the queen has come of age.

154
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,724
It's Coronation Day!

155
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,609
That's not my fault.

156
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,043
What do you want, Sven?

157
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,360
Give me a snack.

158
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,044
What's the magic word?

159
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,121
Please.

160
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,089
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.

161
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,762
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

162
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,481
And for a whole day!
Faster, Percy!

163
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,807
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

164
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,124
Open those gates so I may unlock

165
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,641
your secrets and exploit your riches.

166
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,526
Did I say that out loud?

167
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,410
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait

168
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,130
to see the queen and the princess.

169
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,288
I bet they are absolutely lovely.

170
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,482
I bet they are beautiful.

171
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,164
Princess Anna?

172
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,402
Princess Anna?
Huh? Yeah?

173
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,566
Oh. Sorry to wake you, ma'am.

174
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,444
No, no, no, you didn't.

175
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,090
I've been up for hours.

176
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,766
Who is it?

177
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,604
Still me, ma'am.

178
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,445
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.

179
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,562
Of course.

180
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,801
Ready for what?

181
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,360
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

182
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,761
My sister's corneration.

183
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,648
It's Coronation Day!

184
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,763
It's Coronation Day!

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,126
The window is open!

186
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,281
So's that door!

187
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,601
I didn't know they did that anymore

188
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,730
Who knew we owned
8,000 salad plates?

189
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,562
For years I've roamed these empty halls

190
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,162
Why have a ballroom with no balls?

191
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,565
Finally
They're opening up the gates!

192
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,526
There'll be actual, real, live people

193
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,523
It'll be totally strange

194
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,650
But wow!
Am I so ready for this change!

195
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,249
'Cause for the first time in forever

196
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,165
There'll be music

197
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,005
There'll be light

198
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,322
For the first time

199
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,402
In forever

200
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,448
I'll be dancing through the night

201
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,728
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy

202
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,565
But I'm somewhere in that zone

203
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,602
'Cause for the first time in forever

204
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,449
I won't be alone

205
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,410
I can't wait to meet everyone!

206
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,966
What if I meet The One?

207
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,040
Tonight
Imagine me gown and all

208
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,361
Fetchingly draped against the wall

209
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,764
The picture of sophisticated grace

210
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,367
I suddenly see him standing there

211
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,601
A beautiful stranger

212
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,681
Tall and fair

213
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,322
I wanna stuff some chocolate
in my face!

214
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,091
But then we laugh and talk all evening

215
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,367
Which is totally bizarre

216
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,445
Nothing like the life
I've led so far

217
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,805
For the first time in forever

218
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,483
There'll be magic
There'll be fun

219
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,964
For the first time in forever

220
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,683
I could be noticed by someone

221
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,367
And I know it is totally crazy

222
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,001
To dream I'd find romance

223
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,009
But for the first time in forever

224
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,087
At least I've got a chance!

225
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,569
Don't let them in

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,002
Don't let them see

227
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,891
Be the good girl

228
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,530
You always have to be

229
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,846
Conceal

230
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,851
Don't feel

231
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,043
Put on a show

232
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,846
Make one wrong move

233
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,491
And everyone will know

234
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,405
But it's only for today

235
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,447
It's only for today

236
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,285
It's agony to wait

237
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,291
Tell the guards to open up

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,401
The gate

239
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,528
The gate

240
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,969
For the first time in forever

241
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,326
Don't let them in
Don't let them see

242
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,041
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of

243
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,241
Be the good girl

244
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,526
You always have to be

245
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,971
A chance to change

246
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,804
My lonely world

247
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,120
Conceal

248
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,443
A chance to find true love

249
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,522
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know

250
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,648
I know it all ends tomorrow

251
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,570
So it has to be today!

252
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,568
'Cause for the first time in forever

253
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,481
For the first time

254
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,962
In forever

255
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,925
Nothing's in my way!

256
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,841
Hey!

257
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,251
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

258
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,685
Hey.

259
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,683
Uh...
No, no, I'm okay.

260
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,886
Are you sure?

261
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,645
Yeah.
I just wasn't looking where I was going.

262
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,802
But I'm great, actually.

263
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,089
Oh... Thank goodness.

264
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,080
Oh! Uh...

265
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,929
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

266
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,249
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

267
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,845
Princess? My Lady.

268
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,126
Oh!

269
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,004
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

270
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,445
Um...
Whew.

271
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,011
Hi. Again.

272
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,809
Oh, boy!

273
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,721
This is awkward.

274
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,444
Not You're awkward,
but just because we're...

275
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,841
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?

276
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,295
I'd like to formally apologize

277
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,527
for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.

278
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,930
And for every moment after.

279
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,445
No! No, no. It's fine.

280
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,806
I'm not that princess.

281
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,604
I mean, if you had hit my sister Elsa,

282
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,444
it would be... Yeesh!

283
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,010
Because, you know...

284
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,286
Hello.

285
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,084
But, lucky you,

286
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,044
it's just me.

287
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,687
Just you?

288
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,845
The bells. The coronation.

289
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,082
I better go.

290
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,731
I have to go. I better go. Uh...

291
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,401
Bye!

292
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,924
Oh, no. Oh!

293
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,402
Your Majesty, the gloves.

294
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,204
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

295
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,722
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!

296
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,371
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

297
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,925
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

298
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,406
Oh. Here? Are you sure?

299
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,606
Because I don't think I'm supposed to...

300
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,920
Oh. Okay.

301
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,047
Hi.

302
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,044
Hi me? Oh...

303
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,930
Um... Hi.

304
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,086
You look beautiful.

305
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,208
Thank you.
You look beautiful-ler.

306
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,770
I mean, not fuller. You don't look fuller.

307
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,887
But more beautiful.

308
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,769
Thank you.

309
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,126
So...

310
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,209
This is what a party looks like.

311
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,125
It's warmer than I thought.

312
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,328
What is that amazing smell?

313
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,326
Chocolate.

314
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,520
Your Majesty.

315
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,645
The Duke of Weaseltown.
Weselton!

316
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,644
Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.

317
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,403
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting

318
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,606
that I offer you

319
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,250
your first dance as queen.

320
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,965
One-two, and jump.

321
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,481
Uh...

322
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,649
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.

323
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,846
Oh...

324
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,967
But my sister does.

325
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,281
What?
Oh! Lucky you.

326
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,447
Oh, I don't think...

327
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,727
If you swoon, let me know.
I'll catch you.

328
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,565
Sorry.

329
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,449
Like an agile peacock.

330
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,329
Ow! Ow.

331
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,364
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

332
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,522
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

333
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,451
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

334
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,249
No.
No.

335
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,691
All right. Hang on!

336
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,645
They don't call me
the Little Dipper for nothing!

337
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,801
Oh-ho!

338
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,327
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.

339
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:01,495
Let me know when you're ready

340
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,601
for another round, Milady.

341
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,451
Well, he was sprightly.

342
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,764
Especially for a man in heels.

343
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,450
Are you okay?

344
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,249
I've never been better. This is so nice.

345
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,722
I wish it could be like this all the time.

346
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,560
Me, too.

347
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,401
But it can't.

348
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,482
Why not?
It just can't.

349
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,370
Excuse me for a minute.

350
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,849
I'd be honored.

351
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,481
Glad I caught you.

352
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,926
Hans.

353
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,965
Oop.

354
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,402
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!

355
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,403
Oh!
Oops!

356
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,851
Sorry.

357
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,251
Your physique helps, I'm sure, too.

358
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,606
Ah.

359
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,207
What's this?

360
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,691
Uh, I was born with it.

361
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,967
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.

362
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,520
I like it.

363
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,204
Yeah, the whole thing.

364
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,361
You got it.

365
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,366
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have how many brothers?

366
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,489
Twelve older brothers.

367
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,888
Three of them pretended I was invisible,

368
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,123
literally, for two years.

369
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,446
That's horrible.

370
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,086
It's what brothers do.

371
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,811
And sisters.

372
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,441
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.

373
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,922
But then, one day, she just shut me out,

374
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,321
and I never knew why.

375
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,925
I would never shut you out.

376
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,761
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

377
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,366
I love crazy.

378
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,249
All my life has been
A series of doors in my face

379
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,326
And then suddenly
I bump into you

380
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,687
I was thinking the same thing,
because, like...

381
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,842
I've been searching my whole life

382
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,809
To find my own place

383
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,561
And maybe it's the party talking

384
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,681
Or the chocolate fondue

385
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,807
But with you

386
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,042
But with you I found my place

387
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,770
I see your face

388
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,765
And it's nothing like
I've ever known before

389
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,807
Love is an open

390
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,009
Door!

391
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,771
Love is an open

392
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,969
Door
Door

393
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,447
Love is an open door

394
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,205
With you
With you

395
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,045
Love is an open door

396
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,841
I mean, it's crazy
What?

397
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,122
We finish each other's
Sandwiches

398
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,486
That's what I was gonna say!

399
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,686
I've never met someone

400
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,762
Who thinks so much like me

401
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,291
Jinx! Jinx again!

402
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,809
Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation

403
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,401
You
And I

404
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,481
Were
Just

405
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,050
Meant to be

406
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,687
Say goodbye
Say goodbye

407
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,604
To the pain of the past

408
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,249
We don't have to feel it anymore

409
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,446
Love is an open door

410
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,885
Love is an open

411
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,049
Door
Door

412
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,043
Life can be so much more

413
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,044
With you
With you

414
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,406
Love is an open

415
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,962
Door
Door

416
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,249
Can I say something crazy?

417
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,244
Will you marry me?

418
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,444
Can I say something even crazier?

419
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,001
Yes!

420
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,369
Coming through.
Excuse me. Oh...

421
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,285
Pardon. Sorry.
Oh!

422
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,885
Can we just get around you there?

423
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,044
Thank you. Oh! There she is.

424
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,361
Elsa!

425
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,125
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...

426
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,887
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

427
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,770
Your Majesty.

428
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,481
We would like...

429
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,561
Uh, your blessing...

430
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,604
Of our marriage.

431
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,884
Marriage?
Yes!

432
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,566
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

433
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,881
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

434
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,803
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

435
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,121
Of course, we'll have soup, roast and ice
cream. And then...

436
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,361
Wait. Would we live here?

437
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,723
Here?
Absolutely!

438
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,801
Anna!
Oh!

439
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,370
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

440
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,686
What? No, no, no.

441
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,888
Of course we have the room.
Wait, slow down.

442
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,044
No one's brothers are staying here.

443
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,485
No one is getting married.

444
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,246
Wait, what?

445
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,164
May I talk to you, please? Alone.

446
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,401
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

447
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,806
Fine.
You can't marry a man you just met.

448
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,969
You can if it's true love.

449
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,929
Anna, what do you know
about true love?

450
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,087
More than you.

451
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,924
All you know is how to shut people out.

452
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,771
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

453
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,487
Now, excuse me.

454
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,170
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...

455
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,360
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.

456
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,525
The party is over. Close the gates.

457
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:01,695
Yes, Your Majesty.
What?

458
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,210
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

459
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,401
Give me my glove!

460
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,330
Elsa, please, please.

461
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,204
I can't live like this anymore!

462
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,127
Then leave.

463
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,365
What did I ever do to you?

464
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,646
Enough, Anna.

465
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,768
No, why? Why do you shut me out?

466
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,485
Why do you shut the world out?

467
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,324
What are you so afraid of?

468
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,290
I said, enough!

469
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,806
Sorcery.

470
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,886
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

471
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,846
Elsa.

472
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,041
There she is!

473
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,087
Yes! It is her!

474
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,286
Queen Elsa.

475
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,050
Our beautiful queen!

476
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,528
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

477
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,881
No.

478
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,846
There she is! Stop her!

479
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,208
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away.

480
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,562
Monster. Monster!

481
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,606
Elsa!

482
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,524
Elsa!

483
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,880
Wait, please!

484
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,370
Elsa, stop!

485
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,601
Anna!

486
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,801
No.

487
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,766
The fjord.

488
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,524
Snow!
Snow?

489
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,927
Yes, snow.

490
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,764
Are you all right?
No.

491
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,365
Did you know?

492
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,087
No.

493
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,525
Look, it's snowing. It's snowing!

494
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,244
The queen has cursed this land!

495
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,522
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.

496
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,840
Wait, no!

497
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,446
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

498
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,010
Are you a monster, too?

499
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,084
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.

500
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,650
That's right, she is.

501
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,124
In the best way.

502
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,890
And my sister is not a monster.

503
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,530
She nearly killed me!

504
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,125
You slipped on ice.
Her ice.

505
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,441
It was an accident. She was scared.

506
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,491
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.

507
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,321
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.

508
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,726
So, I'm the one

509
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,046
that needs to go after her.
What?

510
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,441
Bring me my horse, please.
Anna, no.

511
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,726
It's too dangerous.

512
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,730
Elsa is not dangerous.

513
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,001
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.

514
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,081
I'm coming with you.

515
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,369
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.

516
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,365
On my honor.

517
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,045
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

518
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,725
Are you sure you can trust her?

519
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,771
I don't want you getting hurt.

520
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,401
She's my sister.

521
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,331
She would never hurt me.

522
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,683
The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight

523
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,764
Not a footprint to be seen

524
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,689
A kingdom of isolation

525
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,606
And it looks like
I'm the queen

526
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,288
The wind is howling

527
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,081
Like this swirling storm inside

528
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,962
Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I tried

529
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,528
Don't let them in
Don't let them see

530
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,047
Be the good girl
You always have to be

531
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,842
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know

532
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,289
Well, now they know

533
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,008
Let it go!
Let it go!

534
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,369
Can't hold me back anymore

535
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,849
Let it go!
Let it go!

536
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,403
Turn away and slam the door

537
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,607
I don't care

538
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,008
What they're going to say

539
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,048
Let the storm rage on

540
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,331
The cold never bothered me anyway

541
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,643
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small

542
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,683
And the fears that once controlled me

543
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,731
Can't get to me at all

544
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,682
It's time to see what I can do

545
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,207
To test the limits and break through

546
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,765
No right, no wrong

547
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,922
No rules for me

548
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,164
I'm free!

549
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,291
Let it go!

550
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,210
Let it go!

551
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,808
I am one with the wind and sky

552
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,202
Let it go!
Let it go!

553
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,928
You'll never see me cry

554
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,008
Here I stand

555
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,731
And here I'll stay

556
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,607
Let the storm rage on

557
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,770
My power flurries through the air

558
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,003
Into the ground

559
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,042
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals

560
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,248
All around

561
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,680
And one thought crystallizes
Like an icy blast

562
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,286
I'm never going back

563
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,691
The past is in the past

564
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,284
Let it go!
Let it go!

565
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,288
And I'll rise like the break of dawn

566
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,609
Let it go!
Let it go!

567
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,801
That perfect girl is gone

568
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,446
Here I stand

569
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,281
In the light of day

570
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,205
Let the storm rage on!

571
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,811
The cold never bothered me anyway

572
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,251
Elsa!

573
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,800
Elsa!

574
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,204
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

575
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,450
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.

576
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,769
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

577
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,855
Of course, none of it
would have happened

578
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,644
if she had just told me her secret.

579
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,811
She's a stinker.

580
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,005
Whoa!

581
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,446
Oh, no. No, no, no! Come back!

582
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,011
No, no, no!

583
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,251
Okay.

584
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,968
Snow. It had to be snow.

585
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,162
She couldn't have had tropical magic

586
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,608
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...

587
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,885
Fire!

588
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,330
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.

589
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,324
Ooh. And sauna!

590
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,211
Yoo-hoo.
Hmm?

591
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,766
Big summer blowout.

592
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,242
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

593
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,006
and a sun balm
of my own invention, yah?

594
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,602
Oh. Great.
For now, um, how about boots?

595
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,924
Winter boots and dresses?

596
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,369
That would be in our winter department.

597
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,731
Oh. Um...

598
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,480
I was just wondering.

599
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,648
Has another young woman...

600
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,451
The queen perhaps, I don't know,

601
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,601
passed through here?

602
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,171
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

603
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,049
is you, dear.

604
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,120
You and this fellow.

605
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,247
Yoo-hoo.

606
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,446
Big summer blowout.

607
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,601
Carrots.

608
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,926
Huh?

609
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,851
Behind you.

610
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,169
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

611
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,442
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?

612
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,004
Wherever could it be coming from?

613
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,211
The North Mountain.

614
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,120
North Mountain.

615
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,846
That Will be 40.

616
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,570
Forty? No, 10.

617
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,727
Oh, dear, that's no good.

618
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,769
See, this is from our winter stock,

619
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,849
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

620
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,962
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?

621
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,327
I sell ice for a living.

622
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,760
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

623
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,041
I mean, that is really...

624
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,560
That's unfortunate.

625
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,721
Still 40.

626
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,848
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

627
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,009
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.

628
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,686
Yoo-hoo!

629
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,441
Ten is all I got. Help me out.

630
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,401
Okay. Ten will get you this and no more.

631
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,801
Okay, just tell me one thing.

632
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,769
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

633
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,569
Did it seem magical?

634
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,250
Yes!

635
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,685
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

636
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,251
What did you call me?

637
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,010
Okay, okay. I'm out.

638
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,521
Whoa!

639
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,886
Bye-bye.

640
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,041
No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

641
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,964
But I did find us a place to sleep.

642
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,170
And it's free.

643
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,091
I'm sorry about this violence.

644
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,850
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

645
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,691
so we have good feelings.

646
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,530
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?

647
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,961
Uh...

648
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,484
Reindeers are better than people

649
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,443
Sven, don't you think that's true?

650
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,889
Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you

651
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,441
Every one of them's bad, except you

652
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,404
Aw. Thanks, buddy.

653
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,049
But people smell better than reindeers

654
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,365
Sven, don't you think I'm right?

655
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,767
That's once again true
For all, except you

656
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,210
You got me
Let's call it a night

657
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,009
Good night

658
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,725
Don't let the frostbite

659
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,201
Bite

660
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,445
Nice duet.

661
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,526
It's just you.
What do you want?

662
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,162
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.

663
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,090
I don't take people places.

664
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,485
Let me rephrase that.

665
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,005
Hey.

666
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,086
Take me up the North Mountain.

667
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,764
Please.

668
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,962
Look, I know how to stop this winter.

669
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,930
We leave at dawn.

670
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,522
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.

671
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,726
Oops, sorry.

672
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,087
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

673
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,807
We leave now. Right now.

674
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,086
Whew!

675
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,122
Hang on! We like to go fast.

676
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,601
I like fast.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

677
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,370
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

678
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,930
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

679
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,326
Ugh!

680
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,086
No, I was raised in a castle.
Hmm.

681
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,005
So, uh, tell me,

682
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,243
what made the queen go all ice-crazy?

683
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,481
Oh. Well...

684
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,240
It was all my fault.

685
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,847
I got engaged, but then she freaked out,

686
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,571
because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

687
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,570
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

688
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,162
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?

689
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,483
Yeah.
Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,

690
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,561
and then she tried to walk away,

691
00:40:54,615 --> 00:40:55,655
and I grabbed her glove...

692
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,681
Hang on!

693
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,729
You mean to tell me you got engaged

694
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,406
to someone you just met that day?

695
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,720
Yes. Pay attention.

696
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,930
But the thing is,
she wore the gloves all the time,

697
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,241
so I just thought,
maybe she has a thing about dirt.

698
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,284
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

699
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,769
Yes, they did.

700
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,561
But Hans is not a stranger.

701
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,650
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

702
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,206
Of the Southern Isles.

703
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,691
What's his favorite food?
Sandwiches.

704
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,131
Best friend's name?
Probably John.

705
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,247
Eye color?
Dreamy.

706
00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:26,855
Foot size?
Foot size doesn't matter.

707
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,086
Have you had a meal with him yet?

708
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,645
What if you hate the way he eats?

709
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,131
What if you hate
the way he picks his nose?

710
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,401
Picks his nose?

711
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,727
And eats it.

712
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,201
Excuse me, sir. He is a prince.

713
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,725
All men do it.
Ew.

714
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,210
Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love.

715
00:41:42,295 --> 00:41:43,575
It doesn't sound like true love.

716
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,126
Are you some
sort of love expert?

717
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,406
No. But, uh, I have friends who are.

718
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,960
You have friends

719
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,361
who are love experts? I'm not buying it.

720
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,930
Stop talking.
No, no, no. No, no.

721
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,840
I'd like to meet these...
No, I mean it.

722
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,761
Sven, go.

723
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,007
Go!

724
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,091
What are they?
Wolves.

725
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,327
Wolves?

726
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,211
What do we do?
I got this.

727
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,487
You just...
Don't fall off, and don't get eaten.

728
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,527
But I want to help!

729
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,647
No.
Why not?

730
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,721
Because I don't trust your judgment.

731
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,006
Excuse me?

732
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,844
Who marries a man she just met?

733
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,160
It's true love!

734
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,401
Whoa!

735
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,891
Whoa. Whoa!

736
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,485
Christopher!

737
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,051
It's Kristoff!

738
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,451
Ow!

739
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,807
Duck!

740
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,451
You almost set me on fire!

741
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,561
But I didn't.

742
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,446
Get ready to jump, Sven!

743
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,971
You don't tell him what to do.

744
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,445
Hey!
I do!

745
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,561
Jump, Sven!

746
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,721
Phew!

747
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,486
But I just paid it off.

748
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,644
Uh-oh. No. No.

749
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,247
No!

750
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,049
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

751
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,281
Grab on!

752
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,926
Pull, Sven. Pull!

753
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,890
Whoa.

754
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,288
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

755
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,881
And I understand
if you don't want to help me anymore.

756
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,046
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,

757
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,763
this whole thing has ruined me
for helping anyone ever again.

758
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,807
It's this way?

759
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,848
She'll die on her own.

760
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,684
I can live with that.
Here we go.

761
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,924
But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead.

762
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,531
I think, actually, it's up.

763
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:11,175
Sometimes, I really don't like you.

764
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,521
Hold up! We're coming.

765
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,127
You are?

766
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,283
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.

767
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,805
Arendelle.

768
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,528
It's completely frozen.

769
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,806
But it will be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

770
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,166
Will she?

771
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,844
Yeah. Now, come on.

772
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,684
This way to the North Mountain?

773
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,246
More like this way.

774
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,762
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

775
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,160
Yeah.

776
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,283
It really is beautiful, isn't it?

777
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,961
But it's so white.

778
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,210
You know, how about a little color?

779
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,649
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

780
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,245
How about yellow?

781
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,563
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?

782
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,211
No go.

783
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,530
Am I right?

784
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,961
Hi.
You're creepy.

785
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,326
Whoa!
I don't want it.

786
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,805
Back at you.
Please don't drop me.

787
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,086
No.
Come on, it's just a head.

788
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,400
All right. We got off to a bad start.

789
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,686
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

790
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,530
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

791
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,251
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

792
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,651
All right, wait one second.

793
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,131
Oh. Uh...

794
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,486
Oh!

795
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,925
Thank you.
You're welcome.

796
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,127
Now, I'm perfect.

797
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,686
Well, almost.

798
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,920
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

799
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,041
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

800
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:17,135
Head rush!
I was just... Are you okay?

801
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,482
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

802
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,330
I've always wanted a nose.

803
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:23,895
So cute.

804
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,604
It's like a little baby unicorn.

805
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,727
But... Hey! Whoa!

806
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,767
Oh.

807
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,649
I love it even more.

808
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,685
All right,
let's start this thing over.

809
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,967
Hi, everyone.

810
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,041
I'm Olaf.

811
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,326
And I like warm hugs.

812
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,881
Olaf?

813
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,009
That's right. Olaf.

814
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,208
And you are?

815
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,681
Oh. Um...

816
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,961
I'm Anna.

817
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,407
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

818
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,970
That's Sven.
Uh-huh.

819
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,929
And who's the reindeer?

820
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,967
Sven.

821
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,805
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things easier for me.

822
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,360
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.

823
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,483
I like you, too.
Olaf.

824
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,122
Did Elsa build you?
Yeah. Why?

825
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,441
Do you know where she is?

826
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,641
Fascinating.
Yeah. Why?

827
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,240
Do you think you could
show us the way?

828
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,281
Yeah. Why?

829
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,846
How does this work? Ow!

830
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,082
Stop it, Sven. I'm trying to focus, here.

831
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,162
Yeah. Why?
I'll tell you why.

832
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,245
We need Elsa to bring back summer.

833
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,250
Summer?
Mmm-hmm.

834
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,560
Oh. I don't know why,

835
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,326
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

836
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,882
And sun, and all things hot.

837
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,001
Really?

838
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,560
I'm guessing you
don't have much experience with heat.

839
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,721
Nope.

840
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,481
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,

841
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,406
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

842
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,849
Bees will buzz
Kids will blow dandelion fuzz

843
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,687
And I'll be doing
Whatever snow does in summer

844
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,567
A drink in my hand

845
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,961
My snow up against the burning sand

846
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,247
Probably getting gorgeously tanned

847
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,890
In summer

848
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,602
I'll finally see a summer breeze

849
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,728
Blow away a winter storm

850
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,007
And find out what happens
to solid water

851
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,811
When it gets warm

852
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,688
And I can't wait to see

853
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,643
What my buddies all think of me

854
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,521
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be

855
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,807
In summer!

856
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,368
The hot and the cold
are both so intense

857
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,847
Put them together
It just makes sense

858
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,368
Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle

859
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,323
But put me in summer and I'll be a...

860
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,324
Happy snowman!

861
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,526
When life gets rough

862
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,001
I like to hold on to my dream

863
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,007
Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam

864
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,245
Oh, the sky

865
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,885
Will be blue

866
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,324
And you guys will be there, too

867
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,400
When I finally do

868
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,768
What frozen things do
In summer!

869
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,484
I'm gonna tell him.
Don't you dare.

870
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,287
In summer!

871
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,281
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

872
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,489
Let's go bring back summer!

873
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,800
I'm coming!

874
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,125
Somebody's gotta tell him.

875
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,761
No, no. You've got the bark facing down.

876
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,365
The bark needs to be face-up.

877
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,967
Bark down is drier.
Bark up!

878
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,007
Bark down!
Papa!

879
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,684
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

880
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,804
Arendelle is indebted to you,
Your Highness.

881
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,286
The castle is open.

882
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,330
There is soup and hot glogg
in the great hall.

883
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,647
Here, pass these out.

884
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,085
Prince Hans!

885
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,726
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze

886
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,246
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?

887
00:50:00,775 --> 00:50:02,175
Princess Anna has given her orders.

888
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,929
And that's another thing!

889
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,526
Has it dawned on you
that your princess may be conspiring

890
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,726
with a wicked Sorceress

891
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,921
to destroy us all?

892
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,570
Do not question the princess.

893
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,211
She left me in charge

894
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,520
and I will not hesitate

895
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,125
to protect Arendelle from treason.

896
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,930
Treason?

897
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,447
Whoa! Whoa!

898
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,249
Whoa, boy. Easy.

899
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,401
Easy.

900
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,920
It's Princess Anna's horse.

901
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,525
So, where is the princess?

902
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
Where could she be?
Where is she?

903
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,405
Princess Anna is in trouble.

904
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,885
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

905
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,121
I'll go.
I volunteer.

906
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,168
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

907
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,091
Be prepared for anything.

908
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,442
And should you encounter the queen,

909
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,566
you are to put an end to this winter.

910
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,691
Do you understand?
Hmm.

911
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,805
So, how exactly
are you planning to stop this weather?

912
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,681
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.

913
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,121
That's your plan?

914
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,090
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

915
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,366
Yep.

916
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,485
So, you're not at all afraid of her?

917
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,490
Why would I be?
Yeah.

918
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,243
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

919
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,450
Oh. Look at that.

920
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,807
I've been impaled.

921
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,127
What now?

922
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,609
Mmm...

923
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,527
It's too steep.

924
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,046
I've only got one rope and you don't
know how to climb mountains.

925
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,406
Says who?

926
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,720
Hmm?

927
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,161
What are you doing?

928
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,246
I'm going to see my sister.

929
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,841
You're gonna kill yourself.

930
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,561
I wouldn't put my foot there.

931
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,290
You're distracting me.
Or there.

932
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,363
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

933
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,120
All right. I'm just blocking you out

934
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,851
because I gotta concentrate, here.

935
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,640
You know, most people who disappear

936
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,160
into the mountains want to be alone.

937
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,482
Nobody wants to be alone.

938
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,047
Except maybe you.

939
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,249
I'm not alone. I have friends, remember?

940
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,964
You mean, the love experts?

941
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,163
Yes, the love experts.

942
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,364
Ah...

943
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,690
Please tell me I'm almost there.

944
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,162
Does the air seem a bit thin
to you up here?

945
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,841
Hang on.

946
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,921
Hey, Sven?

947
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,929
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,

948
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,008
but I found a staircase that leads exactly

949
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,206
where you wanted to go.

950
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,203
Ha-ha! Thank goodness. Catch!

951
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,486
Thanks.
That was like a crazy trust exercise.

952
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,486
Whoa.

953
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,403
Now, that's ice.

954
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,526
I might cry.

955
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,171
Go ahead. I won't judge.

956
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,409
All right, take it easy, boy. Come here.

957
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,085
I got you.

958
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,927
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

959
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,206
Flawless.

960
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,481
Knock.

961
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,811
Just knock.

962
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,370
Why isn't she knocking?

963
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,765
Do you think she knows how to knock?

964
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,682
Huh. It opened.

965
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,046
That's a first.

966
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,246
Oh. You should probably wait out here.

967
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,288
What?
The last time I introduced her to a guy,

968
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,726
she froze everything.

969
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,643
But, but... Oh, come on!

970
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,485
It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life!

971
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,727
Bye, Sven.

972
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,370
You, too, Olaf.

973
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,529
Me?
Just give us a minute.

974
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,126
Okay.

975
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,890
One, two,

976
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,324
three...
Four...

977
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,881
Whoa.

978
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,161
Elsa?

979
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,043
It's me, Anna.

980
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,565
Anna.

981
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,762
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

982
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,890
It's a good different.

983
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,526
And this place...

984
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,166
It's amazing.

985
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,481
Thank you.

986
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,882
I never knew what I was capable of.

987
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,205
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...

988
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,406
No, no, no. It's okay.

989
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,690
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

990
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,607
Please.

991
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,841
But I just got here.

992
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,164
You belong down in Arendelle.

993
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,601
So do you.

994
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,808
No, Anna, I belong here.

995
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,001
Alone.

996
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,450
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

997
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,683
Actually, about that...

998
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,970
Sixty!
Wait. What is that?

999
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,126
Hi! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!

1000
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,967
Olaf?

1001
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,881
Yeah. You built me.

1002
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,641
Remember that?

1003
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,247
And you're alive?

1004
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,202
Um... I think so.

1005
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,286
He's just like the one we built as kids.

1006
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,646
Yeah.

1007
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,049
Elsa, we were so close.

1008
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,124
We can be like that again.

1009
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,280
Catch me!
Slow down!

1010
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,761
Anna!

1011
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,487
No.

1012
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,040
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

1013
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,281
Elsa, wait.

1014
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,408
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

1015
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,211
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

1016
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,883
Please don't shut me out again.

1017
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,242
Please don't slam the door

1018
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,211
You don't have to keep
Your distance anymore

1019
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,210
'Cause for the first time in forever

1020
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,489
I finally understand

1021
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,887
For the first time in forever

1022
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,167
We can fix this hand in hand

1023
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,208
We can head down
this mountain together.

1024
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,324
You don't have to live in fear

1025
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,161
'Cause for the first time in forever

1026
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,569
I Will be right here

1027
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,801
Anna.

1028
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,843
Please go back home

1029
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,490
Your life awaits

1030
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,928
Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates

1031
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,451
Yeah, but...
I know.

1032
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,650
You mean well
But leave me be

1033
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,285
Yes, I'm alone

1034
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,204
But I'm alone and free

1035
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,882
Just stay away
And you'll be safe from me

1036
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,121
Actually, we're not

1037
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:44,535
What do you mean, you're not?

1038
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,050
I get the feeling you don't know

1039
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,281
What do I not know?

1040
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,122
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep

1041
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,282
Deep snow

1042
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,641
What?

1043
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,602
You kind of set off
an eternal winter everywhere.

1044
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,001
Everywhere?

1045
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,889
Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

1046
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,128
No, I can't. I don't know how.

1047
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,681
Sure you can. I know you can.

1048
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,401
'Cause for the first time in forever

1049
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,247
Oh, I'm such a fool!
I can't be free!

1050
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,482
You don't have to be afraid

1051
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,564
No escape from the storm inside of me

1052
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,563
We can work this out together

1053
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,404
I can't control the curse!

1054
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,649
We'll reverse the storm you've made

1055
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,844
Anna, please you'll only make it worse!

1056
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,002
Don't panic
There's so much fear!

1057
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,565
We'll make the sun shine bright

1058
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,051
You're not safe here!

1059
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,770
We can face this thing together

1060
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,841
No!

1061
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,002
We can change this winter weather

1062
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,368
And everything will be all right

1063
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,361
I can't!

1064
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,041
Anna!

1065
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,801
Are you okay?

1066
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,206
I'm okay.

1067
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,520
I'm fine.

1068
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,881
Who's this?

1069
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,371
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...

1070
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,921
You have to go.

1071
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,685
No, I know we can
figure this out together.

1072
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,801
How?

1073
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,042
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1074
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,646
To stop me?

1075
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,285
Anna, I think we should go.

1076
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,249
No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

1077
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,044
Yes, you are.

1078
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,530
Stop! Put us down!

1079
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,204
Go away.

1080
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,165
Heads up!

1081
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,166
Watch out for my butt!

1082
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,685
It is not nice to throw people!

1083
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,922
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants.
Okay, relax.

1084
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,321
Just calm down! Calm down!
Okay! All right!

1085
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,004
I'm okay.
Just let the snowman be.

1086
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,241
I'm calm.
Great.

1087
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,925
Oh! Come on!

1088
00:58:53,175 --> 00:58:54,615
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.

1089
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,404
I'll distract him. You guys go.

1090
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,931
No, no! Not you guys!

1091
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,280
This just got
a whole lot harder.

1092
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,921
Look out!

1093
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,284
Run! Run!

1094
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,363
What are you doing?

1095
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,041
I got him!

1096
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,885
Whoa! Stop!

1097
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,041
It's a 100-foot drop.

1098
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,607
It's 200.

1099
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,121
Ow!

1100
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,848
What's that for?
I'm digging a snow anchor.

1101
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,490
Okay. What if we fall?

1102
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,800
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1103
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,604
It'll be like landing on a pillow.

1104
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,681
Hopefully.

1105
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,929
Okay, Anna. On three.

1106
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,286
Okay.
One...

1107
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,361
You tell me when. I'm ready to go.

1108
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,010
Two...
I was born ready! Yes!

1109
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,161
Calm down.

1110
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,281
Tree!

1111
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,561
What the... Whoa!

1112
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,204
That happened.

1113
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,249
Man, am I out of shape.

1114
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,249
There we go. Hey, Anna!

1115
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,084
Sven! Where did you guys go?

1116
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,811
We totally lost Marshmallow back there.

1117
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,681
Hey! We were just talking about you.

1118
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,808
All good things, all good things.

1119
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,321
No!

1120
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,845
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1121
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,521
Olaf!

1122
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,364
Hang in there, guys!

1123
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,687
Go. Go faster!

1124
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,410
Wait, what?
Hey!

1125
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,330
Ow!

1126
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,686
Kristoff!

1127
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,408
Don't come back!

1128
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,121
We won't.

1129
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,084
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

1130
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,486
Olaf!

1131
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,726
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!

1132
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,209
Those are my legs.
Ooh!

1133
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,725
Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

1134
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,769
Oh. That feels better.

1135
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,521
Hey, Sven! He found us.

1136
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,883
Who's my cute little reindeer?

1137
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,883
Don't talk to him like that.

1138
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,764
You're tickling me.

1139
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,881
Here.

1140
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,321
Whoa!

1141
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,526
Are you okay?

1142
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,965
Thank you.

1143
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,126
How's your head?
Ah! Ooh!

1144
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,160
It's fine. Uh...

1145
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,765
Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull.

1146
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,729
I don't have a skull.

1147
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,521
Or bones.

1148
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,241
So, uh... So, now what?

1149
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,524
Now what?

1150
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,886
Now what?

1151
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,081
Oh...

1152
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,640
What am I gonna do?

1153
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,571
She threw me out.

1154
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,927
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1155
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,001
And then there's your ice business.

1156
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,606
Hey, hey.
Don't worry about my ice business.

1157
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,484
Worry about your hair!
What?

1158
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,369
I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.

1159
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,965
No, yours is turning white.

1160
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,891
White? It's... What?

1161
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,082
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

1162
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,290
Does it look bad?

1163
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,731
No.
You hesitated.

1164
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,887
No, I didn't.

1165
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,288
Anna, you need help, okay? Come on.

1166
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,850
Okay! Where are we going?

1167
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,087
To see my friends.

1168
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,400
The love experts?

1169
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,130
Love experts?
Uh-huh.

1170
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,807
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.

1171
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,610
How do you know?

1172
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,323
Because I've seen them do it before.

1173
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,881
I like to consider myself a love expert.

1174
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,170
Get it together.

1175
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,211
Control it.

1176
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,964
Don't feel. Don't feel.

1177
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,090
Don't feel.

1178
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,924
Don't feel!

1179
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,007
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.

1180
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,169
Are you cold?
A little.

1181
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,683
Uh...
Wait. Come here.

1182
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,841
Huh?

1183
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,851
Ooh.

1184
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,528
So, uh, about my friends. Well...

1185
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,006
I say friends...

1186
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,128
They're more like family.

1187
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,010
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1188
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,089
Until they, you know, kinda took us in.

1189
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,965
They did?
Yeah.

1190
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,407
I don't want to scare you.

1191
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,804
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.

1192
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,285
Very loud.

1193
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,409
They are also stubborn at times,

1194
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,686
and a little overbearing.

1195
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,445
And heavy. Really, really, heavy.

1196
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,847
But you'll get it.
They mean well.

1197
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,048
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

1198
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,571
Okay, then.

1199
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,089
Meet my family.

1200
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,001
Hey, guys.

1201
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,050
They're rocks.

1202
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,527
You are a sight for sore eyes.

1203
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,331
He's crazy.

1204
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,088
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.

1205
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,647
Clay, whoa... I don't even recognize you.

1206
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,721
You lost so much weight.

1207
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,730
I'll distract him while you run.

1208
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,723
Hi, Sven's family!

1209
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,401
It's nice to meet you.

1210
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,161
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.

1211
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:27,131
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!

1212
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,090
Why aren't you running?

1213
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,526
Uh...

1214
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,887
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

1215
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,044
Go.
No, no, no. Anna, wait.

1216
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,090
Kristoff!

1217
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,044
Whoa!

1218
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,766
Hey!

1219
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,165
Kristoff's home!

1220
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,569
Kristoff's here!
Kristoff's home!

1221
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,927
Wait, Kristoff?
Uh-huh.

1222
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,531
Ah, let me look at you.

1223
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,204
Take off your clothes, I wash them.

1224
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,964
No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on.

1225
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,531
Look, it's great to see you all,

1226
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,726
but where's Granpabbie?

1227
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,887
He's napping.

1228
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,644
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1229
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,285
I...
I earned my fire crystal.

1230
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,600
I passed a kidney stone.

1231
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,966
Kristoff, pick me up.

1232
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,326
You're getting big.

1233
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,481
Good for you.

1234
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,168
Trolls. They're trolls!

1235
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,724
He's brought a girl!

1236
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,486
A girl!

1237
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,484
Whoa!
Is that a real girl?

1238
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,608
She's like a little cupcake.

1239
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,681
What's going on?

1240
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,886
I've learned to just roll with it.

1241
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,600
Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose,

1242
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,011
strong teeth!

1243
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,965
Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

1244
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,241
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.

1245
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,651
No.
You've got the wrong idea.

1246
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,801
No. That's not why I brought her here.

1247
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,689
Right. We're not... I'm not...

1248
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,762
What's the issue, dear?

1249
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,043
Why are you holding back
from such a man?

1250
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,929
Is it the clumpy way he walks?

1251
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,401
What?
Or the grumpy way he talks?

1252
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,240
Oh, no.
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped

1253
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,770
Weirdness of his feet?

1254
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,887
Hey!

1255
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,849
And though we know he washes well

1256
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,400
He always ends up sort of smelly

1257
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,130
But you'll never meet a fella

1258
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,089
Who's as sensitive and sweet

1259
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,207
That's nice, but...

1260
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,203
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

1261
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,322
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
So, he's got a few flaws

1262
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,561
Like his peculiar brain, dear

1263
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,721
His thing with the reindeer

1264
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,404
That's a little outside
of nature's laws

1265
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,527
This is not about me!

1266
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,284
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

1267
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,488
But this we're certain of

1268
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,131
You can fix this fixer-upper up

1269
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,929
With a little bit of love
Um...

1270
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,968
Can we please
just stop talking about this?

1271
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,202
We've got a real, actual problem, here.

1272
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,681
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...

1273
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,089
Is it the way that he runs scared?

1274
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,049
Or that he's socially impaired?

1275
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,603
Or that he only likes
To tinkle in the woods?

1276
01:06:33,654 --> 01:06:34,775
I did not need to know that.

1277
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,928
Are you holding back your fondness

1278
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,371
Due to his unmanly blondness?

1279
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,003
Or the way he covers up
That he's the honest goods?

1280
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,209
He's just a bit of a fixer-upper

1281
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,765
He's got a couple of bugs

1282
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,650
No, I don't!
His isolation is confirmation

1283
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,564
Of his desperation for healing hugs
Aw.

1284
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,210
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

1285
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,931
But we know what to do

1286
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,008
The way to fix up this fixer-upper

1287
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,570
Is to fix him up with you

1288
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,130
Whoa!

1289
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,765
Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough!

1290
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,966
She is engaged to someone else, okay?

1291
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,808
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper

1292
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,609
That's a minor thing

1293
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,082
Her quote engagement
Is a flex arrangement

1294
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,567
And by the way, I don't see no ring

1295
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,847
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper

1296
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,922
Hey! Whoa, watch it!
Her brain's a bit betwixt

1297
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,527
Get the fiancé out of the way

1298
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,921
And the whole thing will be fixed

1299
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,608
We're not saying you can change him

1300
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,649
'Cause people don't really change

1301
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,401
We're only saying that love's a force

1302
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,767
That's powerful and strange

1303
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,002
People make bad choices

1304
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,287
If they're mad or scared or stressed

1305
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,525
But throw a little love their way

1306
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,887
Throw a little love their way

1307
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,883
And you'll bring out their best

1308
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,288
True love brings out the best

1309
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,967
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper

1310
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,050
That's what it's all about

1311
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,121
Father!
Sister!

1312
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,931
Brother!
We need each other to raise us up

1313
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,161
And round us out

1314
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,689
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper

1315
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,162
But when push comes to shove

1316
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,486
The only fixer-upper fixer

1317
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,561
That can fix a fixer-upper is...

1318
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,962
True, true

1319
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,127
True

1320
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,201
Love!

1321
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,566
Love, love, love

1322
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,563
Love
True love

1323
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,721
True

1324
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,930
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff
to be your trollfully wedded...

1325
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,889
Wait, what?
You're getting married.

1326
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,041
Love!

1327
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,201
Anna?

1328
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,406
She's as cold as ice.

1329
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,770
There is strange magic here.

1330
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,163
Granpabbie.
Come, come. Bring her here to me.

1331
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,325
Anna, your life is in danger.

1332
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,924
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.

1333
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,248
If not removed,
to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

1334
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,966
What? No.

1335
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,326
But you can remove it, right?

1336
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,527
I cannot.

1337
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,489
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

1338
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,087
If it was her head, that would be easy.

1339
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:09,001
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.

1340
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,405
An act of true love?

1341
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,767
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1342
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,007
Something's wrong.
Are you all right?

1343
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,606
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

1344
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,727
Hans.

1345
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,801
Pull us out, Sven.

1346
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,966
Olaf, come on!

1347
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,685
I'm coming!

1348
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,963
Let's go kiss Hans!

1349
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,084
Who is this Hans?

1350
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,089
We are here to find Princess Anna.

1351
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,042
Be on guard,
but no harm is to come to the queen.

1352
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,601
Do you understand?

1353
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,521
Yes, Your Grace.

1354
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,091
The queen.

1355
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,168
Go, go! Come on!

1356
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,487
There!

1357
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,167
Up there!

1358
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,925
Come on!

1359
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,681
We got her.

1360
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,520
No. Please.

1361
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,130
Go around. Toss it.

1362
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,486
Stay away!

1363
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,926
Look out!

1364
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,570
Fire! Fire!

1365
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,846
Get her!

1366
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,921
Ah!

1367
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,526
Come on!

1368
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,607
Grab his arm.

1369
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,041
Aim...

1370
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:47,015
This way, this way!

1371
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,041
Whoa!

1372
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,447
Queen Elsa!

1373
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,361
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

1374
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,527
Oh, no. What have... What have I done?

1375
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,091
Why did you bring me here?

1376
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,085
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1377
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,369
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.

1378
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,922
Anna has not returned.

1379
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,648
If you would just stop the winter.

1380
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,446
Bring back summer, please.

1381
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,245
Don't you see?

1382
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,880
I can't.

1383
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,881
You have to tell them to let me go.

1384
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,489
I will do what I can.

1385
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,720
Just hang in there.

1386
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,961
Come on, buddy, faster!

1387
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,081
Oh, boy!

1388
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,162
Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle!

1389
01:13:57,414 --> 01:13:58,775
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

1390
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,325
I will!

1391
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,761
Hello!
It's alive!

1392
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,325
It's Princess Anna!

1393
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,569
Are you gonna be okay?

1394
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,409
Don't worry about me.

1395
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,244
Anna!

1396
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,163
You had us worried sick.
My Lady.

1397
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,164
Get her warm.
And find Prince Hans, immediately.

1398
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,651
We will. Thank you.

1399
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,331
Make sure she's safe.

1400
01:14:38,815 --> 01:14:40,455
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.

1401
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,689
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.

1402
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,089
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.

1403
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,850
You cannot risk going out there again.

1404
01:15:01,215 --> 01:15:02,375
If anything happens to her...

1405
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,164
If anything happens to the princess,

1406
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,727
you are all Arendelle has left.

1407
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,249
He's in here.

1408
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,367
Prince Hans.

1409
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,726
Anna.

1410
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:13,927
You're so cold.

1411
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,161
Hans, you have to kiss me.
What?

1412
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,890
Now! Now!
Slow down.

1413
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,689
We'll give you two some privacy.

1414
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,766
What happened out there?

1415
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,729
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1416
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,405
You said she would never hurt you.

1417
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,481
I was wrong.

1418
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,925
Anna.

1419
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,290
She froze my heart,

1420
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,966
and only an act of true love can save me.

1421
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,404
A true love's kiss.

1422
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,760
Oh, Anna.

1423
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,250
If only there was
someone out there who loved you.

1424
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,600
What?

1425
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,884
You said you did.

1426
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,925
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,

1427
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,206
I didn't stand a chance.

1428
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,966
I knew I would have to marry
into the throne somewhere.

1429
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,440
What... What are you talking about?

1430
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,367
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

1431
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,529
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1432
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,641
But you...
Hans!

1433
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,165
You were so desperate for love,

1434
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,971
you were willing
to marry me just like that.

1435
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,329
I figured after we married,

1436
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,408
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.

1437
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,648
Hans!
No. Stop.

1438
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,888
But then, she doomed herself,

1439
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,849
and you were dumb enough
to go after her.

1440
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,967
Please.

1441
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,520
All that's left now is to kill Elsa,

1442
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,571
and bring back summer.

1443
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,168
You're no match for Elsa.

1444
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,447
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1445
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,281
I, on the other hand,

1446
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:50,329
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.

1447
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,611
You won't get away with this.

1448
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,207
Oh...

1449
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,411
I already have.

1450
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,924
Please, somebody, help.

1451
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,723
Please. Please.

1452
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,729
It's getting colder by the minute.

1453
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,441
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1454
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,931
Prince Hans.

1455
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,043
Princess Anna is...

1456
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,967
Dead.

1457
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,080
What?

1458
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,610
What happened to her?

1459
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,050
She was killed.

1460
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,760
By Queen Elsa.

1461
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,927
No!

1462
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,281
Her own sister.

1463
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,567
At least we got to say our marriage vows

1464
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,882
before she died in my arms.

1465
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,330
There can be no doubt now.

1466
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,125
Queen Elsa is a monster,

1467
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,123
and we are all in grave danger.

1468
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,521
Prince Hans,

1469
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,083
Arendelle looks to you.

1470
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,444
With a heavy heart,

1471
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,491
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.

1472
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,568
And sentence her to death.

1473
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,081
Hurry up!

1474
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,361
She's dangerous.

1475
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,840
Move quickly.
Careful.

1476
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,850
It won't open!
It's frozen shut.

1477
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,320
Put your back into it!

1478
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,010
Come on! Push!

1479
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,281
What is it, buddy?

1480
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,805
Hey, watch it.

1481
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,361
What's wrong with you?

1482
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,882
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1483
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,807
Stop it! Put me down!

1484
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,326
No, Sven!

1485
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,965
We're not going back.

1486
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,530
She's with her true love.

1487
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,521
What the...

1488
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,441
Anna!

1489
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,285
Come on! Come on, boy.

1490
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,481
Help.

1491
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,125
Anna!

1492
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,280
Oh, no.

1493
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,681
Olaf?

1494
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,082
Olaf. Get away from there.

1495
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,761
Wow!

1496
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,607
So, this is heat.

1497
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,051
I love it.

1498
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,810
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1499
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,044
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?

1500
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,406
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1501
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,325
But we ran all the way here.

1502
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,962
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here.
You'll melt.

1503
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,121
I am not leaving here until

1504
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,731
we find some other act
of true love to save you.

1505
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,969
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1506
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,010
I don't even know what love is.

1507
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,084
That's okay, I do.

1508
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,885
Love is

1509
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,247
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1510
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,811
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you
back here to Hans and left you forever.

1511
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,129
Kristoff loves me?

1512
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,207
Wow, you really
don't know anything about love, do you?

1513
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,524
Olaf, you're melting.

1514
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,002
Some people are worth melting for.

1515
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,242
Just maybe not right this second.

1516
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,886
Don't worry, I've got it.

1517
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,523
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.

1518
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,290
Hang on, I'm getting something.

1519
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,801
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1520
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,166
They're coming back this way.

1521
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,961
They... They are?

1522
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,760
Wow! He's really moving fast.

1523
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,366
I guess I was wrong.

1524
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,840
I guess Kristoff doesn't
love you enough to leave you behind.

1525
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,563
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1526
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,723
No, no, no! You need to
stay by the fire and keep warm.

1527
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,484
I need to get to Kristoff.

1528
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,641
Why?

1529
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,566
Oh, I know why!

1530
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,888
There's your act of true love right there!

1531
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,885
Riding across the fjords
like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!

1532
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,246
Come on!

1533
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,245
Look out!

1534
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,520
Oh!

1535
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,970
Uh... Back this way.

1536
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,850
We're trapped.

1537
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,480
Oh...

1538
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,010
Whoa!

1539
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,730
Slide, Anna!

1540
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,171
We made it!

1541
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,930
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1542
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,170
Come on, buddy, faster.

1543
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,011
Kristoff!

1544
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,245
Keep going!

1545
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,085
Kristoff!

1546
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,767
Come on!

1547
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,167
No.

1548
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,441
Whoa!

1549
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,650
Whoa!

1550
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,610
Sven... Sven!

1551
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,565
Good boy.

1552
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,371
Kristoff.

1553
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,209
Kristoff...
Anna...

1554
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,201
Anna!

1555
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,969
Elsa! You can't run from this!

1556
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,289
Just take care of my sister.

1557
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,885
Your sister?

1558
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,526
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1559
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,968
She said that you froze her heart.

1560
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,041
No.

1561
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,248
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

1562
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,041
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

1563
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,170
Your sister is dead.

1564
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,604
Because of you.

1565
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,847
No.

1566
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,121
Kristoff.

1567
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,050
Anna!

1568
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,005
Elsa?

1569
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,407
No!

1570
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,001
Anna!

1571
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,450
Oh. Anna!

1572
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,402
No, no!

1573
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,045
Please, no.

1574
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,801
Anna?

1575
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,810
Anna?

1576
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,480
Oh, Elsa.

1577
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,007
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1578
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,171
I love you.

1579
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:50,042
An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart.

1580
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,290
Love will thaw.

1581
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,160
Love. Of course.

1582
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,321
Elsa?

1583
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,041
Love!

1584
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,291
I knew you could do it.

1585
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,042
Hands down,
this is the best day of my life.

1586
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,489
And, quite possibly, the last.

1587
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,881
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

1588
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,850
Oh, oh, oh!

1589
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,043
My own personal flurry!

1590
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,370
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1591
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,441
Anna?

1592
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,444
But she froze your heart.

1593
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,371
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1594
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,324
Wonderful!

1595
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,805
Setting course, sir.

1596
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,447
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

1597
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:50,361
We shall see what his 12 big
brothers think of his behavior.

1598
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,205
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1599
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,930
This is unacceptable.

1600
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,124
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1601
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,964
Ah! My neck hurts.

1602
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,728
Is there a doctor that I could see?

1603
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,161
And I demand to see the queen!

1604
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,242
Oh. I have a message from the queen.

1605
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,644
Arendelle will henceforth and forever

1606
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:13,645
no longer do business
of any sort with Weaseltown.

1607
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,961
Weselton.

1608
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,530
It's Weselton!
Let's go.

1609
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,640
Come on, come on, come on!

1610
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,131
Okay, okay, here I come.

1611
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,089
Pole!
Whoops! Sorry.

1612
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,811
Okay, okay.

1613
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,644
Here we are. Oh!

1614
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,963
I owe you a sled.

1615
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,804
Are you serious?
Yes!

1616
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,730
And it's the latest model.

1617
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,325
No, I can't accept this.

1618
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,165
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1619
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:45,121
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1620
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,249
What? That's not a thing.
Oh, sure it is.

1621
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:50,767
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1622
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,081
Like it? I love it!

1623
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:54,161
Whoa.

1624
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,890
I could kiss you!

1625
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,529
I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd...

1626
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,728
May I? We me.
I mean, may we?

1627
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,927
Wait, what?

1628
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,166
We may.

1629
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,489
Mmm.

1630
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,526
Summer!

1631
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,527
Ooh...

1632
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,602
Hello.

1633
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:32,961
Are you ready?

1634
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,882
Ice!

1635
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,204
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1636
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,725
Swing me.

1637
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,404
Ooh...

1638
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,484
I like the open gates.

1639
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,722
We are never closing them again.

1640
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,727
Oh, Elsa, they're beaut iful,
but you know I don't skate.

1641
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,331
Come on! You can do it!

1642
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,081
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.

1643
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:12,844
I got it, I got it. I don't got it, I don't got it.

1644
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:13,921
Hey, guys!

1645
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,240
That's it, Olaf.

1646
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,563
Glide and pivot. And glide and pivot.

1647
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,085
Go.

1648
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,001
Oh!

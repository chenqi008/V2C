1
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,929
Buzz lightyear mission log.

2
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,974
All signs point to this planet
as the location of zurg's fortress,

3
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,849
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

4
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,742
Come to me, my prey.

5
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,743
To infinity and beyond!

6
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,594
So, we meet again,
buzz lightyear, for the last time.

7
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,016
Not today, zurg!

8
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,572
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, you almost had him.

9
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,745
- I'm never gonna defeat zurg!
- Sure, you will, Rex.

10
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,355
In fact, you're a better buzz than I am.

11
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,960
But look at my little arms!

12
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:02,132
I can't press the "fire" button
and jump at the same time!

13
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,251
Where 1s it? Where is it?

14
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,550
- Woody?
- Huh?

15
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,803
Both: Ooh.

16
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,555
Hang on, cowboy!

17
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,642
- Woody, are you all right?
- Oh. Yeah.

18
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,479
Yeah, I'm fine, buzz. Okay. Here's your
list of things to do while I'm gone.

19
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,858
Batteries need to be changed.

20
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,928
Toys in the bottom of the chest
need to be rotated.

21
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,318
Oh, and make sure everyone
attends Mr. spell's seminar

22
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,412
on what to do
if you or a part of you is swallowed.

23
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,117
Okay? Okay. Good. Okay.

24
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,290
Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?

25
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,993
No! And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,

26
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,328
and I can't find it anywhere!

27
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,413
Don't worry, Woody.
In just a few hours,

28
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:46,252
you'll be sitting around a campfire with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."

29
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,008
- They're called s'mores, buzz.
- Right. Right. Of course.

30
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,181
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?

31
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,931
Sergeant: Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.

32
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,390
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.

33
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,444
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.

34
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,192
- I found it.
- You found my hat?

35
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,491
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.

36
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:13,287
- Oh, my little sweet potato!
- Oh, you found it!

37
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,659
Oh, it's so nice

38
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,288
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.

39
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,870
- Ooh!
- Oh, great. That's just great.

40
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,082
This'll be the first year I miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!

41
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,417
- Woody, look under your boot.
- Don't be silly.

42
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,549
- My hat is not under my boot.
- Would you just look?

43
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,882
No hat. Just the word "Andy."

44
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,184
Uh-huh. And the boy who wrote that

45
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,638
would take you to camp
with or without your hat.

46
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,394
I'm sorry, Bo.

47
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,272
It's just that I've been
lookin' forward to this all year.

48
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,604
It's my one time
with just me and Andy.

49
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,610
You're cute when you care.

50
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,785
- Bo, not in front of buzz.
- Let him look.

51
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,615
Miss peep, your sheep!

52
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,084
This is al from al's toy barn,

53
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,566
and I'm sittin' on good deals.
“Whoa!

54
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,377
Ow! I think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.

55
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,336
Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got
boats for a buck, beanies for a buck...

56
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,842
- Turn it offt someone's gonna hear!
- Which one is off?

57
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,140
Buck, buck, buck!
And that's cheap, cheap, cheap!

58
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,341
So hurry on down...

59
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,836
For cryin' out loud, it's this one.

60
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,643
- I despise that chicken.
- Fellas! Fellas!

61
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,897
Okay, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

62
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,568
What news?

63
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,897
The good news is
I found your hat, Woody.

64
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,575
My hat! Slink, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

65
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,369
- Where'd you find it?
- Well, that's the bad news.

66
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,288
Oh, it's buster!

67
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,117
Sergeant: Canine alert!
Man your battle stations!

68
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,794
Let's move, move, move!

69
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,463
Woody! Hide! Quick!

70
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,147
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay! You found me!

71
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,981
Buster, all right.

72
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,532
Hey, how did he do, hamm?

73
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,237
- Looks like a new record.
- Okay, boy. Sit.

74
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,788
Reach for the sky.

75
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,911
Gotcha!

76
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,790
Great job, boy.

77
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,292
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?

78
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,383
Who's gonna miss me?

79
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,549
Who's gonna miss me?

80
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,172
Woman: Andy, you got all your stuff?

81
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,074
Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.

82
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,884
It's in my room.

83
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,560
Stick 'em up.

84
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,020
I guess we'll work on that later.

85
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,224
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?

86
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,606
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin'.

87
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,609
Five minutes. Hmm.

88
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,108
Help, help! Somebody help me!

89
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,238
Let her go, evil Dr. pork chop!

90
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,695
Andy: Never!

91
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,532
You must choose, sheriff Woody.
How shall she die?

92
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:08,541
Shark, or death by monkeys?

93
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,791
Choose!

94
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,124
Andy: I choose buzz lightyear!

95
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,425
What? That's not a choice!

96
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,628
Andy: To infinity and beyond!

97
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,764
- I'll save you, miss peep.
- My hero.

98
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,332
- Andy: Thanks, buzz.
- Andy: No problem, buddy.

99
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,312
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo

100
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,891
of Woody and buzz lightyear!

101
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,647
Oh, no.

102
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,364
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.

103
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,943
- But, mom, Woody's arm ripped.
- Oh, no.

104
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,747
- Maybe we can fix him on the way.
- No, just leave him.

105
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:48,619
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.

106
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,883
- What happened?
- Woody's been shelved.

107
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,152
Andy!

108
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,540
Slinky: Woody?

109
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,588
Bo peep: Woody?
Honey, are you okay?

110
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,232
Andy: Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!

111
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,273
He's back?
Hey, everybody! Andy's back!

112
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,823
He's back early from cowboy camp!

113
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,862
Places, everybody! Andy's coming!

114
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:05,956
Yeah!

115
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,747
Hey, Woody! Did you miss me?

116
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,499
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!

117
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,759
Ohh. I forgot. You're broken.

118
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,047
I don't wanna play with you anymore.

119
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,826
No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No!

120
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,872
Andy. Andy.

121
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,908
Bye, Woody.

122
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:11,144
Woody: Wheezy, is that you?

123
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,563
- Hey, Woody.
- What are you doing up here?

124
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,813
I thought mom took you
to get your squeaker fixed months ago.

125
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,189
- Andy was so upset.
- Nah.

126
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,362
She just told him that
to calm him down

127
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,440
and then put me on the shelf.

128
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,822
- Why didn't you yell for help?
- Well, I tried squeakin'.

129
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,997
- But I'm still broken.
- No one could hear me.

130
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:36,374
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.

131
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,544
What's the point
in prolonging the inevitable?

132
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:47,677
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.

133
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,885
Yard sale? Yard sale!

134
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,064
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!

135
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,186
- Yard sale?
- Sarge, emergency roll call!

136
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,269
Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!

137
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:04,572
All civilians fall in position now!
Single file! Let's move, move, move!

138
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,659
- Hamm?
- Here.

139
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,263
- Potato head, Mr. and Mrs.?
- Both: Here.

140
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,073
Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.

141
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,994
I hate yard sales!

142
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,538
Someone's coming!

143
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,587
Okay. Let's see what's up here.

144
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,108
Bye, Woody.

145
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,941
Wheezy! Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

146
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,278
Ooh...

147
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,454
Hey. Here, boy. Here, buster!

148
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,375
Up here! No, no, no, no, no, no!

149
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,370
Okay, boy. To the yard sale! Hyah!

150
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,358
Potato head:
What's goin' on? He's nuts.

151
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,463
His arm ain't that bad.

152
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,837
Don't do it, Woody! We love you!

153
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,196
Okay, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.

154
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,571
Woody: Not that casual.

155
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,398
Hamm: Piggy bank coming through,
coming through.

156
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,879
Rex: Is he out there?
Buzz: There he is.

157
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,913
Rex: He's getting in the box!

158
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,144
Hamm: He's sellin' himself
for 25 cents!

159
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,846
Woody, you're worth more than that.

160
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,307
Buzz: Hold on. Hold on.
He's got something.

161
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,017
- It's wheezy!
- All: Wheezy?

162
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,149
Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue.

163
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,031
Good boy, buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.

164
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,704
- Bless you, Woody.
- All right, now.

165
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,406
Back to Andy's room. Hyah!

166
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,038
Buzz: Way to go, cowboy.

167
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,872
- Slinky: Golly Bob howdy!
- Woody, I'm slipping!

168
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,255
Mommy... mommy, look! Look at this!

169
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,808
- Mommy, look! It's a cowboy Dolly!
- Hey, that's not her toy!

170
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,790
Slinky: What's that little gal
think she's doin'?

171
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,601
Mommy, mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?

172
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,058
Oh, honey. You don't want
that toy. It's broken.

173
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,485
Voice box:
There's a snake in my boot.

174
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,781
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!

175
00:15:55,872 --> 00:16:00,787
Little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...

176
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,493
A hat! I found him!

177
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,044
I found him! I found him!

178
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,923
Andy's mother: Buster! Quiet down!

179
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,841
Excuse me. Can I help you? Yes.

180
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,135
You can help take his paws off my pal.

181
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,804
I'll give you 50 cents
for all this junk.

182
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,537
- Oh, now, how did this get down here?
- Buzz: Hand her the sheriff.

183
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,142
Nice and easy.

184
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,937
- $s.
- I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.

185
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,606
Now just walk away.

186
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,103
- Walit.
- The other way.

187
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,609
- Mother: It's not for sale.
- Everything's for sale.

188
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,362
- Or trade. You like my watch?
- Sorry.

189
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:39,366
- He's safe. Way to go Andy's mom!
- She showed him!

190
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,560
Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.

191
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,166
Potato head:
Yeah. Go home, Mr. fancy car.

192
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,836
Buzz: Hold on. Hamm: What's up?

193
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,629
Rex: What is it, buzz?

194
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,711
Toys: What's happening?

195
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,802
What's he doing?

196
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,674
I can't watch!
Can someone cover my eyes?

197
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,381
Buzz: He's stealin' Woody!
Rex: What? He can't take Woody.

198
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,511
It's illegal.

199
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,342
- Where's he going?
- Do something.

200
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,677
Bo peep: Buzz!

201
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,558
"Potato head: Get him, buzz.

202
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,399
Where's the red jacket?

203
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,513
Why would someone steal Woody?

204
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,221
All right.
Let's review this one more time.

205
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,728
At precisely 8:32-ish,

206
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,855
exhibit a, Woody, was kidnapped.

207
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,313
Exhibit b,
a composite sketch of the kidnapper.

208
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,784
- He didn't have a beard like that.
- Fine. Etch, give him a shave.

209
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,593
Slinky: The kidnapper
was bigger than that.

210
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,707
- Oh, picky, picky, picky.
- Let's just go straight to exhibit f.

211
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,454
The kidnapper's vehicle.

212
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,398
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.

213
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,629
Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.

214
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,751
Hey. Put a cork in it.

215
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,083
- How do you spell FBI?
- My crime scene!

216
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,298
Oh, why don't you watch
where you're going, godspilla?

217
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,050
- I didn't know there was a crime scene.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

218
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,383
- A little quiet, please. Thank you.
- Huh?

219
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,225
Mr. spell: Lazy toy brain.

220
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,442
- Lousy try, Brian.
- What are you doing, buzz?

221
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,487
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's I.D. Tag.

222
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,781
- Liz try bran.
- It's just a license plate.

223
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,679
- It's just a jumble of letters.
- Yeah, and there are about

224
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,537
3.5 million registered cars
in the tri-county area alone.

225
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,456
Lou's thigh burn.

226
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,377
Oh, this can't help.
Let's leave buzz to play with his toys.

227
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,714
Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on!

228
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,550
- Al's toy bam.
- Al's toy barn!

229
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,720
Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.

230
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,642
It's the chicken man!

231
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,273
Buzz: That's our guy.

232
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,443
I knew there was something
I didn't like about that chicken.

233
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,486
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

234
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,968
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,

235
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,859
because I am in the middle
of something really important.

236
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,654
You, my little cowboy friend,

237
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,412
are gonna make me
big buck, buck, bucks.

238
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,821
Andy!

239
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,745
I can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.

240
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,163
All the way to work!

241
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,303
What? Whoa!

242
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,476
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy!

243
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,562
Stop it! Sit, I said!

244
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,530
Whoa! Whoa.

245
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,906
Yee-haw!

246
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,160
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!

247
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,866
It's really you! “What's me?

248
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,035
\whoo-whee!

249
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,745
Voice box:
There's a snake in my boot.

250
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,206
- Ha! It is you!
- Please stop saying that.

251
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,838
Prospector said someday you'd come.

252
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,794
Sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln!

253
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,347
The prospector!
He'll wanna meet ya!

254
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,266
Say "hello" to the prospector!

255
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,437
- It... it's a box.
- He's mint in the box.

256
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,363
Never been opened.

257
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,364
Pete: Turn me around, bullseye,
so I can see.

258
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,157
Why, the prodigal son has returned.

259
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,200
Yee-haw!

260
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,501
It's you! It's you!

261
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,295
You're here!
It's you! It's you! It's you!

262
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,795
Okay. I'm officially freaked out now.

263
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,878
Oh, we've waited countless years
for this day.

264
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,465
- It's good to see you, Woody.
- Listen. I don't know...

265
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,304
- Hey, how do you know my name?
- Everyone knows your name, wood-y.

266
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:43,522
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? Bullseye?

267
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,751
That's me.

268
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,438
Wow.

269
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,945
Holy cow.

270
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,327
Announcer: Cowboy crunchies,

271
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,955
the cereal that's sugar-frosted
and dipped in chocolate,

272
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,456

275
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,592

277
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,888
J bullseye, he's Woody's horse

278
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,515
js he's a smart one

279
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,551
j Pete the old prospector

280
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,011
has anyone seen my pick?

281
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,472
J and the man himself
of course, it's time for sheriff Woody

282
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,812
j he's the very best

283

284

j in the wild, wild west

285
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:14,617
j Woody's roundup &

286
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:20,031
I can't find it! It doesn't seem
to be on any of these stations.

287
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,740
- Keep looking.
- You're going too slow.

288
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,450
Let me take the wheel.

289
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,543
Rex: It's too fast.

290
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,168
- How can you even tell what's on?
- I can tell.

291
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,167
All: Stop! Back, back, back!

292
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,094
- All: Back, back! Stop!
- And look for the giant chicken!

293
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,185
Now, etch!

294
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,062
That's where I need to go.

295
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,606
You can't go, buzz.
You'll never make it there.

296
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,980
Woody once risked his life to save me.

297
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:53,405
I couldn't call myself his friend
if I weren't willing to do the same.

298
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,028
So who's with me?

299
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:00,785
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

300
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,618
This is for Woody when you find him.

301
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,630
All right,

302
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,174
but I don't think it'll mean
the same coming from me.

303
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:17,221
Mr. buzz lightyear,
you just gotta save my pal Woody.

304
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,344
I'll do my best, son.

305
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,431
Okay, fellas. Let's roll.

306
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,028
Geronimo!

307
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,026
You'd think with
all my video game experience,

308
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,153
I'd be feeling more prepared.

309
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,245
The idea is to let go.

310
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,248
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

311
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,619
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!

312
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,709
To al's toy barn and beyond!

313
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,415
TV Jessie: They don't call this

314
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,521
the old abandoned mine
for nothin', prospector.

315
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,348
I reckon we oughta get outta here.

316
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:13,186
TV Pete: Where's my gold?
Hold on. I'll light me a candle.

317
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,111
This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.

318
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,111
Blast us to smithereens!
That there's dynamite!

319
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,614
- Holy tarnation.
- I'll call for help.

320
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,283
J yodel-ay-hee-hoo j

321
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,581
hey, critters, go get sheriff Woody.
Now scurry!

322
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,189
TV Woody: Good job, bullseye.

323
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,420
I reckon the new schoolhouse
is finally done.

324
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,543
What's that?

325
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,653
Jessie and prospector are trapped
in the old abandoned mine,

326
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,031
and prospector just lit a stick
of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle,

327
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,975
and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?

328
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,057
Rabbit: Mmm-hmm.

329
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,632
Ride like the wind, bullseye!

330
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:51,557
You're fannin' the flames, Jessie!
It takes brains to put out that fire.

331
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,018
Yow! My biscuits are burnin'!

332
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,488
Announcer: Will Woody
and bullseye land to safety?

333
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,864
Can they reach Jessie
and stinky Pete in time?

334
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:08,332
Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion, "Woody's finest hour."

335
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,830
All right! All right! Next tape!

336
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,795
Hey, wait.
What happened? What happens next?

337
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,669
- Come on! Let's see the next episode!
- Pete: That's it.

338
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,877
- What?
- The show was canceled after that.

339
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,925
Wait. What about the gold mine

340
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,382
and the cute little critters
and the dynamite?

341
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,264
That was a great show!
I mean, why cancel it?

342
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,767
Two words, sput-Nik.

343
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,727
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.

344
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,313
I know how that feels.
But, still, my own show.

345
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,899
- I mean, look at all this stuff!
- Jessie: Didn't you know?

346
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,447
Why, you're valuable property!

347
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,621
I wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

348
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,415
I'm on a yo-yo.

349
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,791
Oh, hey. Nice teeth.
And yet still a good-lookin' guy.

350
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,467
Oh, it's a bank! Cool.

351
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,758
What do you do?
You push the hat, and out...

352
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,137
Oh, out come bubbles. Clever.

353
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,718
Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do?

354
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,476
I get it.

355
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,558
"There's a snake in my boot."

356
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,110
Oh, hey, bullseye.
Go long! Go long! Whoo!

357
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,694
A record player!

358
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,776
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

359
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,618
Okay, now. Slow.

360
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,667
Oh, that's funny, bullseye.

361
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,458
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

362
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,630
Jessie: Oh.

363
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,301
Not bad.

364
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,125
J it's time for Woody's roundup

365
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,132
- whee!
- J' he's the very best

366
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,556
j he's the roolin-est
tootin'-est cowboy... 

367
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,847
look at us! We're a complete set!

368
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,021
- Now it's on to the museum.
- Museum?

369
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,733
- What museum?
- Pete: The museum.

370
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,813
We're being sold
to the konishi toy museum in Tokyo.

371
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,115
- That's in Japan!
- Japan?

372
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,784
No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan.

373
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,203
What do you mean?

374
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,033
I got to get back home to
my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See?

375
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,085
- He still has an owner.
- Oh, my goodness.

376
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,505
No. Can't go.

377
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,337
I can't do storage again. I just can't!

378
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,589
- Jessie. Jessie.
- I won't go back in the dark!

379
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,659
What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?

380
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,550
Well, we've been in storage
for a long time

381
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:31,679
waiting for you.

382
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,052
- Why me?
- The museum's

383
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,355
only interested in the collection
if you're in it, Woody.

384
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,688
Without you, we go back into storage.

385
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,820
- It's that simple.
- It's not fair!

386
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,272
How can you do this to us?

387
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,200
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.

388
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,404
You see, I was in this yard sale...
Yard sale?

389
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,705
Why were you in a yard sale
if you have an owner?

390
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,771
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
I was trying to save another toy when...

391
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,458
Was it because you're damaged?
Hmm? Did this Andy break you?

392
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,425
Yeah, but... no, no, no, no, no!
It was... it was an accident.

393
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,093
- I mean...
- Sounds like he really loves you.

394
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,048
It's not like that, okay?
And I'm not going to any museum!

395
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,976
Well, I'm not going back into storage!

396
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,098
Pete: Al's coming!

397
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,646
Go! Go on, Jessie.

398
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,190
- Oh...
- Jessie, look at me.

399
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:24,148
I promise you'll come out of the box.
Now go! Go!

400
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,699
It's show time!

401
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,949
Oh, money, baby.
Money, money, money.

402
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:39,994
And now

403
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,703
the main attraction.

404
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,763
No! His arm! Where's his arm?

405
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,764
Oh... no. No, no, no, no!

406
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,520
What am I gonna do? I know. I know.

407
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:06,229
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!

408
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,779
- Man: Hello?
- It's me. It's al.

409
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,026
I got an emergency.

410
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,823
- I'm busy.
- Yes, we're all busy.

411
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,744
Look. It has to be tonight.

412
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,071
All right. All right.
But first thing in the morning.

413
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,145
It's gone! I can't believe it!

414
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,689
- My arm is completely gone!
- All right. Come here. Let me see that.

415
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,045
Oh, it's just a popped seam,

416
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,247
easily repaired.

417
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,378
- You should consider yourself lucky.
- Lucky?

418
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,586
Are you shrink-wrapped?
I am missing my arm!

419
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,011
Big deal.

420
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,388
Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy

421
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,812
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.

422
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:45,101
Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.

423
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:48,733
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.

424
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,212
All right.
Nobody look till I get my cork back in.

425
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,674
Good work, men. Two blocks down
and only 19 more to go.

426
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,975
What? All: Nineteen?

427
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,553
Are we gonna do this all night?
My parts are killing me.

428
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,728
Come on, fellas.

429
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,183
Did Woody give up when sid
had me strapped to a rocket?

430
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,893
- All: No.
- No.

431
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,900
And did he give up when you threw him
out of the back of that moving Van?

432
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,323
- Oh, you had to bring that up.
- No, he didn't!

433
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:38,745
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

434
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,912
Now let's move out!

435
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,418
Announcer: And that concludes
our broadcast day.

436
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,970
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.

437
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,577
Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.

438
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,185
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember? Just go.

439
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,308
Bullseye...
All right. All right.

440
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,017
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.

441
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,492
Over here. Attaboy.

442
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,695
Okay, bullseye. Upsy-Daisy.

443
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,803
Psst. Bullseye. Cut it out.

444
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,427
Stop it. Psst.
Stop it, bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

445
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,175
Stop it.

446
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,046
Phew.

447
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,125
J Woody's roundup
come on, it's time to play &

448
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,838
- no, officer! I swear.
- What?

449
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,470
Uh... oh.

450
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,269
Get in there.
There you go. Cheap case.

451
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,817
Where is the remote?

452
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,111
Where is the remote?

453
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,025
Why don't I put it in the same place
every... oh, here it is.

454
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,956
What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry
I can't help you guys out.

455
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,758
Really, I am. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.

456
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,926
What? You think I did that?

457
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,426
Oh, right, right.
The TV just happened to turn on,

458
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,882
and the remote magically ended up
in front of you!

459
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,969
- You calling me a liar?
- Well, if the boot fits...

460
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,103
Say that again.

461
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,516
If the boot fits.

462
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,193
Okay, cowboy.

463
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,482
Yah!

464
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,661
How do you like that?
Take it back! Take it back!

465
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,226
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

466
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,662
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

467
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,581
I don't know
how that television turned on,

468
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,792
but fighting about it
isn't helping anything.

469
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,253
- If I had both my arms...
- The fact is, you don't, Woody,

470
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,680
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.

471
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,930
- The cleaner will come, fix your arm...
- And then I'm outta here!

472
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,477
Oh, no, no.
Bullseye, don't take it that way.

473
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,149
- It's just that Andy...
- Andy, Andy, Andy.

474
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,728
That's all he ever talks about.

475
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,327
Hey, buzz, can we slow down?

476
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:55,286
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over $6 in change?

477
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,338
Losing health units. Must rest.

478
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,165
Is everyone present and accounted for?

479
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,591
Not quite everyone.

480
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,168
- Who's behind?
- Mine.

481
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,973
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?

482
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,975
- Not now, hamm.
- Oh, I love riddles. Why?

483
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,355
To get to the chicken
on the other side!

484
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,812
Rex: The chicken!

485
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,118
Oh, well. We tried.
We'll have to cross.

486
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,205
What the...

487
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,076
You're not turning me
into a mashed potato.

488
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:36,536
I may not be a smart dog,
but I know what roadkill is.

489
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,707
There must be a safe way.

490
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,760
Buzz: Okay.
Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.

491
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,689
Drop!

492
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,107
Buzz: Gol

493
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,116
buzz: Drop! I said "drop"!

494
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,658
Buzz: Gol

495
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,671
Buzz: Drop.

496
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,131
Buzz: Go.

497
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,125
That went well.

498
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,964
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.

499
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,802
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

500
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,555
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?

501
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,506
So, how long is this gonna take?

502
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,679
You can't rush art.

503
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,564
Slinky: Oh, no. It's closed.

504
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,741
We're not preschool toys, slinky.
We can read.

505
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,665
Man: Hey, Joe, you're late.

506
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:21,812
We've got a ton of toys to unload.

507
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,202
All right. All right.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

508
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,375
All right. Let's go.

509
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,707
Rex: But the sign says it's closed.

510
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,095
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!

511
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,282
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going
to find Woody in this place?

512
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:03,162
Look for al. We find al,
we find Woody. Now move out!

513
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,665
- Woody?
- Woody.

514
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:18,066
There you go.

515
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,281
He's for display only.

516
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,829
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.

517
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,999
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

518
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,598
Wow.

519
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,284
I could use one of those.

520
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,513
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat zurg unless you buy this book.

521
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,636
It's extortion. That's what it is.

522
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,685
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only...

523
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,748
Hamm: I thought
we could search in style.

524
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,579
Am I really that fat?

525
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,875
Ow!

526
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,693
What are you doing?
You're in direct violation

527
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,958
of code 6404.5,

528
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,590
stating all space rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep

529
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,512
until awakened
by authorized personnel.

530
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,089
Oh, no.

531
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,137
You're breakin' ranks, ranger.

532
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,761
Buzz lightyear to star command.

533
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:13,599
- I've got an awol space ranger.
- Tell me I wasn't this deluded.

534
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,901
No back talk!
I have a laser, and I will use it.

535
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,091
Mean the laser that's a light bulb?

536
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,701
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, space ranger.

537
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,244
Or should I say "traitor"?

538
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,038
- I don't have time for this.
- Halt!

539
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,457
I order you to halt!

540
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,090
Listen to me. Listen. Wait.

541
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,284
We've been down this aisle already.
We've never been down this aisle.

542
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,390
- It's pink.
- Face it. We're lost.

543
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,718
Hamm: Back it up. Back it up.

544
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,519
What a great party!

545
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,357
How low can you go?
How low can you go?

546
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,651
Excuse me, ladies.

547
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,735
Does anyone know where we might
find the al of al's toy barn?

548
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,194
I can help.

549
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,160
I'm tour guide Barbie.

550
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,368
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,

551
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,203
and no flash photography.

552
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,630
- Thank you.
- I'm a married spud.

553
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,675
- I'm a married spud.
- Then make room for the single fellas.

554
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,721
Barbie: To our right is the hot wheels
aisle. Developed in 1967,

555
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,264
the original series had 16 cars,
including the corvette.

556
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,513
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's al's office?

557
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,687
Please hold all questions
until the end of the tour. Thank you.

558
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,186
It says how you defeat zurg! Look!

559
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,938
- Excuse me, sir.
- Get this outta here, geekosaur.

560
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,319
- Slinky:: Look out!
- Stop, stop, stop!

561
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,453
Hamm: Turn into the spin, Barbie!

562
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,741
My source of power!

563
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,453
No! Come back! Hey!

564
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,331
Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down!

565
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,759
- Dinosaur overboard!
- Slow down!

566
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,045
Remain seated, please.

567
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,886
Ow! Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a space ranger.

568
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,518
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?

569
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,315
Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.

570
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:24,146
Let me go! You don't realize
what you're doing!

571
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,981
And this is the buzz lightyear aisle.

572
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:32,287
In 19995, shortsighted retailers did not
order enough dolls to meet demand.

573
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,364
- Hey, buzz!
- Halt! Who goes there?

574
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,116
Quit clownin' around
and get in the car!

575
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,577
Buzz, buzz, I know how to defeat zurg!

576
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,921
- You do?
- Come on. I'll tell you on the way.

577
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:48,504
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong
buzz! You've got the wrong buzz!

578
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,758
Say, where'd you get
the cool belt, buzz?

579
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,307
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.

580
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,135
No!

581
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:10,112
It's like printing my own money.

582
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,513
Yeah? What?

583
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:15,746
Oh, oh. Mr. konishi.
Yes, I have the pictures right here.

584
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:20,452
In fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the office to fax them to you.

585
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,504
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin' up!

586
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:27,334
Oh, wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out of the box!

587
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:31,592
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!

588
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,718
Hi! Hello!

589
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,891
Great. Now you can go.

590
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,306
Well, what a good idea.

591
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,446
Pete: Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.

592
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,154
She's been through
more than you know.

593
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,409
Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?

594
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,699
It's the least you can do.

595
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,712
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.

596
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,307
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

597
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:26,226
Thought I'd get one last look at the
sun before I get packed away again.

598
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,903
Look, Jessie.
I know you hate me for leaving,

599
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,322
but I have to go back.

600
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,401
I'm still Andy's toy.

601
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,870
Well, if you knew him,
you'd understand. Andy's a real...

602
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:41,745
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.

603
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,293
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.

604
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,750
And when Andy plays with you,
it's like even though you're not moving,

605
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,837
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.

606
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,381
How did you know that?

607
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,433
Because Emily was just the same.

608
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,227
She was my whole world.

609
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,559
Woman: J when somebody loved me

610
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:12,112
j everything was beautiful

611
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,783
j every hour we spent together

612
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,862

613

> and when she was sad

614
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,748
j I was there to dry her tears

615
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:32,129
j and when she was happy, so was I

616
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:37,509
js when she loved me

617
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,932
j through the summer and the fall

618
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:48,266
j we had each other that was all

619
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,443
j just she and I together

620
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,364
j like it was meant to be

621
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:59,243
j and when she was lonely

622
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,996
j I was there to comfort her

623
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,450
j and I knew that

624
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:11,835
j she loved me

625
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:22,133
J so the years went by

626
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,810
j I stayed the same

627
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:28,640
j but she began to drift away

628
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:32,818
j I was left alone

629
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:36,113
j still I waited for the day

630
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,444
j when she'd say

631
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:45,408
j I will always love you

632
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,040
j lonely and forgoften

633
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,715
j I never thought she'd look my way

634
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:58,169
j she smiled at me and held me

635
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:02,257
j just like she used to do

636
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:06,185
j like she loved me

637
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:10,106
js when she loved me

638
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:15,186
j when somebody loved me

639
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:19,274
j everything was beautiful

640
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:23,031
j every hour we spent together

641
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:26,865
j lives within my heart

642
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:33,956
> when she loved me jl

643
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:51,647
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.

644
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,230
But they forget you.

645
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,985
- Jessie, I didn't know.
- Just go.

646
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:25,344
How long will it last, Woody?
Do you really think

647
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:29,268
Andy is gonna take you to college
or on his honeymoon?

648
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:36,021
Andy's growing up,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

649
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,733
It's your choice, Woody.

650
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,941
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

651
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:49,451
You'll be adored
by children for generations.

652
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,845
Who am I to break up
the roundup gang?

653
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,198
- Hey, Woody, are you in here?
- Nah. This one's empty too.

654
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:31,155
- Woody! Woody!
- Woody!

655
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,250
Pardon me, gentlemen,

656
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,746
but have either of you seen
a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

657
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,169
- Why, no, I haven't.
- Hey! He was talkin' to me!

658
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,963
- No! He was talkin' to me!
- Why, you...

659
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,336
You see, all along,

660
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:45,044
we thought the way into zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,

661
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:50,133
but in fact the secret entrance is
to the left, hidden in the shadows.

662
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,640
To the left in the shadows. Got it.

663
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,596
- Someone's coming.
- Everyone, take cover.

664
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,254
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want
to bore you with the details.

665
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,610
Yes. Now, let me confirm
your fax number.

666
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,857
- Man: 0171...
- 011. Wait.

667
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,734
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.

668
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,611
- It's him.
- The chicken man.

669
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,317
Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

670
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,744
Slinky: That's the kidnapper, all right.

671
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,665
A kidnapper!
An agent of zurg if I ever saw one.

672
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,542
And the piece de résistance!

673
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,970
I promise the collection will be
the crown Jewel of your museum.

674
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,139
- It's Woody!
- Now that I have your attention,

675
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,093
imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?

676
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:39,023
- I'll pay anything you want.
- Yes! Yes!

677
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,816
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight to Japan!

678
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:43,936
Quick.
Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

679
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,443
He'll lead us to zurg.
Move, move, move!

680
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,491
Don't touch my mustache!

681
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,783
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

682
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,715
Huh?

683
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,828
Destroy buzz lightyear.

684
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,453
Destroy buzz lightyear.
Destroy buzz lightyear.

685
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,298
- Rex: Augh! He didn't take the bag!
- No time to lose!

686
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,017
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.

687
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,142
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.

688
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,101
- Uh, buzz?
- To infinity and beyond!

689
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:53,942
What are you? Insane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

690
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,069
I don't understand.

691
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,995
Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.

692
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,387
Blast. He's on level 23.

693
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,594
How are we gonna get up there?

694
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,350
Maybe if we find some balloons,
we could float to the top.

695
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,932
Are you kidding?
I say we stack ourselves up,

696
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,518
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

697
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,855
How about a ham sandwich
with fries and a hot dog?

698
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,950
What about me?

699
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,899
You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.

700
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,076
Troops! Over here.

701
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,618
Just like you said, lizard man.
"In the shadows to the left."

702
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,498
Okay. Let's move!

703
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,420
Mission log. Have infiltrated
enemy territory without detection

704
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,469
and are making our way
through the bowels of zurg's fortress.

705
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,716
You know, I think that buzz aisle
went to his head.

706
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,967
Slinky: Oh, no. Which way do we go?

707
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,062
This way!

708
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,332
Potato head:
What makes you so sure?

709
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:07,974
I'm buzz lightyear. I'm always sure.

710
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,935
We've been detected. The walls!
They're closing in! Quick!

711
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,111
Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.

712
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,859
Hey! Put me down, you moron!

713
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,488
Guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!

714
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:29,078
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone, grab hold!

715
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,378
Hamm: What? Slinky: Huh?

716
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,923
Uh, buzz,
why not just take the elevator?

717
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,418
They'll be expecting that.

718
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,567
Rex: Hey, buzz! Stop!

719
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,314
Slow down!

720
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:59,158
To overnight six packages
to Japan is how much?

721
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,405
That's in yen, right?

722
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:04,784
Dollars?
You are deliberately taking advantage

723
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,911
of people in a hurry, you know that?

724
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,960
All right.
I'll do it! All right. Fine.

725
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,164
I'll have the stuff in the lobby,
and you'd better be here in 15 minutes,

726
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,170
because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?

727
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,627
Whoo-hoo!

728
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,759
We're finally going.
Can you believe it?

729
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,011
That's custom-fitted

730
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,013
foam insulation
you'll be riding in, bullseye.

731
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,594
First class all the way!

732
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,894
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.

733
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,941
I mean it. I really am!

734
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,520
- And why shouldn't you be?
- Yee-haw!

735
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,901
- Whoa!
- ; Swing your partner do-si-do &

736
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:43,406
- look at you, dancing cowboy!
- Look! I'm doin' the box step!

737
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,001
Uh-oh. Hey, heads up down there!

738
00:59:56,093 --> 01:00:00,962
- Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'.
- Hey, how much farther, buzz?

739
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,718
Halfway there.

740
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:07,472
My arms can't hold on much longer!

741
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,974
Too heavy.

742
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,604
What was I thinking?

743
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,687
My antigravity servos!

744
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:22,195
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go of the wall.

745
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,825
- What?
- He wouldn't.

746
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,698
- One...
- He would.

747
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,950
Two...

748
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,997
Three!

749
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:36,497
To infinity and beyond!

750
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,551
Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.

751
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,683
Area secure.

752
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:53,941
It's okay, troops.

753
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:58,439
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!

754
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,363
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.

755
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,541
How 'bout givin' me
a little intro there, Jessie?

756
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:17,246
Introducing the high-ridin'-est
cowboy around...

757
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,296
You forgot "rootin'-tootin'-est"!

758
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:23,297
The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est
cowboy hero of all time,

759
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,719
sheriff Woody!

760
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,108
Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?

761
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,902
Nary a bit,
not with sheriff Woody around.

762
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,900
Wait, wait, wait! I got it!
This is great! Okay!

763
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,720
The bandits got the critters tied up
in the burning barn. Now the best part!

764
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,735
Help us! The barn's on fire!

765
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,070
I've got ya, critters. No need to worry.

766
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,497
Woody saves the day again!

767
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:53,744
Yee-haw!

768
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,791
Now, where's my trusty steed bullseye?

769
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,416
I have to ride off into the sunset...
Oh!

770
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,919
Ride like the wind, bullseye!

771
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,881
Watch it.
Wait. I'm ticklish, okay?

772
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,556
Oh, you are?

773
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,851
No, no, no. Cut it out.
Stop it. Stop it.

774
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,803
No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!

775
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,236
Mission log. Have reached
zurg's command deck,

776
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,943
but no sign of him
or his wooden captive.

777
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:32,575
- Woody: Please, no!
- That's Woody!

778
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,657
This way!

779
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:40,002
Woody: Please, please, no!

780
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,970
Potato head: Buzz, can you see?
What's going on?

781
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,464
Jessie: Take that!
Potato head: To the left.

782
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,760
No, your left.

783
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,814
- Take it up higher.
- Buzz: What's happening?

784
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,924
Oh, it's horrible.
They... they're torturing him.

785
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,055
What are we gonna do, buzz?

786
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,226
Use your head!

787
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,309
But I don't wanna use my head!

788
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,233
What's going on here?

789
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,485
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you find me?

790
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,698
Watch yourself!

791
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,492
Slinky: We're here
to spring ya, Woody!

792
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,410
You heard of kung fu?

793
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,238
Well, get ready for pork chop.

794
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:20,127
Prepare to meet Mr. angry eyes!

795
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,461
Hold it, now!
Hey, you don't understand!

796
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:23,584
These are my friends!

797
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:26,883
- Yeah, we're his friends!
- No, Rex, I mean they're my friends!

798
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,130
Hey, stop it!

799
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,088
Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey!

800
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,674
- Grab Woody, and let's go!
- Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down!

801
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:37,010
- Quick! To the vent!
- They're stealing him.

802
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,141
Pete: No!

803
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,722
Hold it right there!

804
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,478
- Buzz?
- You again?

805
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,481
- Thank goodness you're all right.
- Buzz, what is going on?

806
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:49,156
Hold on. I am buzz lightyear,
and I'm in charge of this detachment.

807
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,607
No, I'm buzz lightyear.

808
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,382
- I'm buzz lightyear!
- I'm buzz lightyear!

809
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,319
So, who's the real buzz?

810
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,905
- I am!
- Don't let this impostor fool you!

811
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,413
He's been trained by zurg himself
to mimic my every move.

812
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,302
All: Buzz!

813
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,922
I had a feelin' it was you.

814
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,346
My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.

815
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,220
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?

816
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:19,303
It's all right, space ranger.
It's a code 546.

817
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,104
You mean it's a... yes.

818
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,478
- And he's a...
- Oh, yeah.

819
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,694
Your majesty.

820
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,782
Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.

821
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,653
Al's selling you to a toy museum

822
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,609
- in Japan!
- I know.

823
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,787
It's okay, buzz. I actually wanna go.

824
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,284
- What?
- Are you crazy?

825
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:42,459
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare sheriff Woody doll,

826
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,661
and these guys are my roundup gang.

827
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:48,248
- What are you talking about?
- Woody's roundup!

828
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:51,927
Oh, it's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.

829
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,425
Look! Look at me! See? That's me!

830
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,224
- This is weirdin' me out.
- Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

831
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,122
There was all this merchandise
that got packed up.

832
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,352
You should have seen it.

833
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,351
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

834
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,479
- "Was"?
- Stop this nonsense and let's go.

835
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,858
Nah, buzz.

836
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:14,316
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

837
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,697
They need me to get into this museum.

838
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:20,451
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

839
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,535
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

840
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,086
You are a toy!

841
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,757
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.

842
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:33,130
And what do I do then, buzz?
Huh? You tell me.

843
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:36,551
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

844
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,804
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.

845
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:43,395
And I traveled all this way
to rescue that toy

846
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,437
because I believed him.

847
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,357
Well, you wasted your time.

848
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,991
- Let's go, everyone.
- What about Woody?

849
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,903
He's not coming with us.

850
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,666
But... but Andy's coming home tonight.

851
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,835
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

852
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:21,091
I don't have a choice, buzz.
This is my only chance.

853
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,801
To do what, Woody?

854
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:26,229
Watch kids from behind glass
and never be loved again?

855
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,772
Some life.

856
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,021
TV Woody: Is everybody okay?
TV Jessie: Sheriff Woody!

857
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:38,734
- I knew you'd make it!
- Now, remember, deputies,

858
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,535
the real treasures are
your friends and family.

859
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:45,115
Before I go, kids, I want to share
somethin' special with you,

860
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:48,247
- for the times I'm not around.
- Good going, Woody!

861
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,794
I thought they'd never leave.

862
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,997
TV Woody:
J you've got a friend in me

863
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,212
j you've got a friend in me

864
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,961
- Woody?
- J' you've got troubles

865
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,972
j well, I've got 'em too

866
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:05,018
j there isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you

867
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,096
j we stick together
and see it through

868
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:11,558
j 'cause you've got a friend in me

869
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:17,527
j some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

870
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:21,530
j bigger and stronger too maybe

871
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:25,159
j but none of them will ever love you

872
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,960
j the way I do
it's me and you, boy

873
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,583
j and as the years go by

874
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,883
j our friendship will never die

875
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:41,221
- what am I doing?
- J' you're gonna see it's our destiny j

876
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,933
- buzz! Wait! Wait!
- Woody, where are you going?

877
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:48,227
You're right, prospector.
I can't stop Andy from growing up.

878
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,555
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.

879
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,479
Yes? Yes?

880
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,027
I'm coming with you!

881
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:59,277
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll be back in just a second.

882
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:00,948
Way to go, cowboy!

883
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,952
Hey, you guys... come with me.
“What?

884
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,371
Andy will play with all of us.
I know it!

885
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,323
Woody, I don't know. I...

886
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:12,661
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?

887
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:17,465
Come on, Jessie. This is what
it's all about, to make a child happy.

888
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:21,044
And you know it.
Bullseye, are you with me?

889
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,592
Okay, good boy.

890
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,469
Prospector, how 'bout you?

891
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:32,389
- Jessie: Prospector?
- You're outta your box!

892
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,983
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,

893
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,688
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.

894
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,655
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, not Jessie.

895
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:48,364
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.

896
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,450
Let's not start off
by pointing fingers, shall we?

897
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,580
You really are stinky Pete, aren't you?

898
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:54,956
Prospector, this isn't fair.

899
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:58,418
"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.

900
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:04,095
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store
shelf watching every other toy be sold.

901
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,301
Well, finally my waiting has paid off,

902
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:10,886
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!

903
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,849
Buzz. Help, buzz! Guys!

904
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:20,061
It's too late, Woody. That silly
buzz lightweight can't help you.

905
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,021
His name is buzz lightyear.

906
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:26,029
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.

907
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,112
It's stuck! What do we do?

908
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,448
Should I use my head?

909
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,874
_lt's all

910
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,663
look at the time. I'm gonna be late!

911
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,999
Figures. I can't miss this flight!
I've gotta pack.

912
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,961
All right. Let's see.
Wallet, keys, tickets,

913
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,216
passport, beef jerky,
very expensive over there.

914
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,389
Shower!
Oh, I can skip the shower.

915
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:52,389
I just gotta get outta here now!

916
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:54,888
Quick! To the elevator!

917
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:02,729
Hurry. I can hear it coming.

918
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,782
So, we meet again, buzz lightyear,

919
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,283
for the last time.

920
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:16,368
Aah! It's zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!

921
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,054
Quick! Get on!

922
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,976
The emergency hatch! Come on!

923
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,124
Huh?

924
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,212
- Come on! Hurry!
- But buzz is in peril!

925
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,042
Voice box: Buzz, buzz, buzz...

926
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,888
Surrender, buzz lightyear. I have won.

927
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,732
I'll never give in.
You killed my father!

928
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:25,904
No, buzz. I am your father.

929
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,866
No!

930
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:33,745
Come on! Come on! Come on!

931
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:40,622
Buzz, you could have
defeated zurg all along!

932
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,796
You just need to believe in yourself!

933
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:47,000
- Prepare to die!
- I can't look!

934
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:51,342
Whoa!

935
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:58,724
I did it. I finally defeated zurg!

936
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:00,809
Father.

937
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,235
Ah, finally!

938
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,932
How are we gonna get him now?

939
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,556
Pizza, anyone?

940
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,851
- G 0, go, go!
- I got it!

941
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:43,977
Buzz, are you coming?

942
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:47,560
No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.

943
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:53,316
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, buzzy!

944
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:56,403
- Oh, you're a great dad. Yippee!
- Farewell.

945
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,992
Does anyone know how to drive?

946
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,495
Slink, take the pedals.
Rex, you navigate.

947
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:04,328
Hamm and potato,
operate the levers and knobs.

948
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,329
Whoa.

949
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,922
Ohh.

950
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,001
- Strangers.
- From the outside.

951
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:14,212
- Oh, no.
- He's at a red light! We can catch him!

952
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,923
Maximum power, slink!

953
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,263
Whaal! It turned green! Hurry!

954
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,891
- Why won't it go?
- Use the wand of power.

955
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,978
Och! Ow! Ooh!

956
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:33,314
- Rex, which way?
- Left! No, no! I mean right!

957
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,446
That's right! No, I mean left!
Left is right!

958
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:39,449
Buzz, he's turning left!
He's turning left!

959
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,578
Oh, oh, boy!

960
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,834
Whoa!

961
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,459
Oh, I seriously doubt
he's gettin' this kind of mileage.

962
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,549
Go right! To the right!
Right, right, right, right!

963
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:55,378
Whoa!

964
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:58,055
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

965
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,632
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

966
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,898
Woman over pa: The white zone is
for immediate loading and unloading...

967
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,064
No parking.

968
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,952
Guys, we can't park here!
It's a white zone!

969
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,156
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

970
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,037
- Final boarding call...
- There he is!

971
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,743
For far east airlines
flight 451 to Tokyo.

972
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,829
All confirmed passengers
with boarding passes

973
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,664
must board at this time.

974
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,757
Man over pa: Passenger twitch,

975
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:36,836
passenger Leon twitch,
please pick up...

976
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,593
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

977
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,174
Potato head:
Will you leave me alone?

978
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,428
Rex: Someone's coming!

979
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,102
- Girl: Ooh, a puppy!
- Bark, bark, bark, bark.

980
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,520
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

981
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:48,775
Listen, flyboy.

982
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:51,692
The contents of that case are
worth more than you make in a year!

983
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:54,111
- You got that, sport? You be careful!
- I understand, sir.

984
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,985
Do you have a "fragile" sticker
or something?

985
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,156
I had a box of cookies once
that came back as crumbs!

986
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,453
- The mystic portal!
- Oooh.

987
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:06,365
Once we go through,
we just need to find that case.

988
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:24,225
- Ow! There's the case!
- No, there's the case!

989
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,094
You take that one! We'll take this one!

990
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,533
Whoa! Buzz!

991
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,407
Buzz, my back end's
goin' to Baton Rouge!

992
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,999
Slinky!

993
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:51,248
Here we come, Woody!
Woody, here we come! Woody!

994
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,454
Nice flash, though.

995
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:08,849
Okay, Woody, let's go!

996
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:12,181
Take that, space toy.

997
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,268
Hey! No one does that
to my friend!

998
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,738
Your choice, Woody.

999
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,195
You can go to Japan together
or in pieces.

1000
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,999
If he fixed ya once,
he can fix ya again. Now get in the box!

1001
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,168
- Never!
- Finel

1002
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,502
- No! Aaah!
- Gotchal

1003
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,133
idiots! Children destroy toys!

1004
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,431
You'll all be ruined, forgotten!

1005
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,510
Spending eternity
rotting in some landfill!

1006
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:53,724
Well, stinky Pete, I think it's time you
learned the true meaning of playtime.

1007
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:57,936
- Right over there, guys!
- No. No! No!

1008
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:02,945
Woman over pa: Atlantic air
flight 810 from point Richmond

1009
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,775
is now arriving at gate 3.

1010
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:08,704
Girl: Look, Barbie.
A big, ugly man doll.

1011
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,702
Ooh, he needs a makeover.

1012
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:15,662
“Hil you'll like Amy.

1013
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,540
She's an artist!

1014
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,384
Mother: Come on, hon!

1015
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,880
Happy trails, prospector.

1016
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,716
- Buzz! Woody!
- Help us out here!

1017
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,926
Hurry!

1018
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:34,434
- Oh, no. Jessie! Come on!
- Oh, Woody!

1019
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,616
Jessie!

1020
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,617
Come on, buzz.

1021
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:50,537
- Yah!
- Ride like the wind, bullseye!

1022
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,754
Hey-howdy-hey! Giddyap!

1023
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,843
Buzz: Come on, bullseye! Yah!

1024
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,506
Buzz, give me a boost!

1025
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,560
- Oh! Ohh! Oohhh!
- Woody!

1026
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,433
Here's the rest!

1027
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,660
Excuse me, ma'am, but I believe
you're on the wrong flight.

1028
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,711
- Woody!
- Come on, Jess.

1029
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:23,664
- It's time to take you home.
- But

1030
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,875
- what if Andy doesn't like me?
- Nonsense!

1031
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,006
Andy'll love you! Besides,

1032
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,338
- he's got a little sister.
- He does?

1033
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,048
Why didn't you say so? Let's go!
“Whoa!

1034
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:40,060
Man: Hold it! There's a couple
more bags coming from the terminal!

1035
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,015
Okay. On three.

1036
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,693
- One, two...
- Too late!

1037
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,691
Put 'em on the next flight!

1038
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:56,239
- This is bad.
- How are we gonna get outta here?

1039
01:19:58,168 --> 01:19:59,908
Over there! Come on!

1040
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:16,012
- You sure about this?
- No! Let's go!

1041
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,830
Hold on, Woody!

1042
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:46,714
- What's a cowboy without his hat?
- Buzz!

1043
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:03,059
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tires!

1044
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,858
Jessie, let go of the plane!

1045
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,280
What? Are you crazy?

1046
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:15,485
Just pretend it's
the final episode of Woody's roundup.

1047
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:19,117
But it was canceled!
We never saw if you made it!

1048
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,119
Well, then, let's find out together!

1049
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,000
Oh-oh-oh.

1050
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,036
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1051
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,550
Nice ropin', cowboy.

1052
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,307
That was definitely
Woody's finest hour!

1053
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,605
Your hat, partner.

1054
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:47,604
Hoo-hoo!

1055
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,855
Let's go home.

1056
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:00,992
Yee-haw!

1057
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,002
Hey, Woody! Woody?

1058
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,723
Oh, wow! New toys!

1059
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,801
Cool! Thanks, mom!

1060
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,391
It's bazooka Jane
and her jet-propelled horse!

1061
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:30,396
Woody, buzz, that polecat zurg
has stolen my space cows!

1062
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,866
Andy, come on, hon. Time to go.

1063
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,664
Hey, you fixed Woody! Yeah.

1064
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:49,040
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.

1065
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,509
Well, what do you know?

1066
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:58,804
Yee-haw!

1067
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,256
Oh, bullseye,

1068
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,932
we're part of a family again!

1069
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:05,897
Hmm?

1070
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,978
Uh, ma'am, I, uh...

1071
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:12,104
I wanted to say
you're a bright young woman

1072
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,061
with a beautiful "yarnful” of hair.

1073
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,898
"Hairful” of yarn. It's, uh...
Whoo... uh...

1074
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,482
I must go.

1075
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,115
Well, aren't you the sweetest
space toy I ever met?

1076
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,657
What's that? Bark, bark?

1077
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:30,336
This fella says he needs to go out
back for a little private time.

1078
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,253
That critter needs help!

1079
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,964
J yodel-ay-hee-hoo j

1080
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:43,969
ooh, ooh, oh...

1081
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,926
Hey, Rex,
I could use a hand over here, buddy.

1082
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,854
I don't need to play. I've lived it!

1083
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,557
No, no, no, no! Oh, nuts!

1084
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:53,688
Welcome to al's toy barn.

1085
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,566
We've got the lowest prices in town.

1086
01:23:56,657 --> 01:24:01,242
Everything for a buck, buck, buck.

1087
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,658
Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.

1088
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:08,036
Oh, Andy did a great job, huh?
Nice and strong!

1089
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:11,710
I like it. Makes you look tough.

1090
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,957
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

1091
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:20,010
You saved their lives? Oh, my hero!

1092
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:23,635
And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!

1093
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,840
Daddy!

1094
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,926
Oh, no.

1095
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:29,936
Wheezy, you're fixed!

1096
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:34,357
Oh, yeah. Mr. shark looked in the toy
box and found me an extra squeaker.

1097
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:37,527
- And how do you feel?
- Oh, I feel swell.

1098
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:42,074
In fact, I think I feel a song
comin' on.

1099
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:47,412
Robert goulet's voice:
J you've got a friend in me

1100
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,579
j you've got a friend in me

1101
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:55,208
j you just remember
what your old pal said

1102
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:58,291
j' babe, you've got a friend in me

1103
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:01,718
j' yeah, you've got a friend in me j

1104
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,218
come on over.
Oh, you are such a big girl.

1105
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,391
Andy, you think she's ready
to drive the car yet?

1106
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:09,217
Yeah, and I can teach her.

1107
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,141
- You still worried?
- About Andy?

1108
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:16,601
- Nah. It'll be fun while it lasts.
- I'm proud of you, cowboy.

1109
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:21,314
Besides, when it all ends, I'll have old
buzz lightyear to keep me company

1110
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:24,024
for infinity and beyond.

1111
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,453
J you're gonna see it's our destiny

1112
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,326
- j&' you've got a friend in me
- & yes, you do

1113
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:37,879
j&' you've got a friend in me
= that's the truth

1114
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,541
j you've got a friend

1115
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:45,801
jinmelj

1116
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:48,517
yeah!

1117
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,726
Man 1: Speed. Man 2: Marker.

1118
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,178
Man 3: And action.

1119
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:04,156
Okay.
A little help here, please.

1120
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,705
- What are we gonna do, buzz?
- Use your head!

1121
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:14,204
But I don't wanna use my head!

1122
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,957
Rex: Ow!

1123
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,088
Man 1: Speed. Man 2: Marker.

1124
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,790
Man 3: Okay, and pull back.

1125
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,423
Whew!

1126
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,631
- I don't remember eating that.
- Man: Cut.

1127
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,703
- I can't believe this.
- That's the fifth time.

1128
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,558
- What row is that guy in?
- Sorry.

1129
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:36,230
I had that bean burrito for lunch.
Okay, I'm all right now. Sorry.

1130
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:37,726
Man: And action.

1131
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:43,320
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

1132
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:47,733
And if you get hungry,
here's some cheese puffs. And a key.

1133
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:50,035
I don't know what it's for,
but you never know.

1134
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:51,987
Man 1: Speed. Man 2: Marker.

1135
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,492
Man 3: And action.

1136
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:54,993
Whoo!

1137
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,164
Could...? Should we just...?

1138
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:03,899
Should that just be part
of the movie now?

1139
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,760
He lost... he lost his string.

1140
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:12,512
And the golf ball,
if you have time for golf.

1141
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:17,562
And a plastic steak
and a rubber ducky and a yo-yo.

1142
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,686
- Who's behind?
- Mine.

1143
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:25,403
Man: All right, cut. Good take.

1144
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:28,027
What good acting.
That was a good take.

1145
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:30,780
You're such a cute little bottom.

1146
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:32,953
Look at you. Look at you.
Look at you. Look at you.

1147
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:37,624
In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.

1148
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:42,458
Mr. Mike, I'm so sorry.
Did I hurt your equipment?

1149
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:44,623
You gotta aim it right here at my flipper.

1150
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:46,299
I'm not a very good catch.

1151
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:48,968
- Okay, I'm ready for another take.
- Man: Let's go again.

1152
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:55,176
Oh, no! Oh, no,
I think I swallowed my squeaker!

1153
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,813
And an extra-bouncy bouncy ball.

1154
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,892
And some extra teeth.
Be careful, they chatter.

1155
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,442
“Whoa!

1156
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,779
Man 1: Marker.
Man 2: And action.

1157
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,907
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

1158
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:20,117
What? What're you laughing about?

1159
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,910
Huh?

1160
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,495
Real funny, Woody.

1161
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:26,002
Man: We're losing our light.
Wipe it off and let's go again.

1162
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,591
Golly Bob howdy.

1163
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:32,888
What? What's so funny? Woody!

1164
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:37,394
Huh?

1165
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,011
- Darn it, Woody!
- Man: Okay, let's go again.

1166
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:43,645
And crayons, in case you get bored.

1167
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,691
And some blue play-doh.

1168
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,816
Isn't this exciting, heimlich?
Our first day of shooting.

1169
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:55,277
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so exciting!

1170
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:58,580
You know, I can't believe you talked
them into making a bug's life 2.

1171
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,409
Oh, oh, yeah,
I can hardly believe it also.

1172
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:05,416
Oh, but there's a little baby tiny thing
I forgot to tell you.

1173
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:06,507
What's that, heimlich?

1174
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:11,631
Well, it's a "2" movie,
but it's not a bug's life 2.

1175
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:14,303
What...? I don't understand.
What is it then?

1176
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,801
Man: And action.

1177
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,768
Man 1: Speed.
Man 2: Wait. Let me check focus.

1178
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:22,687
So, did you make it
into the first toy story?

1179
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,389
Well, if you look at the letterbox copy,

1180
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,145
you can see my arm
grabbing Woody's ankle.

1181
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,316
What are you gonna do next?

1182
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,648
Well, I'm up for this villain
in a toothpaste commercial.

1183
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:31,070
- Wow, that's great.
- Really?

1184
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:35,071
And a dime, call me.
And monkey chow.

1185
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:36,742
Monkey chow? For what?

1186
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:39,287
Well, for the monkeys, of course.

1187
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,830
Come on, monkeys.

1188
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:45,286
That's it. I draw the line at monkeys.
Get my agent on the phone!

1189
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,496
Man 1: Marker.
Man 2: And action.

1190
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,128
It's your choice, Woody.

1191
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:54,587
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

1192
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:59,758
Good heavens. Was that me?

1193
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:04,096
Oh, my. I am so sorry.

1194
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:07,391
I guess that's why they call me
stinky Pete. Whoo!

1195
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:08,895
Man: Okay, let's cut.

1196
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,110
We are so glad you came.

1197
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,939
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1198
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:16,275
Bye-bye, now. Bye. Bye-bye.

1199
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:20,282
Remember, please discard all candy
wrappers and popcorn containers

1200
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:23,536
in the nearest trash receptacle.
Thank you.

1201
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:27,040
Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye. Bye.

1202
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,121
Okay.

1203
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:31,706
Are they all gone?

1204
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,797
Is everybody gone?

1205
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:36,469
Huh?

1206
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:40,299
Good. Oh, my gosh,
my cheeks are killing me.

1207
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:44,386
I can't keep smiling like this anymore.
I am exhausted.

1208
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,562
I think I need a break.

1209
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,686
A little break? Okay.

1210
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:49,985
Whew.

1211
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:41,947

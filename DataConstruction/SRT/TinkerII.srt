Oh! Oh!

32
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,256
Yeah, okay. There you go!

33
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:26,922
No, no, no!

34
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:33,892
Good job.

35
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:42,335

00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:47,071

42
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,596
- Morning, Stone.
- Hey, Terence.

43
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,394
Come on, let's go. Flap your wings!

44
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:47,199
Those fairies on the mainland
won't be able to fly without pixie dust!

45
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:50,605
Terence, have you delivered
the pixie-dust rations to the scouts yet?

46
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,177
Yep. Finished today's
and half of tomorrow's.

47
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:58,045
Remember, one cup each.
No more, no less.

48
00:04:58,684 --> 00:05:00,379
I know, Fairy Gary.

49
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,228
Well, that's my cue.
I'll catch you guys later.

50
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,539
And where are you off to?

51
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:24,302
Just doing some errands and stuff.

52
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:29,647
- Errands!
- And stuff!

53
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:31,943
Why are you guys talking like that?

54
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,314
No reason.

55
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:39,421
- All right.
- Say hi to Tinker Bell, would you?

56
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:40,583
What?

57
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:44,627
Very funny.

58
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,958
All right, you got me.
I'm gonna help Tink again.

59
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,128
- Is it okay if I take this?
- Sure.

60
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,932
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

61
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:03,841
Hammer.

62
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:18,687
Thanks. Okay, try it now, Cheese.

63
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,128
Yeah, that's it!
Keep going. Keep going!

64
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:27,666
Hey, Cheese.
Special delivery for Tinker Bell.

65
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,400
Hi, Terence.

66
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:32,375
Who's your best friend
that always delivers?

67
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:33,633
Hmm.

68
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:36,213
- Iridessa?
- Nope. Try again.

69
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,213
- Fawn?
- Me!

70
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:41,343
Just kidding.

71
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:44,513
<i>So, what do you think
of the Pixie Dust Express?</i>

72
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,521
Wow. The guys are gonna love this
back at the depot,

73
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:51,856
and it sure is going to help out
on the river-outpost deliveries.

74
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,761
Hey, is that a stretchy thingy?

75
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:56,925
Yeah, I thought you could use it
for your motor.

76
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,230
I think it's gonna be perfect.

77
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:08,103
Clip.

78
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,887
All right, Cheese, ready to launch.

79
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:18,616
Aah!

80
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:22,490
It floats!

81
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,299
Okay. Are you ready
for the official test run?

82
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,133
Don't worry. I'll be right next to you.

83
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:32,794
- All set?
- Check.

84
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,370
Let her rip.

85
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:41,838
Whoa.

86
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,349
And now for hydro-drive.

87
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,185
Sorry.

88
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:58,754
Whoa!

89
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:00,891
Oh, no!

90
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:14,503
Hmm.

91
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,878
Ooh!

92
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:36,832
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

93
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:40,667
I can't believe the boat broke.

94
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:44,333
I guess your guys
are gonna have to wait a little longer.

95
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:45,932
I'm impressed.

96
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:49,673
Usually when one of your inventions
doesn't work out, you overreact,

97
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,874
but I must say,
you're handling this one pretty well.

98
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,713
- I drove it into a tree?
- Never mind.

99
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,382
Jingles!

100
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:01,481
I made it to help you, Terence.
It should've worked.

101
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,060
Come on.
Look, it just needs a little tinkering.

102
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:10,191
Let's see.
Who do I know who's a good tinker?

103
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:13,068
Bobble. Bobble's a good tinker.

104
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:16,072
Or Fairy Mary,
she's got a lot of experience.

105
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:17,968
Or... Hey, what about Clank?

106
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,747
Uh-oh.

107
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:26,942
- Someone's in trouble.
- Hey, I haven't done anything, lately.

108
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:28,817
The stinkbug incident?

109
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,282
Oh, no.

110
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:34,425
Tinker Bell, Queen Clarion awaits.

111
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,929
It's all
a big misunderstanding.

112
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:44,365
I'm sure the queen wants to see me
about something completely unrelated.

113
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,901
One moment.

114
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:53,168
Tinker Bell is here.
She's waiting outside, my lady.

115
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,870
Thank you, Viola.

116
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,772
- Fairy Mary, are you certain?
- Whatever do you mean?

117
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:02,820
Only that Tinker Bell,
while undoubtedly talented, also...

118
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:06,152
- Is a hothead? Flies off the handle?
- Well, yes.

119
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:08,818
I believe she deserves a chance,
Minister.

120
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:12,192
After all, tinker fairies
learn from their mistakes.

121
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,563
Very well.

122
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:18,025
Agreed. Tinker Bell!

123
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,000
Fairy Mary tells me she knows...

124
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:31,310
It's not my fault, Your Highness!
Those stinkbugs were asking for it.

125
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:39,879
- This isn't about the stinkbugs, is it?
- No.

126
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:42,516
But we can certainly
come back to that later.

127
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:43,685
Mary.

128
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,325
You do know the Minister of Autumn.

129
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:49,263
- My dear.
- Hi.

130
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:52,697
Are you familiar
with the great autumn revelry?

131
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:56,205
Well, everyone's talking about it.
They're so excited.

132
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:58,499
Since time immemorial,

133
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,807
fairies have celebrated
the end of autumn with a revelry,

134
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:07,215
and this particular autumn
coincides with a blue harvest moon.

135
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:11,314
A new scepter must be created
to celebrate the occasion.

136
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:15,851
Behold, the Hall of Scepters.

137
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:23,393
- They're beautiful.
- Every scepter is unique.

138
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,202
Some are the work of animal fairies,

139
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:29,967
some of light fairies, or water fairies,
or garden fairies.

140
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:34,003
This year,
it is the turn of the tinker fairies.

141
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:37,513
And Fairy Mary has recommended you.

142
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,147
- Me? But I'm... I'm...
- A very talented tinker.

143
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,851
The scepter must be built
to precise dimensions.

144
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,725
At the top, you will place a moonstone.

145
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,363
When the blue moon is at its peak,

146
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:01,667
its rays will pass through the gem,
creating blue pixie dust.

147
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:06,102
The blue pixie dust
restores the pixie dust tree.

148
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:10,947
Like autumn itself,
it signals rebirth and rejuvenation.

149
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,508
We are relying on you.

150
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:16,276
This way, dear.

151
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,421
Here is the moonstone.

152
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:25,029
It has been handed down
from generation to generation.

153
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,358
Be careful. It is ridiculously fragile.

154
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:34,631
Fairy Mary, I... I don't know what to say.

155
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:38,370
- Thank you!
- Careful, Tinker Bell! Fragile!

156
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:41,877
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

157
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:47,885
- Why are you counting?
- It helps to calm me down.

158
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:53,490
Got it. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
I'll make you proud, all of you.

159
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,957
Yahoo!

160
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:04,826
Tink!

161
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:07,462
Tink?

162
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:10,631
Hey!

163
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,747
So?

164
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:18,440
Terence, you're never
gonna believe this.

165
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,383
Guess what happened! Go on, guess!

166
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,009
Well, I...

167
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:26,284
I have been picked
to make the new fall scepter!

168
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,452
Me! Me!

169
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:32,257
Hey, that means they...
They gave you the moonstone?

170
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:33,922
Yeah! Want to see?

171
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:43,164
Not so close. Don't breathe on it.
It's fragile.

172
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,108
Yeah, I know. I know all about it.

173
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:49,804
The blue moon only rises
in Pixie Hollow every eight years.

174
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,940
The trajectory of the light beam's gotta
match the curvature of the moonstone

175
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,450
at a 90-degree angle

176
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,543
so the light can transmute
into pixie dust.

177
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:59,782
Wow, Terence!
Now, how'd you know all that?

178
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:04,084
Well, you know, every dust-keeper's
gotta study dustology.

179
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:06,026
Hey! You know what this calls for?

180
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,996
- Two cups of...
- Chamomile tea.

181
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:10,363
- With extra honey and...
- And some milkweed whip.

182
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,371
Hey, by the way, that new
bucket-and-pulley system you made?

183
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:17,202
Fairy Gary loves it.

184
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,969
- He's so cute.
- Lf you say so.

185
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:25,111
You know what? Maybe I can help you.
You know, I'm kind of an expert on this.

186
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:28,242
I can collect the supplies
and give you advice.

187
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:33,281
- You will? That's... That's so sweet.
- Hey, what are friends for?

188
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:36,486
So, what do you say?
Can I be your wingman?

189
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:37,959
That would be great.

190
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:40,623
- The best dust-keeper fairy.
- And the best tinker!

191
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:42,996
This is gonna be
a revelry to remember.

192
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:51,339
Knock-knock.

193
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:56,411
- Morning.
- Hi.

194
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:02,208
All right, we have one full moon
until the autumn revelry. Here we go.

195
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,687
Hey, Tink!
I brought you some stuff from work.

196
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:08,850
Whoa.

197
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,654
Wow, Terence, how did you...

198
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:16,197
I love this thing!

199
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,895
I can tell you're gonna be a big help.

200
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:21,096
Looks good.

201
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:23,265
Now, remember,
you get the most blue pixie dust

202
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:26,309
if you maximize the moonstone's
exposed surface area.

203
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:27,673
Right. Got it.

204
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,216
Knock-knickity-knock!

205
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:40,690
Out of bed, sleepyhead.

206
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,620
You gotta keep the fire nice and hot.

207
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:05,949
Excuse me, Tink.

208
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,747
Yeah, you know, you should
really keep that workspace clean.

209
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:13,654
Okay, let me just...
Let me get that one right there.

210
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:19,224
Just one more. Thank you.

211
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,298
- Whoa!
- One, two, three...

212
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,457
- Why are you counting?
...four...

213
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:29,568
Knickity-knickity-knock!
Knickity-knock!

214
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:34,909
Watch your angle there.

215
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,403
Knock-knock!
Who's there?

216
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:02,764
Knock. Knock who?
Knock-knock-knickity-knock!

217
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:04,532
Knickity-knock.

218
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:37,434
Steady.

219
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:41,041
You gotta be easy.
This is the tricky part.

220
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,240
I know.

221
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:47,741
All right, now we gotta match
the trajectory of the light beam

222
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,843
- with the...
- Got it. Thanks.

223
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:51,444
- With the...
- Okay. Yeah, I know.

224
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:52,887
- With the...
- Shh!

225
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:58,658
- The curvature of the moonstone.
- Will you please...

226
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:11,532
Tink, it looks like you need
some sort of, you know, sharp thingy.

227
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,769
That's exactly what I need.

228
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:17,710
Could you go out
and find me something sharp?

229
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:20,079
You got it. I'll be right back.

230
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:21,785
Take your time.

231
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:32,193
Clank, what is that?

232
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:37,498
This is a fireworks launcher.
Allow me to demonstrate.

233
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:42,335
Iridessa and Rosetta will mix
light crystals with flower pigment.

234
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,005
The mixture will go into the launcher,
like so.

235
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:49,174
Then I tighten the spring, like so.

236
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,005
- Oh, dear. Clank...
- Then you throw the trigger...

237
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,243
- Yes, Clank...
...and the fireworks shoot into the air!

238
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,910
- Clank!
- Like so!

239
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,215
Clanky, that's brilliant!

240
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:06,753
Hey, Bobble. Listen, do you know
where I can find a sharp thingy?

241
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,666
- A sharp thingy?
- How about a stick?

242
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:16,301
- No, a sharp thingy-majigy.
- A stick can be pretty sharp!

243
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:19,772
No, I need something sharper
to help Tink.

244
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:21,535
For Tink!

245
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:25,673
- Clank, don't sneak up on me like that.
- Did you try the cove?

246
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,284
Of course! That's where
all the lost things wash up.

247
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:33,483
- Thanks, Bobble. Thanks, Clank.
- Our pleasure. So long, Terence!

248
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,619
I'm getting a little dizzy.

249
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:39,389
Uh-oh.

250
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:50,768
Perfect.

251
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:55,970
And now for the finishing touch,
a spattering of silver shavings.

252
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:02,377
Steady. I can't wait till she sees this.

253
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:07,248
Oh!

254
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:19,926
There. Perfect.

255
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:23,367
- Finally.
- Hey, Tink! I'm back!

256
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,774
- What is this?
- It's your sharp thingy.

257
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:33,974
My... That's not...

258
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:37,180
One, two, three, four...

259
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:41,853
Terence, this is not sharp.
This is round.

260
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,161
It is, in fact, the exact opposite of sharp.

261
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:49,724
- Really, look, if you look inside, it's...
- I need to work, okay?

262
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:53,296
Now, would you please
get this thing out of here?

263
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:03,744
My scepter!

264
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:09,982
Tink, I'm so sorry. I...

265
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:13,585
- Out, Terence! Just go!
- What?

266
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:17,719
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

267
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:20,093
- This is your fault!
- Tink, I...

268
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:24,926
- I was just trying to be a good friend. I...
- Go away! Just leave me alone!

269
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,734
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

270
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:50,417
Ow! Ow! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

271
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,155
No.

272
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:20,514
Kept her workspace clean,
brought her food, stoked the fire!

273
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:23,659
"Find a sharp thingy."
Searched high and low,

274
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,021
and she didn't even say thank you!

275
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:32,961
Whoa.

276
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:44,837
I know some rock fairies
that are gonna be pretty upset.

277
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,048
What? There are no rock fairies.

278
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:51,551
You never know. There might be.

279
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,223
Are you okay?

280
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:57,217
Yeah, I'm great! Why do you ask?

281
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:03,158
I'm... No. I'm sorry.
I... I had a fight with Tink.

282
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,702
What happened?

283
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:10,440
There was just an accident,
and she just... She just exploded. I...

284
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:12,408
She exploded?

285
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:14,572
No, no, I don't mean like that.

286
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,079
I mean, she just yelled at me,
you know? And...

287
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:18,239
Oh!

288
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:21,511
Did she turn red?

289
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,348
Well, of course she turned red!
It's Tink!

290
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:26,923
Just give her a chance to cool off.

291
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:30,719
Yeah, you're probably right.

292
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:56,582
- Hello, Tink!
- Clank! Bobble!

293
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:59,788
Came to see if you wanted to join us
for fairytale theater.

294
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,949
We figure you could use
a real break.

295
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,755
Break? Nothing's broken!
What do you mean?

296
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,454
What do you know?

297
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:08,323
Sorry, fellas. Busy.

298
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:11,162
You know, the revelry,
fall scepter, whatnot.

299
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,634
I can't wait to see that scepter!

300
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,904
- Try.
- Is it as beautiful as I imagine?

301
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:19,301
Uh...

302
00:24:19,477 --> 00:24:22,412
- No.
- Terence told us it's amazing.

303
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:25,107
We're so proud of you.

304
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:30,717
- Look, guys, I really don't have time.
- Well, not to worry, Tink.

305
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:33,346
We'll tell Fairy Mary
you couldn't make it.

306
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:35,391
- Fairy Mary?
- Well, sure!

307
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:38,621
You know her.
She never misses fairytale theater.

308
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:40,691
Bye-bye!

309
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:47,595
Clank! Bobble! Wait for me!

310
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,411
Fairy Mary, I...

311
00:24:57,515 --> 00:25:00,746
Tinker Bell!
I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

312
00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:03,247
Have you finished the scepter?

313
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:05,888
Well, not exactly.

314
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:09,693
I... I was wondering...
I mean, I have to ask you...

315
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:11,552
Yes?

316
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:13,591
It's about the moonstone.

317
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:17,691
What happened to it? You didn't lose it.
Tell me you didn't lose it!

318
00:25:17,802 --> 00:25:20,430
- I didn't lose it.
- Good.

319
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:24,440
But I was thinking, if using one
moonstone creates blue pixie dust,

320
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:26,908
using two would create even more.

321
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:29,012
Do you have another moonstone?

322
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:33,277
That moonstone is the only one found
in the last 100 years.

323
00:25:33,718 --> 00:25:35,481
And thank goodness we found it.

324
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:39,044
Without the blue dust,
the pixie dust tree would grow weak,

325
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:42,353
and things would be pretty tough
around here, believe you me.

326
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,620
Are you okay? You look sort of pale.

327
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:51,991
- Wait. I know what's going on.
- You do?

328
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:57,036
You've been working too hard.
What you need is a little theater.

329
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:01,444
Knowing you, you'd probably redo
the whole scepter if you could.

330
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:04,445
- Is that an option?
- Tinker Bell!

331
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,344
How exciting!

332
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:46,886
<i>- Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!
- Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!</i>

333
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:53,362
<i>- 'T is the moment for ancient fairy lore
- 'T is the moment for ancient fairy lore</i>

334
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:56,299
Tinker Bell, do you mind?

335
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:00,233
Sorry. Skunk training.

336
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,169
<i>- Hush, fairies! Hush!
- Hush, fairies! Hush!</i>

337
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:09,179
<i>- For a fairytale of yore!
- For a fairytale of yore!</i>

338
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,949
'Twas a distant fall

339
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:19,983
when a pirate ship
arrived in Neverland.

340
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,356
The dreaded pirates swarmed ashore,

341
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:28,461
seeking the greatest
and most elusive prize of all.

342
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,293
A fairy.

343
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:33,536
Pirates give me the willies!

344
00:27:33,637 --> 00:27:37,573
Far and wide, the pirates searched
until they found a fairy.

345
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,607
They chased her, captured her

346
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:44,238
and forced her to lead them
to the most magical treasure,

347
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:47,346
the enchanted Mirror of Incanta.

348
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:56,088
Forged by fairy magic in ages past,

349
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:59,893
the mirror had the power
to grant three wishes,

350
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:02,862
anything precious to your heart.

351
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,903
- Fairy Mary, is this true?
- Every word.

352
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,835
The pirates used two wishes,

353
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:13,272
but before they could use
the third wish,

354
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:18,411
the ship was wrecked
on an island north of Neverland.

355
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:24,777
The Mirror of Incanta,
with its last remaining wish,

356
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:28,556
was lost forever.

357
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:38,496
Yet it is said that the clues to find it
are hidden in this ancient chant.

358
00:28:39,703 --> 00:28:42,934
"Journey due north past Neverland

359

362
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:00,790

365
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:12,491
What did she say?

366
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:14,696
I think she said something
about a toll bridge.

367
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:16,170
- Toll bridge?
- Yeah.

368
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:18,798
- But I don't know how much it costs.
- Oh?

Pan. Chart.

Extra clothes.

385
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:55,898
This one's not for traveling.

386
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,935
How am I gonna carry all this?

387
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:02,836
Not enough.

388
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:07,012
- There you go. One cup, dear.
- Thank you.

389
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,612
Fairy Gary. Hi.

390
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,648
Hello, Tink. What brings you here?

391
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,289
I see that bucket-and-pulley system
I rigged for you is working out.

392
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:19,453
You know, Fairy Gary,
you really run a tight ship.

393
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:23,693
I know it sounds like I'm just saying it,
but you really do. Really.

394
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,266
That's very sweet, dear.

395
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:29,829
Anyway, I was wondering,
can I have some extra pixie dust?

396
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:33,468
Pardon?

397
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:36,876
Come on, Fairy Gary. Please?
Just a smidge?

398
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:41,041
Now, Tinker Bell, you know the rules,

399
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:45,382
and it says here
you already got your ration.

400
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,623
Iridessa! Rosetta!

401
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:57,824
- What do you think?
- Lend you some of our dust?

402
00:31:57,935 --> 00:32:00,563
Tinker Bell,
we need every bit of it on the mainland.

403
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:04,004
Sweetie, it takes a lot of flying
to bring in autumn.

404
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,240
Sorry, Tink.

405
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:10,672
Say, you know who can help.

406
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:19,215
Raffaela, Renato, Redina, Rina...

407
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,514
- Hi, Cheese!
- Hey, Terence!

408
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,092
Morning, Fawn!

409
00:32:23,494 --> 00:32:26,258
- Rina, Rhoda, Rosetta...
- Terence.

410
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:29,429
- Tink?
- Hi.

411
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,929
Surprised to see you.
How's the scepter?

412
00:32:34,671 --> 00:32:36,605
I'm working on it.

413
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:40,904
Look, Terence, things happened,
mistakes were made,

414
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:44,412
and now there's something
I need to talk to you about.

415
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,943
I need some extra pixie dust.

416
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:52,914
You need more pixie dust?
That's why you're here?

417
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:54,215
Yeah.

418
00:32:54,324 --> 00:32:58,090
It's not exactly what I was expecting.
Why do you need more dust?

419
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:00,891
I... I can't tell you.

420
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:02,997
You can't tell me?

421
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,331
You need more pixie dust,
and you can't tell me why?

422
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:09,132
A true friend
wouldn't need to know why.

423
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:12,308
A true friend wouldn't ask me
to break the rules!

424
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,207
Well, then,
I guess we're not true friends!

425
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:19,743
No, I...

426
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,546
I guess we're not.

427
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:25,783
I'm on my own, then.

428
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:07,352
What?

429
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:49,098
So long, Pixie Hollow. I'll be back soon.

430
00:36:11,555 --> 00:36:14,820
I just need to angle the moon
with the horizon.

431
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,438
Huh?

432
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:18,019
I'm starving.

433
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:24,055
My boysenberry rolls!

434
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:47,417
My mouse cheese!
My pumpernickel muffin!

435
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:52,116
Out. Out. Shoo. Go find your friends.

436
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:03,592
Stop following me.

437
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,797
I'm on a very important mission.

438
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:09,167
I have two days to find the magic mirror
and wish the moonstone back.

439
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,830
No, I don't need any help.

440
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,671
Yes, I am sure. Okay. Now, let's see.

441
00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:22,877
Hey, look! Look, little guy. Fetch!

442
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:28,284
Will you please get out of here?

443
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,699
That does it. Out!

444
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,646
All right. You can stay.

445
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:40,587
For now. Just do me a favor,
if you could stay right here.

446
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:45,764
If my bearings are accurate,
we should see land soon.

447
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,834
I'm Tinker Bell. What's your name?

448
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:53,009
Okay. Blinky?

449
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:58,012
Flicker? Flash? Beam? Flare?

450
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:01,475
Well, how in the blazing bellows
am I supposed to guess your name

451
00:40:01,585 --> 00:40:02,552
if you keep...

452
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:06,617
Your name's Bellows?

453
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,250
Oh, Blaze.

454
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:13,091
Kind of a tough-guy name.
You a tough guy?

455
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:17,523
Okay. Don't hurt yourself.

456
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:21,426
That's it, Cheese.
Keep them coming.

457
00:40:21,805 --> 00:40:22,863
Next.

458
00:40:24,274 --> 00:40:25,605
Okay. Next.

459
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:28,734
Iridessa,
how are those lanterns coming?

460
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:32,941
Almost done, Fairy Mary. Whoa!
Good shot, Cheese.

461
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,178
Next, I'll get Rosetta some light crystals
for the fireworks.

462
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:40,313
I can't wait to mix them up
with my begonias, gardenias and...

463
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,891
- Forget-me-nots.
- Forget-me-nots.

464
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:47,062
I keep forgetting those.

465
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:51,528
Fawn, show me how that
21 -butterfly salute is coming along.

466
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:55,160
All right, fellas, when I blow the whistle,
you guys go.

467
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:58,340
On your mark, get set...

468
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:04,844
One down and 20 to go.

469
00:41:05,682 --> 00:41:09,448
Keep at it, sweetie.
Silvermist, what are you working on?

470
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,713
Pollywog bubbles. Okay, guys.

471
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,388
Ooh!

472
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,929
- There you go.
- Nicely done, dear.

473
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,257
Next.

474
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:27,526
Fireworks. Is it ready yet?

475
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:28,968
- Yes!
- Let her rip!

476
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,835
- Right, Bobble.
- Dear.

477
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:36,206
I'm okay.

478
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,781
Still okay.

479
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,147
Honestly.

480
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,534
One, two.

481
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:04,698
I don't understand, Blaze.
We should've seen land by now.

482
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:10,176
You go ahead and get some rest.
I'll take first watch.

483
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,941
Whoa! I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm...
In a tree?

484
00:42:45,115 --> 00:42:47,276
This must be the lost island.

485
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:51,449
There it is.
The stone arch from the story!

486
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:54,412
You stay here and guard the balloon.

487
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:57,821
I'll be right back.

488
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:16,768
Oh!

489
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,345
Oh, no.

490
00:43:18,448 --> 00:43:22,646
This is supposed to be a rock arch,
not a twisty, branchy, tree arch.

491
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:39,061
Not now.

492
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:46,709
What has gotten into you?

493
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:51,071
Blaze, where's the balloon?

494
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:54,179
It's gone?

495
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:57,250
My compass, my supplies,
my pixie dust.

496
00:43:57,754 --> 00:44:00,655
I left you in charge.
Why didn't you warn me?

497
00:44:02,826 --> 00:44:04,418
Well, I... You...

498
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:09,359
Okay, okay. We'll get back to that later.
We gotta find that balloon.

499
00:44:27,116 --> 00:44:28,242
Blaze!

500
00:44:38,094 --> 00:44:39,152
Tink?

501
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:48,129
- I'm so sorry...
- Terence. Terence. How did you...

502
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:51,765
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

503
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:54,036
- This is your fault!
- Tink, I...

504
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,338
I was just trying to be a good friend. I...

505
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:58,175
Just leave me alone!

506
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,983
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

507
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:11,383
No. Terence, come back. Terence.

508
00:45:12,795 --> 00:45:13,989
Terence.

509
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,203
Blaze, where are you?

510
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,936
Blaze!

511
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:41,981
I lost my balloon. I lost my pixie dust.
I'm starving.

512
00:45:43,393 --> 00:45:44,985
What have I done?

513
00:46:51,527 --> 00:46:55,429
Wow, that hit the spot.
Thank you so much.

514
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:01,327
Hey, we're lost.

515
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:05,839
By any chance, have you seen
a stone arch around here?

516
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:30,195
I'm out of dust.
Looks like I'll be walking from here.

517
00:47:39,575 --> 00:47:40,906
My compass!

518
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:45,839
Ouch!

519
00:47:46,482 --> 00:47:48,347
That is a sharp thingy.

520
00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:50,312
Terence.

521
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:06,333
The stone arch. Blaze, hey, we made it!
We're here!

522
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,866
Thank you so much.

523
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:16,604
Thank you all so much. Bye, now. Bye!

524
00:48:18,748 --> 00:48:21,911
Great to have friends
that will help you out, huh?

525
00:48:28,591 --> 00:48:30,786
I know Tink is my best friend.

526
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:33,861
We should just forgive each other.

527
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:37,421
Someone just needs
to take the first step.

528
00:48:38,034 --> 00:48:39,058
Who?

529
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:42,329
Yeah, well, I think it should be Tink.

530
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:44,835
- Who?
- Tink.

531
00:48:45,374 --> 00:48:47,968
She blamed me
for breaking the scepter.

532
00:48:48,978 --> 00:48:51,469
- Who?
- Tink!

533
00:48:52,048 --> 00:48:53,538
I know she's under a lot of pressure,

534
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:56,447
but she shouldn't
have treated me that way.

535
00:48:56,986 --> 00:48:58,749
She should apologize.

536
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:00,446
Who?

537
00:49:06,262 --> 00:49:07,251
Me.

538
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:10,396
Thank you so much, Mr. Owl.

539
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,266
You know what? You are truly
the wisest of all the creatures.

540
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:21,904
The fellows are making fun
of my kilt again.

541
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:25,445
- Who?
- The guys at the depot!

542
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:27,876
They keep calling it a skirt.

543
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:38,116
Hey, Tink, it's me.

544
00:49:39,095 --> 00:49:43,862
Look, I know you're mad at me, okay,
but there's something I need to tell you.

545
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:46,426
Tink?

546
00:49:52,742 --> 00:49:54,107
Anyone home?

547
00:49:59,148 --> 00:50:00,615
The moonstone.

548
00:50:05,354 --> 00:50:06,412
What?

549
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:23,699
It's our last day, Blaze.
We gotta find that shipwreck soon.

550
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,287
None shall pass
the secret troll bridge.

551
00:50:44,594 --> 00:50:48,052
Troll bridge?
I thought it was "toll bridge."

552
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:51,967
- Look, fellas, I don't want any trouble.
- We are guardians of the secret...

553
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:55,003
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- What?

554
00:50:55,104 --> 00:50:57,902
It's my turn to give
the ominous warning, blockhead.

555
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:59,269
- Is not.
- Is too.

556
00:50:59,408 --> 00:51:03,936
- Is not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not!
- Is too! Is too! Too! Too! Too! Too! Too!

557
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,809
You did it last time.

558
00:51:06,082 --> 00:51:08,880
That was over 300 years ago!

559
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,548
Go ahead.

560
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:16,916
We are guardians of the secret bridge.

561
00:51:17,226 --> 00:51:21,390
Beat it before we grind your bones
to make our bed.

562
00:51:23,132 --> 00:51:24,690
- Bread.
- What?

563
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:31,367
The expression is, "Grind your bones
to make our bread," not "bed."

564
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:33,334
Oh? Really?

565
00:51:34,977 --> 00:51:37,741
Who would want
to make bread out of bones?

566
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,511
Might break a tooth.

567
00:51:39,615 --> 00:51:42,413
Well, who would want to sleep in a bed
made of bones?

568
00:51:42,551 --> 00:51:45,679
It's hard on the back. It'll put a crick
in your neck, you knucklehead.

569
00:51:45,788 --> 00:51:49,019
Lx-nay in front of the ictim-vay.

570
00:51:49,692 --> 00:51:51,284
Gravel for brains.

571
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:52,793
- Fuzz face.
- Thimble head.

572
00:51:52,895 --> 00:51:54,226
- Stinky breath.
- Googly eyes.

573
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,763
- Waxy ears!
- Unibrow!

574
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:57,833
Excuse me. I need to get through.

575
00:51:57,933 --> 00:52:00,333
None shall pass!

576
00:52:00,603 --> 00:52:03,265
Do you have any idea
what I've been through to get here?

577
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:04,771
I almost got attacked by bugs and bats

578
00:52:04,874 --> 00:52:06,307
and got blown all over the place
by the wind,

579
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:09,037
and almost starved to death to find
a mirror that grants one last wish,

580
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:10,169
which I wouldn't have even needed

581
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:12,110
if Terence had taken his time
finding me a sharp thingy

582
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:13,909
instead of making me
break the moonstone.

583
00:52:14,016 --> 00:52:16,041
And then he didn't even share
his pixie dust because he cares more

584
00:52:16,152 --> 00:52:17,881
about the stupid rules
than he does about me...

585
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:20,148
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

586
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:22,952
- Who's Terence?
- Is he a friend of yours?

587
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:24,890
Well, yeah.

588
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:28,260
He was my best friend.

589
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:32,425
- You're not very nice.
- Hey, don't you judge me!

590
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:35,766
You've been yelling at each other
since I got here.

591
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:37,839
But he knows I don't mean it, don't you?

592
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,305
You old softie.

593
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:45,671
- Like when I call you "wart face."
- Yes. Or when I call you "big nose."

594
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:48,714
- Booger breath.
- Stinky feet.

595
00:52:48,818 --> 00:52:50,581
- Weasel toes!
- Badger brain!

596
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,816
- Garden gnome!
- Garden gnome?

597
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:59,823
Oh, dear,
I don't know where that came from.

598
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:04,895
- I crossed the line.
- Say the magic words. Go on.

599
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:09,727
I'm sorry.

600
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,330
- Do you mean it?
- Absolutely.

601
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:14,375
- Do you feel it?
- Deeply.

602
00:53:16,045 --> 00:53:18,946
Well, then, I forgive you.

603
00:53:21,384 --> 00:53:24,182
- Friends?
- Friends.

604
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:30,786
- Come here, buddy.
- Pal!

605
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:32,827
<i>- Amigo.
- Compadre.</i>

606
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:35,061
- You're the best.
- No, you.

607
00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:36,961
- No, you.
- No, you're right, I am the best.

608
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:39,762
- So now you think you're the best?
- I know I'm the best!

609
00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:41,598
Now, don't you argue with me!

610
00:53:41,704 --> 00:53:42,762
Well, you're ugly
and stinky.

611
00:53:42,872 --> 00:53:43,930
Really?

612
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,646
Blaze, listen, it's the ocean.

613
00:54:32,154 --> 00:54:36,853
The ship that sunk but never sank.
Okay, Blaze, this is it.

614
00:54:37,226 --> 00:54:40,491
We gotta find that mirror
and fix the moonstone. Let's go.

615
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:11,217
Why couldn't the mirror
be in a bunny-filled meadow?

616
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,726
Blaze!

617
00:56:33,237 --> 00:56:35,171
Who's that? Who's there?

618
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:05,299
Look, Blaze.

619
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:21,106
Ah!

620
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,459
What do you think? Too big?

621
00:57:39,636 --> 00:57:43,436
It's gotta be in here somewhere, Blaze.
Come on. Help me look.

622
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:10,696
It's real.

623
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:24,406
Okay. Deep breath.

624
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:29,541
Clear your mind.
Only get one shot at this. Here it goes.

625
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:33,679
I wish... I wish...

626
00:58:35,259 --> 00:58:36,590
I wish...

627
00:58:38,996 --> 00:58:41,863
Blaze, I wish you'd be quiet
for one minute!

628
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:50,435
No, no, no, no! No!
That one didn't count!

629
00:58:50,908 --> 00:58:53,843
I take it back.
Please, please. I take it back!

630
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:56,037
That wasn't my wish. Please!

631
00:58:57,948 --> 00:59:00,109
Blaze, look what you've done!

632
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:04,487
This mirror was my last chance.
This is all your fault!

633
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,232
I'm sorry, Blaze. It's not your fault.

634
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,308
It's mine.

635
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,716
It's all mine.

636
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:43,893
I wish Terence were here.

637
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:47,256
I wish we were still friends.

638
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:52,797
We are friends, Tink.

639
00:59:54,705 --> 00:59:55,899
Terence.

640
00:59:57,107 --> 01:00:00,736
- I am so sorry.
- I forgive you.

641
01:00:02,546 --> 01:00:04,241
I miss you so much.

642
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:08,874
I miss you, too. But, Tink, why...

643
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:12,684
Why didn't you tell me
about the moonstone?

644
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:15,584
I didn't want anyone to know.

645
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:18,690
I didn't think
I needed any help, Terence.

646
01:00:19,062 --> 01:00:21,860
I was wrong. I wish you were here.

647
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,700
- I am here.
- I know you are.

648
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:29,736
But, I mean, really here, with me.

649
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:32,808
I am with you.

650
01:00:33,043 --> 01:00:36,911
No. I mean here, Terence,
right next to me.

651
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:39,645
I'm standing behind you.

652
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:42,045
Terence!

653
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:47,856
I'm so sorry, Terence.
I know, I was so wrong...

654
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,926
Hey, hey. I'm sorry, too.

655
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,652
You know, you were under
a lot of pressure... Whoa! Hey.

656
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:56,592
- Who's this?
- This is Blaze.

657
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,600
He's been a big help
in some tough spots.

658
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:01,637
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- How did you...

659
01:01:01,738 --> 01:01:04,138
I flew all night and all day over the sea,

660
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:06,209
and just when I was gonna
run out of dust,

661
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,335
I stumbled
into that flying machine of yours.

662
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:09,673
That thing is awesome!

663
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,476
I only had a pinch of dust left.
It got me all the way here.

664
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:14,072
You found my balloon?

665
01:01:14,184 --> 01:01:16,744
But where did you even get the dust
to make it this far?

666
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:19,515
I, you know, borrowed a little extra.

667
01:01:20,023 --> 01:01:24,892
- You broke the rules for me?
- Hey, I knew you needed my help.

668
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:30,023
Run!

669
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:42,070
Blaze!

670
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:12,802
Hold on!

671
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:35,687
- That was kind of fun.
- What?

672
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:42,733
There's our way out.

673
01:02:49,045 --> 01:02:51,513
Terence, buy me some time.
Come on, Blaze.

674
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:03,693
Back, you dirty rats!

675
01:03:32,589 --> 01:03:34,750
- Are they gone?
- They're gone.

676
01:03:41,031 --> 01:03:42,259
Let's go.

677
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:45,497
Come here, you vicious monster.

678
01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:59,115
Now, how are we
gonna fly this thing?

679
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:01,241
I used the last of my dust
getting it here.

680
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:03,182
Well, with any luck,
my pixie-dust bag

681
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:05,049
should be around here somewhere.

682
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:07,522
Is it enough?

683
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:11,893
- Yeah, it's enough. Anchors up.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

684
01:04:13,897 --> 01:04:17,924
Just a little bit of pixie dust up front
will get this baby going.

685
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:21,504
That should do the trick.

686
01:04:21,805 --> 01:04:22,897
Whoa!

687
01:04:25,609 --> 01:04:26,633
Wow.

688
01:04:27,077 --> 01:04:29,671
I guess it pays
to have a dust-keeper fairy around.

689
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:32,441
I'm telling you, we just might make it.

690
01:04:34,084 --> 01:04:36,052
Hey, are you okay?

691
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,811
What's gonna happen
when we get back?

692
01:04:40,457 --> 01:04:43,324
Would you happen to have
an extra moonstone?

693
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:52,564
I don't know if it's gonna help,
but I brought this.

694
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:56,870
My scepter.

695
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,319
Hey, I've got an idea.

696
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:17,616
- Terence?
- Right. Right.

697
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:19,791
No, I know. You need your space.

698
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:23,354
No. I can't do this without you.
Would you help me?

699
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:24,825
Sure.

700
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:28,569
If I turn this, then this can go in here.

701
01:05:28,672 --> 01:05:30,469
Wait a second.
You think this would work?

702
01:05:30,574 --> 01:05:32,838
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Okay, okay.

703
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:34,205
Set it at a 30-degree angle

704
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:36,211
so that the reflective qualities
of the moonstone...

705
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:38,941
Are magnified in relation
to the moonbeam rays.

706
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:40,812
Yes! You're a genius.

707
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:46,581
- I almost got it. I just need...
- Like a sharp thingy?

708
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:48,649
Yeah.

709
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,952
Excuse me, Blaze.

710
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:25,057
That's a bit heavier than I remember.

711
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:33,129
1,492, 1,493...

712
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:34,260
No, no, no.

713
01:06:34,371 --> 01:06:37,431
It's all right.
Tink will be here any second now.

714
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,735
The blue harvest moon is high.

715
01:06:40,377 --> 01:06:42,971
The moonbeams
are almost at their mark.

716
01:06:43,413 --> 01:06:45,108
This is a disaster.

717
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:48,479
Fairy Mary, where is Tinker Bell?

718
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:50,047
- I don't know!
- You...

719
01:06:50,153 --> 01:06:51,814
Minister, Fairy Mary?

720
01:06:51,921 --> 01:06:53,616
Yes, Your Highness?

721
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:54,815
Is anything the matter?

722
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:56,915
- Yes...
- No, Your Highness.

723
01:06:57,193 --> 01:06:59,684
- Where is Tinker Bell?
- Well, we've been...

724
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:00,990
Whoa! Look up there!

725
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,198
Tinker Bell!

726
01:07:06,836 --> 01:07:08,303
Hi, everybody!

727
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:10,002
- Wow!
- Wow!

728
01:07:14,778 --> 01:07:18,236
Hi! Queen Clarion, Fairy Mary,
I made it!

729
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:22,106
- There she is.
- Now that's an entrance.

730
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:25,120
Right in the nick of time.

731
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:37,499
Your Highness.

732
01:07:38,635 --> 01:07:41,263
Tinker Bell,
at the beginning of the season,

733
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:44,397
you were entrusted
with a great responsibility.

734
01:07:45,408 --> 01:07:47,399
Where is the fall scepter?

735
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:50,470
There were complications,

736
01:07:51,848 --> 01:07:54,248
but it's ready now, Your Highness.

737
01:07:54,684 --> 01:07:56,174
This way, dear.

738
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,661
Fairies of Pixie Hollow,
I present the autumn scepter.

739
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:17,200
The moonstone! One, two...

740
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:23,906
No, no, no. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
Just... Just wait.

741
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:27,114
Wait, wait.

742
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:29,109
Come on, come on.

743
01:08:29,385 --> 01:08:31,979
Please work. Please work. Please work.

744
01:08:54,511 --> 01:08:58,880
Your Majesty, I've never seen
this much blue pixie dust before.

745
01:08:59,048 --> 01:09:00,208
Indeed.

746
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:05,250
It's at least a million smidges.
Maybe more.

747
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:09,514
- It's more.
- Yeah. Much more.

748
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,018
This is amazing!

749
01:09:14,531 --> 01:09:17,295
- Only Tinker Bell.
- Pretty good, huh?

750
01:09:18,234 --> 01:09:20,498
Come on, girls. It's show time.

751
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:24,364
Fairies
of Pixie Hollow,

752
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:28,570
we have celebrated this revelry
without interruption for centuries.

753
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,840
Tonight, I believe,
is our finest revelry ever,

754
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:37,614
thanks to one very special fairy,
Tinker Bell.

755
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:42,748
And her friend, Terence.

756
01:09:44,494 --> 01:09:46,792
- And her new friend.
- Blaze.

757
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:51,333
Yes, of course. Blaze.
We owe them all our thanks.

758
01:09:56,739 --> 01:10:00,072
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you, Fairy Mary.

759
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:02,902
What made you think
of breaking the moonstone

760
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:05,446
into all those tiny little pieces?

761
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:07,075
Genius!

762
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:11,583
On your lead, my dear.

763
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:17,389
All right, everyone.
To the pixie-dust tree!

764
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:26,891
That's our cue!

765
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:36,870
There are the bubbles. Hit it, Clank.

766
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:43,513
It worked, Bobble! It worked!

767
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:46,280
Aye, it certainly did.

768
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:55,491
<i>To believe in who you are</i>

769
01:10:55,899 --> 01:11:00,393
<i>Who you were always meant to be</i>

770
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:05,239
<i>To you open up your heart</i>

771
01:11:05,842 --> 01:11:10,006
<i>Then you set your spirit free</i>

772
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:15,040
<i>In this time of the season</i>

773
01:11:15,351 --> 01:11:19,583
<i>Every leaf on every tree</i>

774
01:11:20,123 --> 01:11:22,318
<i>Start to shine</i>

775
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,684
<i>Come and see</i>

776
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:27,089
<i>Take my hand</i>

777
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,127
<i>Come with me</i>

778
01:11:29,265 --> 01:11:34,669
<i>And fly</i>

779
01:11:39,676 --> 01:11:42,372
<i>"The greatest treasures
are not gold</i>

780
01:11:42,478 --> 01:11:45,038
<i>"Nor jewels, nor works of art</i>

781
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:50,282
<i>"They cannot be held in your hands
They're held within your heart</i>

782
01:11:51,187 --> 01:11:56,386
<i>"For worldly things will fade away
as seasons come and go</i>

783
01:11:57,093 --> 01:12:02,554
<i>"But the treasure of true friendship
will never lose its glow"</i>

784
01:12:26,356 --> 01:12:30,349
<i>Sometimes you think
you'll be fine by yourself</i>

785
01:12:30,727 --> 01:12:35,289
<i>'Cause a dream
is a wish that you make all alone</i>

786
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:39,930
<i>It's easy to feel like you don't need help</i>

787
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:44,071
<i>But it's harder to walk on your own</i>

788
01:12:44,707 --> 01:12:48,905
<i>You'll change inside</i>

789
01:12:49,379 --> 01:12:53,213
<i>When you realize</i>

790
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:55,647
<i>The world comes to life</i>

01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:58,414

794
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:07,757
<i>That helps you to find</i>

795
01:13:08,564 --> 01:13:12,625
<i>The beauty you are
when you open your heart</i>

797

<i>The gift of a friend</i>

799
01:13:27,683 --> 01:13:31,983
<i>Someone who knows
when your lost and you're scared</i>

800
01:13:32,388 --> 01:13:36,324
<i>There through
the highs and the lows</i>

801
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:41,326
<i>Someone to count on
Someone who cares</i>

802
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:45,333
<i>Beside you wherever you'll go</i>

803
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:50,201
<i>You'll change inside</i>

804
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:54,437
<i>When you realize</i>

Shattering to the ground</i>

<i>You'll feel all alone</i>

815

<i>When you don't know which way to go</i>

816
01:14:35,952 --> 01:14:39,649

01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:01,200

<i>You believe in</i>

826
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:14,481
<i>When you believe in</i>

827
01:15:14,824 --> 01:15:18,692
<i>When you believe in</i>

828
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:23,462
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

829
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:56,796
<i>Where the sunbeams play
in the highland glade</i>

830
01:15:57,166 --> 01:16:01,398
<i>Where the leaves are gently falling</i>

831
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:08,244
<i>Where we used to dance
in the autumn shade</i>

832
01:16:08,778 --> 01:16:13,806
<i>My foolish pride drove you away</i>

833
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:19,990
<i>Where the storm clouds rose
and the cold winds blew</i>

834
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:24,525
<i>Oh, I could not hear you calling</i>

835
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:31,290
<i>Till you took my hand
and you pulled me through</i>

836
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:36,270
<i>To where the sunbeams play</i>

837
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:42,170
<i>To ride with you
upon the wind</i>

838
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:47,450
<i>To fly above the sea</i>

839
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:53,145
<i>To be far and wide
of Neverland</i>

840
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,450
<i>I would dare to go</i>

841
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,460
<i>If you would go with me</i>

842
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:06,065
<i>Now the wind blows our love
against our day</i>

843
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:11,265
<i>And the dark of night is falling</i>

844
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:15,000
<i>But if you're with me</i>

845
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,980
<i>We will find our way</i>

846
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:25,330
<i>To where the sunbeams
To where the sunbeams</i>

847
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:30,155
<i>To where the sunbeams dance</i>

848
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:36,400
<i>And play</i>

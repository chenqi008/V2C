1
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:48,456
(BEGIN)

2
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,490
The changing
of the seasons

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,500
brings wonder to the world

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,870
For ages has the magic
of the fairies been unfurled

5
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,910
But nature's greatest changes
come beneath the autumn sky

6
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:07,115
and mysteries reveal themselves
as harvest time draws nigh

7
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:13,120
This year, a shimmering blue moon
will rise before the frost

8
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:18,685
Perhaps its rays can light the way
to find what has been lost

9
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,100
Time to turn the maple
brilliant crimson

10
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:43,385
Time to turn the Aspen
sparkling gold

11
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,620
Time to tumble apples
from their branches

12
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:51,785
Time to tell
the breezes crisp and cold

13
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,390
A chilling

14
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,100
Folds the countryside

15
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,135
Kiss of morning mist
upon the meadow

16
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:14,375
Scent of wood smoke
swirling in the air

17
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:18,784
Signals that it's high time
for the harvest

18
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:23,020
Every pumpkin, peach
and prickly pear

19
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:30,000
With ripened fruit to bear

20
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:32,965
If you believe

21
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:35,131
In who you are

22
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,500
Who you were
always meant to be

23
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:45,042
If you open up your heart

24
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,050
Then you set your spirit free

25
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:54,822
In this time of the season

26
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:59,159
Every leaf on every tree

27
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:01,824
Will start to shine

28
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:04,002
Come and see

29
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,529
Take my hand

30
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,864
Come with me

31
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:14,173
And fly

32
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:21,246
Oh! Oh!

33
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,256
Yeah, okay. There you go!

34
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:26,922
No, no, no!

35
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:33,892
Good job.

36
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:42,335
In this time of the season

37
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:47,071
Every leaf on every tree

38
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,607
Will start to shine

39
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:52,174
Come and see

40
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,442
Take my hand

41
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:58,789
Come with me

42
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:03,260
And fly

43
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,596
Morning, Stone.
Hey, Terence.

44
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,394
Come on, let's go. Flap your wings!

45
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:47,199
Those fairies on the mainland
won't be able to fly without pixie dust!

46
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:50,605
Terence, have you delivered
the pixie-dust rations to the scouts yet?

47
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,177
Yep. Finished today's
and half of tomorrow's.

48
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:58,045
Remember, one cup each.
No more, no less.

49
00:04:58,684 --> 00:05:00,379
I know, Fairy Gary.

50
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,228
Well, that's my cue.
I'll catch you guys later.

51
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,539
And where are you off to?

52
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:24,302
Just doing some errands and stuff.

53
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:29,647
Errands!
And stuff!

54
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:31,943
Why are you guys talking like that?

55
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,314
No reason.

56
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:39,421
All right.
Say hi to Tinker Bell, would you?

57
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:40,583
What?

58
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:44,627
Very funny.

59
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,958
All right, you got me.
I'm gonna help Tink again.

60
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,128
Is it okay if I take this?
Sure.

61
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,932
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

62
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:03,841
Hammer.

63
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:18,687
Thanks. Okay, try it now, Cheese.

64
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,128
Yeah, that's it!
Keep going. Keep going!

65
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:27,666
Hey, Cheese.
Special delivery for Tinker Bell.

66
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,400
Hi, Terence.

67
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:32,375
Who's your best friend
that always delivers?

68
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:33,633
Hmm.

69
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:36,213
Iridessa?
Nope. Try again.

70
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,213
Fawn?
Me!

71
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:41,343
Just kidding.

72
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:44,513
So, what do you think
of the Pixie Dust Express?

73
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,521
Wow. The guys are gonna love this
back at the depot,

74
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:51,856
and it sure is going to help out
on the river-outpost deliveries.

75
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,761
Hey, is that a stretchy thingy?

76
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:56,925
Yeah, I thought you could use it
for your motor.

77
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,230
I think it's gonna be perfect.

78
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:08,103
Clip.

79
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,887
All right, Cheese, ready to launch.

80
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:18,616
Aah!

81
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:22,490
It floats!

82
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,299
Okay. Are you ready
for the official test run?

83
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,133
Don't worry. I'll be right next to you.

84
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:32,794
All set?
Check.

85
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,370
Let her rip.

86
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:41,838
Whoa.

87
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,349
And now for hydro-drive.

88
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,185
Sorry.

89
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:58,754
Whoa!

90
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:00,891
Oh, no!

91
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:14,503
Hmm.

92
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,878
Ooh!

93
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:36,832
Are you okay?
Yeah. Thanks.

94
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:40,667
I can't believe the boat broke.

95
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:44,333
I guess your guys
are gonna have to wait a little longer.

96
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:45,932
I'm impressed.

97
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:49,673
Usually when one of your inventions
doesn't work out, you overreact,

98
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,874
but I must say,
you're handling this one pretty well.

99
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,713
I drove it into a tree?
Never mind.

100
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,382
Jingles!

101
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:01,481
I made it to help you, Terence.
It should've worked.

102
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,060
Come on.
Look, it just needs a little tinkering.

103
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:10,191
Let's see.
Who do I know who's a good tinker?

104
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:13,068
Bobble. Bobble's a good tinker.

105
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:16,072
Or Fairy Mary,
she's got a lot of experience.

106
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:17,968
Or... Hey, what about Clank?

107
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,747
Uh-oh.

108
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:26,942
Someone's in trouble.
Hey, I haven't done anything, lately.

109
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:28,817
The stinkbug incident?

110
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,282
Oh, no.

111
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:34,425
Tinker Bell, Queen Clarion awaits.

112
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,929
It's all
a big misunderstanding.

113
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:44,365
I'm sure the queen wants to see me
about something completely unrelated.

114
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,901
One moment.

115
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:53,168
Tinker Bell is here.
She's waiting outside, my lady.

116
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,870
Thank you, Viola.

117
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,772
Fairy Mary, are you certain?
Whatever do you mean?

118
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:02,820
Only that Tinker Bell,
while undoubtedly talented, also...

119
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:06,152
Is a hothead? Flies off the handle?
Well, yes.

120
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:08,818
I believe she deserves a chance,
Minister.

121
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:12,192
After all, tinker fairies
learn from their mistakes.

122
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,563
Very well.

123
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:18,025
Agreed. Tinker Bell!

124
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,000
Fairy Mary tells me she knows...

125
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:31,310
It's not my fault, Your Highness!
Those stinkbugs were asking for it.

126
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:39,879
This isn't about the stinkbugs, is it?
No.

127
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:42,516
But we can certainly
come back to that later.

128
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:43,685
Mary.

129
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,325
You do know the Minister of Autumn.

130
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:49,263
My dear.
Hi.

131
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:52,697
Are you familiar
with the great autumn revelry?

132
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:56,205
Well, everyone's talking about it.
They're so excited.

133
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:58,499
Since time immemorial,

134
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,807
fairies have celebrated
the end of autumn with a revelry,

135
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:07,215
and this particular autumn
coincides with a blue harvest moon.

136
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:11,314
A new scepter must be created
to celebrate the occasion.

137
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:15,851
Behold, the Hall of Scepters.

138
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:23,393
They're beautiful.
Every scepter is unique.

139
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,202
Some are the work of animal fairies,

140
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:29,967
some of light fairies, or water fairies,
or garden fairies.

141
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:34,003
This year,
it is the turn of the tinker fairies.

142
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:37,513
And Fairy Mary has recommended you.

143
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,147
Me? But I'm... I'm...
A very talented tinker.

144
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,851
The scepter must be built
to precise dimensions.

145
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,725
At the top, you will place a moonstone.

146
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,363
When the blue moon is at its peak,

147
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:01,667
its rays will pass through the gem,
creating blue pixie dust.

148
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:06,102
The blue pixie dust
restores the pixie dust tree.

149
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:10,947
Like autumn itself,
it signals rebirth and rejuvenation.

150
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,508
We are relying on you.

151
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:16,276
This way, dear.

152
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,421
Here is the moonstone.

153
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:25,029
It has been handed down
from generation to generation.

154
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,358
Be careful. It is ridiculously fragile.

155
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:34,631
Fairy Mary, I... I don't know what to say.

156
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:38,370
Thank you!
Careful, Tinker Bell! Fragile!

157
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:41,877
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

158
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:47,885
Why are you counting?
It helps to calm me down.

159
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:53,490
Got it. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
I'll make you proud, all of you.

160
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,957
Yahoo!

161
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:04,826
Tink!

162
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:07,462
Tink?

163
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:10,631
Hey!

164
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,747
So?

165
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:18,440
Terence, you're never
gonna believe this.

166
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,383
Guess what happened! Go on, guess!

167
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,009
Well, I...

168
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:26,284
I have been picked
to make the new fall scepter!

169
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,452
Me! Me!

170
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:32,257
Hey, that means they...
They gave you the moonstone?

171
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:33,922
Yeah! Want to see?

172
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:43,164
Not so close. Don't breathe on it.
It's fragile.

173
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,108
Yeah, I know. I know all about it.

174
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:49,804
The blue moon only rises
in Pixie Hollow every eight years.

175
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,940
The trajectory of the light beam's gotta
match the curvature of the moonstone

176
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,450
at a 90-degree angle

177
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,543
so the light can transmute
into pixie dust.

178
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:59,782
Wow, Terence!
Now, how'd you know all that?

179
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:04,084
Well, you know, every dust-keeper's
gotta study dustology.

180
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:06,026
Hey! You know what this calls for?

181
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,996
Two cups of...
Chamomile tea.

182
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:10,363
With extra honey and...
And some milkweed whip.

183
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,371
Hey, by the way, that new
bucket-and-pulley system you made?

184
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:17,202
Fairy Gary loves it.

185
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,969
He's so cute.
Lf you say so.

186
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:25,111
You know what? Maybe I can help you.
You know, I'm kind of an expert on this.

187
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:28,242
I can collect the supplies
and give you advice.

188
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:33,281
You will? That's... That's so sweet.
Hey, what are friends for?

189
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:36,486
So, what do you say?
Can I be your wingman?

190
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:37,959
That would be great.

191
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:40,623
The best dust-keeper fairy.
And the best tinker!

192
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:42,996
This is gonna be
a revelry to remember.

193
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:51,339
Knock-knock.

194
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:56,411
Morning.
Hi.

195
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:02,208
All right, we have one full moon
until the autumn revelry. Here we go.

196
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,687
Hey, Tink!
I brought you some stuff from work.

197
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:08,850
Whoa.

198
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,654
Wow, Terence, how did you...

199
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:16,197
I love this thing!

200
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,895
I can tell you're gonna be a big help.

201
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:21,096
Looks good.

202
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:23,265
Now, remember,
you get the most blue pixie dust

203
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:26,309
if you maximize the moonstone's
exposed surface area.

204
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:27,673
Right. Got it.

205
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,216
Knock-knickity-knock!

206
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:40,690
Out of bed, sleepyhead.

207
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,620
You gotta keep the fire nice and hot.

208
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:05,949
Excuse me, Tink.

209
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,747
Yeah, you know, you should
really keep that workspace clean.

210
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:13,654
Okay, let me just...
Let me get that one right there.

211
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:19,224
Just one more. Thank you.

212
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,298
Whoa!
One, two, three...

213
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,457
Why are you counting?
...four...

214
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:29,568
Knickity-knickity-knock!
Knickity-knock!

215
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:34,909
Watch your angle there.

216
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,403
Knock-knock!
Who's there?

217
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:02,764
Knock. Knock who?
Knock-knock-knickity-knock!

218
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:04,532
Knickity-knock.

219
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:37,434
Steady.

220
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:41,041
You gotta be easy.
This is the tricky part.

221
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,240
I know.

222
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:47,741
All right, now we gotta match
the trajectory of the light beam

223
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,843
with the...
Got it. Thanks.

224
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:51,444
With the...
Okay. Yeah, I know.

225
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:52,887
With the...
Shh!

226
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:58,658
The curvature of the moonstone.
Will you please...

227
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:11,532
Tink, it looks like you need
some sort of, you know, sharp thingy.

228
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,769
That's exactly what I need.

229
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:17,710
Could you go out
and find me something sharp?

230
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:20,079
You got it. I'll be right back.

231
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:21,785
Take your time.

232
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:32,193
Clank, what is that?

233
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:37,498
This is a fireworks launcher.
Allow me to demonstrate.

234
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:42,335
Iridessa and Rosetta will mix
light crystals with flower pigment.

235
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,005
The mixture will go into the launcher,
like so.

236
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:49,174
Then I tighten the spring, like so.

237
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,005
Oh, dear. Clank...
Then you throw the trigger...

238
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,243
Yes, Clank...
...and the fireworks shoot into the air!

239
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,910
Clank!
Like so!

240
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,215
Clanky, that's brilliant!

241
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:06,753
Hey, Bobble. Listen, do you know
where I can find a sharp thingy?

242
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,666
A sharp thingy?
How about a stick?

243
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:16,301
No, a sharp thingy-majigy.
A stick can be pretty sharp!

244
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:19,772
No, I need something sharper
to help Tink.

245
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:21,535
For Tink!

246
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:25,673
Clank, don't sneak up on me like that.
Did you try the cove?

247
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,284
Of course! That's where
all the lost things wash up.

248
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:33,483
Thanks, Bobble. Thanks, Clank.
Our pleasure. So long, Terence!

249
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,619
I'm getting a little dizzy.

250
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:39,389
Uh-oh.

251
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:50,768
Perfect.

252
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:55,970
And now for the finishing touch,
a spattering of silver shavings.

253
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:02,377
Steady. I can't wait till she sees this.

254
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:07,248
Oh!

255
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:19,926
There. Perfect.

256
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:23,367
Finally.
Hey, Tink! I'm back!

257
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,774
What is this?
It's your sharp thingy.

258
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:33,974
My... That's not...

259
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:37,180
One, two, three, four...

260
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:41,853
Terence, this is not sharp.
This is round.

261
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,161
It is, in fact, the exact opposite of sharp.

262
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:49,724
Really, look, if you look inside, it's...
I need to work, okay?

263
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:53,296
Now, would you please
get this thing out of here?

264
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:03,744
My scepter!

265
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:09,982
Tink, I'm so sorry. I...

266
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:13,585
Out, Terence! Just go!
What?

267
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:17,719
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

268
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:20,093
This is your fault!
Tink, I...

269
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:24,926
I was just trying to be a good friend. I...
Go away! Just leave me alone!

270
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,734
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

271
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:50,417
Ow! Ow! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

272
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,155
No.

273
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:20,514
Kept her workspace clean,
brought her food, stoked the fire!

274
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:23,659
Find a sharp thingy.
Searched high and low,

275
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,021
and she didn't even say thank you!

276
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:32,961
Whoa.

277
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:44,837
I know some rock fairies
that are gonna be pretty upset.

278
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,048
What? There are no rock fairies.

279
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:51,551
You never know. There might be.

280
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,223
Are you okay?

281
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:57,217
Yeah, I'm great! Why do you ask?

282
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:03,158
I'm... No. I'm sorry.
I... I had a fight with Tink.

283
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,702
What happened?

284
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:10,440
There was just an accident,
and she just... She just exploded. I...

285
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:12,408
She exploded?

286
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:14,572
No, no, I don't mean like that.

287
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,079
I mean, she just yelled at me,
you know? And...

288
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:18,239
Oh!

289
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:21,511
Did she turn red?

290
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,348
Well, of course she turned red!
It's Tink!

291
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:26,923
Just give her a chance to cool off.

292
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:30,719
Yeah, you're probably right.

293
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:56,582
Hello, Tink!
Clank! Bobble!

294
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:59,788
Came to see if you wanted to join us
for fairytale theater.

295
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,949
We figure you could use
a real break.

296
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,755
Break? Nothing's broken!
What do you mean?

297
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,454
What do you know?

298
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:08,323
Sorry, fellas. Busy.

299
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:11,162
You know, the revelry,
fall scepter, whatnot.

300
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,634
I can't wait to see that scepter!

301
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,904
Try.
Is it as beautiful as I imagine?

302
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:19,301
Uh...

303
00:24:19,477 --> 00:24:22,412
No.
Terence told us it's amazing.

304
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:25,107
We're so proud of you.

305
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:30,717
Look, guys, I really don't have time.
Well, not to worry, Tink.

306
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:33,346
We'll tell Fairy Mary
you couldn't make it.

307
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:35,391
Fairy Mary?
Well, sure!

308
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:38,621
You know her.
She never misses fairytale theater.

309
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:40,691
Bye-bye!

310
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:47,595
Clank! Bobble! Wait for me!

311
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,411
Fairy Mary, I...

312
00:24:57,515 --> 00:25:00,746
Tinker Bell!
I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

313
00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:03,247
Have you finished the scepter?

314
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:05,888
Well, not exactly.

315
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:09,693
I... I was wondering...
I mean, I have to ask you...

316
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:11,552
Yes?

317
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:13,591
It's about the moonstone.

318
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:17,691
What happened to it? You didn't lose it.
Tell me you didn't lose it!

319
00:25:17,802 --> 00:25:20,430
I didn't lose it.
Good.

320
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:24,440
But I was thinking, if using one
moonstone creates blue pixie dust,

321
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:26,908
using two would create even more.

322
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:29,012
Do you have another moonstone?

323
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:33,277
That moonstone is the only one found
in the last 100 years.

324
00:25:33,718 --> 00:25:35,481
And thank goodness we found it.

325
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:39,044
Without the blue dust,
the pixie dust tree would grow weak,

326
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:42,353
and things would be pretty tough
around here, believe you me.

327
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,620
Are you okay? You look sort of pale.

328
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:51,991
Wait. I know what's going on.
You do?

329
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:57,036
You've been working too hard.
What you need is a little theater.

330
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:01,444
Knowing you, you'd probably redo
the whole scepter if you could.

331
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:04,445
Is that an option?
Tinker Bell!

332
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,344
How exciting!

333
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:46,886
Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!
Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!

334
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:53,362
'T is the moment for ancient fairy lore
'T is the moment for ancient fairy lore

335
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:56,299
Tinker Bell, do you mind?

336
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:00,233
Sorry. Skunk training.

337
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,169
Hush, fairies! Hush!
Hush, fairies! Hush!

338
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:09,179
For a fairytale of yore!
For a fairytale of yore!

339
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,949
'Twas a distant fall

340
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:19,983
when a pirate ship
arrived in Neverland.

341
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,356
The dreaded pirates swarmed ashore,

342
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:28,461
seeking the greatest
and most elusive prize of all.

343
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,293
A fairy.

344
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:33,536
Pirates give me the willies!

345
00:27:33,637 --> 00:27:37,573
Far and wide, the pirates searched
until they found a fairy.

346
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,607
They chased her, captured her

347
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:44,238
and forced her to lead them
to the most magical treasure,

348
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:47,346
the enchanted Mirror of Incanta.

349
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:56,088
Forged by fairy magic in ages past,

350
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:59,893
the mirror had the power
to grant three wishes,

351
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:02,862
anything precious to your heart.

352
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,903
Fairy Mary, is this true?
Every word.

353
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,835
The pirates used two wishes,

354
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:13,272
but before they could use
the third wish,

355
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:18,411
the ship was wrecked
on an island north of Neverland.

356
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:24,777
The Mirror of Incanta,
with its last remaining wish,

357
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:28,556
was lost forever.

358
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:38,496
Yet it is said that the clues to find it
are hidden in this ancient chant.

359
00:28:39,703 --> 00:28:42,934
Journey due north past Neverland

360
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:47,308
Till a faraway island is close at hand

361
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:51,880
When you're alone
But not alone

362
00:28:52,116 --> 00:28:58,385
You will find help
And an arch of stone

363
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:00,790
Arch of stone.

364
00:29:03,294 --> 00:29:06,627
There's one way across
the isle's north ridge

365
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:10,594
But a price must be paid
at the old troll bridge

366
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:12,491
What did she say?

367
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:14,696
I think she said something
about a toll bridge.

368
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:16,170
Toll bridge?
Yeah.

369
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:18,798
But I don't know how much it costs.
Oh?

370
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:23,011
At journey's end
You shall walk the plank

371
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:27,951
Of the ship that sunk
But never sank

372
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:33,088
And in the hold
Amidst gems and gold

373
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:40,119
A wish come true
Awaits, we're told

374
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:54,335
But beware and be warned
There's a trick to this clue

375
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:59,708
Wish only goodwill
Or no good will come you

376
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:02,308
For the treasure you seek

377
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:09,815
You may yet come to rue!

378
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:17,358
Bravo! Bravo!

379
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:21,834
Bravo! Bravo!

380
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:26,170
Faraway island is close at hand

381
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:33,982
Due north past Neverland

382
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,558
Let's see. Mouse cheese.

383
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:45,217
Um...

384
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:46,796
Pan. Chart.

385
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:50,333
Extra clothes.

386
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:55,898
This one's not for traveling.

387
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,935
How am I gonna carry all this?

388
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:02,836
Not enough.

389
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:07,012
There you go. One cup, dear.
Thank you.

390
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,612
Fairy Gary. Hi.

391
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,648
Hello, Tink. What brings you here?

392
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,289
I see that bucket-and-pulley system
I rigged for you is working out.

393
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:19,453
You know, Fairy Gary,
you really run a tight ship.

394
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:23,693
I know it sounds like I'm just saying it,
but you really do. Really.

395
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,266
That's very sweet, dear.

396
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:29,829
Anyway, I was wondering,
can I have some extra pixie dust?

397
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:33,468
Pardon?

398
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:36,876
Come on, Fairy Gary. Please?
Just a smidge?

399
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:41,041
Now, Tinker Bell, you know the rules,

400
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:45,382
and it says here
you already got your ration.

401
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,623
Iridessa! Rosetta!

402
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:57,824
What do you think?
Lend you some of our dust?

403
00:31:57,935 --> 00:32:00,563
Tinker Bell,
we need every bit of it on the mainland.

404
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:04,004
Sweetie, it takes a lot of flying
to bring in autumn.

405
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,240
Sorry, Tink.

406
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:10,672
Say, you know who can help.

407
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:19,215
Raffaela, Renato, Redina, Rina...

408
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,514
Hi, Cheese!
Hey, Terence!

409
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,092
Morning, Fawn!

410
00:32:23,494 --> 00:32:26,258
Rina, Rhoda, Rosetta...
Terence.

411
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:29,429
Tink?
Hi.

412
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,929
Surprised to see you.
How's the scepter?

413
00:32:34,671 --> 00:32:36,605
I'm working on it.

414
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:40,904
Look, Terence, things happened,
mistakes were made,

415
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:44,412
and now there's something
I need to talk to you about.

416
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,943
I need some extra pixie dust.

417
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:52,914
You need more pixie dust?
That's why you're here?

418
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:54,215
Yeah.

419
00:32:54,324 --> 00:32:58,090
It's not exactly what I was expecting.
Why do you need more dust?

420
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:00,891
I... I can't tell you.

421
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:02,997
You can't tell me?

422
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,331
You need more pixie dust,
and you can't tell me why?

423
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:09,132
A true friend
wouldn't need to know why.

424
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:12,308
A true friend wouldn't ask me
to break the rules!

425
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,207
Well, then,
I guess we're not true friends!

426
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:19,743
No, I...

427
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,546
I guess we're not.

428
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:25,783
I'm on my own, then.

429
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:07,352
What?

430
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:49,098
So long, Pixie Hollow. I'll be back soon.

431
00:36:11,555 --> 00:36:14,820
I just need to angle the moon
with the horizon.

432
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,438
Huh?

433
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:18,019
I'm starving.

434
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:24,055
My boysenberry rolls!

435
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:47,417
My mouse cheese!
My pumpernickel muffin!

436
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:52,116
Out. Out. Shoo. Go find your friends.

437
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:03,592
Stop following me.

438
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,797
I'm on a very important mission.

439
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:09,167
I have two days to find the magic mirror
and wish the moonstone back.

440
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,830
No, I don't need any help.

441
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,671
Yes, I am sure. Okay. Now, let's see.

442
00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:22,877
Hey, look! Look, little guy. Fetch!

443
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:28,284
Will you please get out of here?

444
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,699
That does it. Out!

445
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,646
All right. You can stay.

446
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:40,587
For now. Just do me a favor,
if you could stay right here.

447
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:45,764
If my bearings are accurate,
we should see land soon.

448
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,834
I'm Tinker Bell. What's your name?

449
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:53,009
Okay. Blinky?

450
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:58,012
Flicker? Flash? Beam? Flare?

451
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:01,475
Well, how in the blazing bellows
am I supposed to guess your name

452
00:40:01,585 --> 00:40:02,552
if you keep...

453
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:06,617
Your name's Bellows?

454
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,250
Oh, Blaze.

455
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:13,091
Kind of a tough-guy name.
You a tough guy?

456
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:17,523
Okay. Don't hurt yourself.

457
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:21,426
That's it, Cheese.
Keep them coming.

458
00:40:21,805 --> 00:40:22,863
Next.

459
00:40:24,274 --> 00:40:25,605
Okay. Next.

460
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:28,734
Iridessa,
how are those lanterns coming?

461
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:32,941
Almost done, Fairy Mary. Whoa!
Good shot, Cheese.

462
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,178
Next, I'll get Rosetta some light crystals
for the fireworks.

463
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:40,313
I can't wait to mix them up
with my begonias, gardenias and...

464
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,891
Forget-me-nots.
Forget-me-nots.

465
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:47,062
I keep forgetting those.

466
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:51,528
Fawn, show me how that
21 -butterfly salute is coming along.

467
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:55,160
All right, fellas, when I blow the whistle,
you guys go.

468
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:58,340
On your mark, get set...

469
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:04,844
One down and 20 to go.

470
00:41:05,682 --> 00:41:09,448
Keep at it, sweetie.
Silvermist, what are you working on?

471
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,713
Pollywog bubbles. Okay, guys.

472
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,388
Ooh!

473
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,929
There you go.
Nicely done, dear.

474
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,257
Next.

475
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:27,526
Fireworks. Is it ready yet?

476
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:28,968
Yes!
Let her rip!

477
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,835
Right, Bobble.
Dear.

478
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:36,206
I'm okay.

479
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,781
Still okay.

480
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,147
Honestly.

481
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,534
One, two.

482
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:04,698
I don't understand, Blaze.
We should've seen land by now.

483
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:10,176
You go ahead and get some rest.
I'll take first watch.

484
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,941
Whoa! I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm...
In a tree?

485
00:42:45,115 --> 00:42:47,276
This must be the lost island.

486
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:51,449
There it is.
The stone arch from the story!

487
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:54,412
You stay here and guard the balloon.

488
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:57,821
I'll be right back.

489
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:16,768
Oh!

490
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,345
Oh, no.

491
00:43:18,448 --> 00:43:22,646
This is supposed to be a rock arch,
not a twisty, branchy, tree arch.

492
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:39,061
Not now.

493
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:46,709
What has gotten into you?

494
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:51,071
Blaze, where's the balloon?

495
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:54,179
It's gone?

496
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:57,250
My compass, my supplies,
my pixie dust.

497
00:43:57,754 --> 00:44:00,655
I left you in charge.
Why didn't you warn me?

498
00:44:02,826 --> 00:44:04,418
Well, I... You...

499
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:09,359
Okay, okay. We'll get back to that later.
We gotta find that balloon.

500
00:44:27,116 --> 00:44:28,242
Blaze!

501
00:44:38,094 --> 00:44:39,152
Tink?

502
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:48,129
I'm so sorry...
Terence. Terence. How did you...

503
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:51,765
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

504
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:54,036
This is your fault!
Tink, I...

505
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,338
I was just trying to be a good friend. I...

506
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:58,175
Just leave me alone!

507
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,983
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

508
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:11,383
No. Terence, come back. Terence.

509
00:45:12,795 --> 00:45:13,989
Terence.

510
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,203
Blaze, where are you?

511
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,936
Blaze!

512
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:41,981
I lost my balloon. I lost my pixie dust.
I'm starving.

513
00:45:43,393 --> 00:45:44,985
What have I done?

514
00:46:51,527 --> 00:46:55,429
Wow, that hit the spot.
Thank you so much.

515
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:01,327
Hey, we're lost.

516
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:05,839
By any chance, have you seen
a stone arch around here?

517
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:30,195
I'm out of dust.
Looks like I'll be walking from here.

518
00:47:39,575 --> 00:47:40,906
My compass!

519
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:45,839
Ouch!

520
00:47:46,482 --> 00:47:48,347
That is a sharp thingy.

521
00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:50,312
Terence.

522
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:06,333
The stone arch. Blaze, hey, we made it!
We're here!

523
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,866
Thank you so much.

524
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:16,604
Thank you all so much. Bye, now. Bye!

525
00:48:18,748 --> 00:48:21,911
Great to have friends
that will help you out, huh?

526
00:48:28,591 --> 00:48:30,786
I know Tink is my best friend.

527
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:33,861
We should just forgive each other.

528
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:37,421
Someone just needs
to take the first step.

529
00:48:38,034 --> 00:48:39,058
Who?

530
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:42,329
Yeah, well, I think it should be Tink.

531
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:44,835
Who?
Tink.

532
00:48:45,374 --> 00:48:47,968
She blamed me
for breaking the scepter.

533
00:48:48,978 --> 00:48:51,469
Who?
Tink!

534
00:48:52,048 --> 00:48:53,538
I know she's under a lot of pressure,

535
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:56,447
but she shouldn't
have treated me that way.

536
00:48:56,986 --> 00:48:58,749
She should apologize.

537
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:00,446
Who?

538
00:49:06,262 --> 00:49:07,251
Me.

539
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:10,396
Thank you so much, Mr. Owl.

540
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,266
You know what? You are truly
the wisest of all the creatures.

541
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:21,904
The fellows are making fun
of my kilt again.

542
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:25,445
Who?
The guys at the depot!

543
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:27,876
They keep calling it a skirt.

544
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:38,116
Hey, Tink, it's me.

545
00:49:39,095 --> 00:49:43,862
Look, I know you're mad at me, okay,
but there's something I need to tell you.

546
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:46,426
Tink?

547
00:49:52,742 --> 00:49:54,107
Anyone home?

548
00:49:59,148 --> 00:50:00,615
The moonstone.

549
00:50:05,354 --> 00:50:06,412
What?

550
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:23,699
It's our last day, Blaze.
We gotta find that shipwreck soon.

551
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,287
None shall pass
the secret troll bridge.

552
00:50:44,594 --> 00:50:48,052
Troll bridge?
I thought it was toll bridge.

553
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:51,967
Look, fellas, I don't want any trouble.
We are guardians of the secret...

554
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:55,003
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
What?

555
00:50:55,104 --> 00:50:57,902
It's my turn to give
the ominous warning, blockhead.

556
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:59,269
Is not.
Is too.

557
00:50:59,408 --> 00:51:03,936
Is not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not!
Is too! Is too! Too! Too! Too! Too! Too!

558
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,809
You did it last time.

559
00:51:06,082 --> 00:51:08,880
That was over 300 years ago!

560
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,548
Go ahead.

561
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:16,916
We are guardians of the secret bridge.

562
00:51:17,226 --> 00:51:21,390
Beat it before we grind your bones
to make our bed.

563
00:51:23,132 --> 00:51:24,690
Bread.
What?

564
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:31,367
The expression is, Grind your bones
to make our bread, not bed.

565
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:33,334
Oh? Really?

566
00:51:34,977 --> 00:51:37,741
Who would want
to make bread out of bones?

567
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,511
Might break a tooth.

568
00:51:39,615 --> 00:51:42,413
Well, who would want to sleep in a bed
made of bones?

569
00:51:42,551 --> 00:51:45,679
It's hard on the back. It'll put a crick
in your neck, you knucklehead.

570
00:51:45,788 --> 00:51:49,019
Lx-nay in front of the ictim-vay.

571
00:51:49,692 --> 00:51:51,284
Gravel for brains.

572
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:52,793
Fuzz face.
Thimble head.

573
00:51:52,895 --> 00:51:54,226
Stinky breath.
Googly eyes.

574
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,763
Waxy ears!
Unibrow!

575
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:57,833
Excuse me. I need to get through.

576
00:51:57,933 --> 00:52:00,333
None shall pass!

577
00:52:00,603 --> 00:52:03,265
Do you have any idea
what I've been through to get here?

578
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:04,771
I almost got attacked by bugs and bats

579
00:52:04,874 --> 00:52:06,307
and got blown all over the place
by the wind,

580
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:09,037
and almost starved to death to find
a mirror that grants one last wish,

581
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:10,169
which I wouldn't have even needed

582
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:12,110
if Terence had taken his time
finding me a sharp thingy

583
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:13,909
instead of making me
break the moonstone.

584
00:52:14,016 --> 00:52:16,041
And then he didn't even share
his pixie dust because he cares more

585
00:52:16,152 --> 00:52:17,881
about the stupid rules
than he does about me...

586
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:20,148
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

587
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:22,952
Who's Terence?
Is he a friend of yours?

588
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:24,890
Well, yeah.

589
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:28,260
He was my best friend.

590
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:32,425
You're not very nice.
Hey, don't you judge me!

591
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:35,766
You've been yelling at each other
since I got here.

592
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:37,839
But he knows I don't mean it, don't you?

593
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,305
You old softie.

594
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:45,671
Like when I call you wart face.
Yes. Or when I call you big nose.

595
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:48,714
Booger breath.
Stinky feet.

596
00:52:48,818 --> 00:52:50,581
Weasel toes!
Badger brain!

597
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,816
Garden gnome!
Garden gnome?

598
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:59,823
Oh, dear,
I don't know where that came from.

599
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:04,895
I crossed the line.
Say the magic words. Go on.

600
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:09,727
I'm sorry.

601
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,330
Do you mean it?
Absolutely.

602
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:14,375
Do you feel it?
Deeply.

603
00:53:16,045 --> 00:53:18,946
Well, then, I forgive you.

604
00:53:21,384 --> 00:53:24,182
Friends?
Friends.

605
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:30,786
Come here, buddy.
Pal!

606
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:32,827
Amigo.
Compadre.

607
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:35,061
You're the best.
No, you.

608
00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:36,961
No, you.
No, you're right, I am the best.

609
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:39,762
So now you think you're the best?
I know I'm the best!

610
00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:41,598
Now, don't you argue with me!

611
00:53:41,704 --> 00:53:42,762
Well, you're ugly
and stinky.

612
00:53:42,872 --> 00:53:43,930
Really?

613
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,646
Blaze, listen, it's the ocean.

614
00:54:32,154 --> 00:54:36,853
The ship that sunk but never sank.
Okay, Blaze, this is it.

615
00:54:37,226 --> 00:54:40,491
We gotta find that mirror
and fix the moonstone. Let's go.

616
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:11,217
Why couldn't the mirror
be in a bunny-filled meadow?

617
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,726
Blaze!

618
00:56:33,237 --> 00:56:35,171
Who's that? Who's there?

619
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:05,299
Look, Blaze.

620
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:21,106
Ah!

621
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,459
What do you think? Too big?

622
00:57:39,636 --> 00:57:43,436
It's gotta be in here somewhere, Blaze.
Come on. Help me look.

623
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:10,696
It's real.

624
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:24,406
Okay. Deep breath.

625
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:29,541
Clear your mind.
Only get one shot at this. Here it goes.

626
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:33,679
I wish... I wish...

627
00:58:35,259 --> 00:58:36,590
I wish...

628
00:58:38,996 --> 00:58:41,863
Blaze, I wish you'd be quiet
for one minute!

629
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:50,435
No, no, no, no! No!
That one didn't count!

630
00:58:50,908 --> 00:58:53,843
I take it back.
Please, please. I take it back!

631
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:56,037
That wasn't my wish. Please!

632
00:58:57,948 --> 00:59:00,109
Blaze, look what you've done!

633
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:04,487
This mirror was my last chance.
This is all your fault!

634
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,232
I'm sorry, Blaze. It's not your fault.

635
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,308
It's mine.

636
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,716
It's all mine.

637
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:43,893
I wish Terence were here.

638
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:47,256
I wish we were still friends.

639
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:52,797
We are friends, Tink.

640
00:59:54,705 --> 00:59:55,899
Terence.

641
00:59:57,107 --> 01:00:00,736
I am so sorry.
I forgive you.

642
01:00:02,546 --> 01:00:04,241
I miss you so much.

643
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:08,874
I miss you, too. But, Tink, why...

644
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:12,684
Why didn't you tell me
about the moonstone?

645
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:15,584
I didn't want anyone to know.

646
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:18,690
I didn't think
I needed any help, Terence.

647
01:00:19,062 --> 01:00:21,860
I was wrong. I wish you were here.

648
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,700
I am here.
I know you are.

649
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:29,736
But, I mean, really here, with me.

650
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:32,808
I am with you.

651
01:00:33,043 --> 01:00:36,911
No. I mean here, Terence,
right next to me.

652
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:39,645
I'm standing behind you.

653
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:42,045
Terence!

654
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:47,856
I'm so sorry, Terence.
I know, I was so wrong...

655
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,926
Hey, hey. I'm sorry, too.

656
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,652
You know, you were under
a lot of pressure... Whoa! Hey.

657
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:56,592
Who's this?
This is Blaze.

658
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,600
He's been a big help
in some tough spots.

659
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:01,637
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
How did you...

660
01:01:01,738 --> 01:01:04,138
I flew all night and all day over the sea,

661
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:06,209
and just when I was gonna
run out of dust,

662
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,335
I stumbled
into that flying machine of yours.

663
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:09,673
That thing is awesome!

664
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,476
I only had a pinch of dust left.
It got me all the way here.

665
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:14,072
You found my balloon?

666
01:01:14,184 --> 01:01:16,744
But where did you even get the dust
to make it this far?

667
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:19,515
I, you know, borrowed a little extra.

668
01:01:20,023 --> 01:01:24,892
You broke the rules for me?
Hey, I knew you needed my help.

669
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:30,023
Run!

670
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:42,070
Blaze!

671
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:12,802
Hold on!

672
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:35,687
That was kind of fun.
What?

673
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:42,733
There's our way out.

674
01:02:49,045 --> 01:02:51,513
Terence, buy me some time.
Come on, Blaze.

675
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:03,693
Back, you dirty rats!

676
01:03:32,589 --> 01:03:34,750
Are they gone?
They're gone.

677
01:03:41,031 --> 01:03:42,259
Let's go.

678
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:45,497
Come here, you vicious monster.

679
01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:59,115
Now, how are we
gonna fly this thing?

680
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:01,241
I used the last of my dust
getting it here.

681
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:03,182
Well, with any luck,
my pixie-dust bag

682
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:05,049
should be around here somewhere.

683
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:07,522
Is it enough?

684
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:11,893
Yeah, it's enough. Anchors up.
Aye-aye, Captain.

685
01:04:13,897 --> 01:04:17,924
Just a little bit of pixie dust up front
will get this baby going.

686
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:21,504
That should do the trick.

687
01:04:21,805 --> 01:04:22,897
Whoa!

688
01:04:25,609 --> 01:04:26,633
Wow.

689
01:04:27,077 --> 01:04:29,671
I guess it pays
to have a dust-keeper fairy around.

690
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:32,441
I'm telling you, we just might make it.

691
01:04:34,084 --> 01:04:36,052
Hey, are you okay?

692
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,811
What's gonna happen
when we get back?

693
01:04:40,457 --> 01:04:43,324
Would you happen to have
an extra moonstone?

694
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:52,564
I don't know if it's gonna help,
but I brought this.

695
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:56,870
My scepter.

696
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,319
Hey, I've got an idea.

697
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:17,616
Terence?
Right. Right.

698
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:19,791
No, I know. You need your space.

699
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:23,354
No. I can't do this without you.
Would you help me?

700
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:24,825
Sure.

701
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:28,569
If I turn this, then this can go in here.

702
01:05:28,672 --> 01:05:30,469
Wait a second.
You think this would work?

703
01:05:30,574 --> 01:05:32,838
Yeah. Yeah!
Okay, okay.

704
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:34,205
Set it at a 30-degree angle

705
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:36,211
so that the reflective qualities
of the moonstone...

706
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:38,941
Are magnified in relation
to the moonbeam rays.

707
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:40,812
Yes! You're a genius.

708
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:46,581
I almost got it. I just need...
Like a sharp thingy?

709
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:48,649
Yeah.

710
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,952
Excuse me, Blaze.

711
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:25,057
That's a bit heavier than I remember.

712
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:33,129
1,492, 1,493...

713
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:34,260
No, no, no.

714
01:06:34,371 --> 01:06:37,431
It's all right.
Tink will be here any second now.

715
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,735
The blue harvest moon is high.

716
01:06:40,377 --> 01:06:42,971
The moonbeams
are almost at their mark.

717
01:06:43,413 --> 01:06:45,108
This is a disaster.

718
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:48,479
Fairy Mary, where is Tinker Bell?

719
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:50,047
I don't know!
You...

720
01:06:50,153 --> 01:06:51,814
Minister, Fairy Mary?

721
01:06:51,921 --> 01:06:53,616
Yes, Your Highness?

722
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:54,815
Is anything the matter?

723
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:56,915
Yes...
No, Your Highness.

724
01:06:57,193 --> 01:06:59,684
Where is Tinker Bell?
Well, we've been...

725
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:00,990
Whoa! Look up there!

726
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,198
Tinker Bell!

727
01:07:06,836 --> 01:07:08,303
Hi, everybody!

728
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:10,002
Wow!
Wow!

729
01:07:14,778 --> 01:07:18,236
Hi! Queen Clarion, Fairy Mary,
I made it!

730
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:22,106
There she is.
Now that's an entrance.

731
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:25,120
Right in the nick of time.

732
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:37,499
Your Highness.

733
01:07:38,635 --> 01:07:41,263
Tinker Bell,
at the beginning of the season,

734
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:44,397
you were entrusted
with a great responsibility.

735
01:07:45,408 --> 01:07:47,399
Where is the fall scepter?

736
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:50,470
There were complications,

737
01:07:51,848 --> 01:07:54,248
but it's ready now, Your Highness.

738
01:07:54,684 --> 01:07:56,174
This way, dear.

739
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,661
Fairies of Pixie Hollow,
I present the autumn scepter.

740
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:17,200
The moonstone! One, two...

741
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:23,906
No, no, no. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
Just... Just wait.

742
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:27,114
Wait, wait.

743
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:29,109
Come on, come on.

744
01:08:29,385 --> 01:08:31,979
Please work. Please work. Please work.

745
01:08:54,511 --> 01:08:58,880
Your Majesty, I've never seen
this much blue pixie dust before.

746
01:08:59,048 --> 01:09:00,208
Indeed.

747
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:05,250
It's at least a million smidges.
Maybe more.

748
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:09,514
It's more.
Yeah. Much more.

749
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,018
This is amazing!

750
01:09:14,531 --> 01:09:17,295
Only Tinker Bell.
Pretty good, huh?

751
01:09:18,234 --> 01:09:20,498
Come on, girls. It's show time.

752
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:24,364
Fairies
of Pixie Hollow,

753
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:28,570
we have celebrated this revelry
without interruption for centuries.

754
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,840
Tonight, I believe,
is our finest revelry ever,

755
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:37,614
thanks to one very special fairy,
Tinker Bell.

756
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:42,748
And her friend, Terence.

757
01:09:44,494 --> 01:09:46,792
And her new friend.
Blaze.

758
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:51,333
Yes, of course. Blaze.
We owe them all our thanks.

759
01:09:56,739 --> 01:10:00,072
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you, Fairy Mary.

760
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:02,902
What made you think
of breaking the moonstone

761
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:05,446
into all those tiny little pieces?

762
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:07,075
Genius!

763
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:11,583
On your lead, my dear.

764
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:17,389
All right, everyone.
To the pixie-dust tree!

765
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:26,891
That's our cue!

766
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:36,870
There are the bubbles. Hit it, Clank.

767
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:43,513
It worked, Bobble! It worked!

768
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:46,280
Aye, it certainly did.

769
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:55,491
To believe in who you are

770
01:10:55,899 --> 01:11:00,393
Who you were always meant to be

771
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:05,239
To you open up your heart

772
01:11:05,842 --> 01:11:10,006
Then you set your spirit free

773
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:15,040
In this time of the season

774
01:11:15,351 --> 01:11:19,583
Every leaf on every tree

775
01:11:20,123 --> 01:11:22,318
Start to shine

776
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,684
Come and see

777
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:27,089
Take my hand

778
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,127
Come with me

779
01:11:29,265 --> 01:11:34,669
And fly

780
01:11:39,676 --> 01:11:42,372
The greatest treasures
are not gold

781
01:11:42,478 --> 01:11:45,038
Nor jewels, nor works of art

782
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:50,282
They cannot be held in your hands
They're held within your heart

783
01:11:51,187 --> 01:11:56,386
For worldly things will fade away
as seasons come and go

784
01:11:57,093 --> 01:12:02,554
But the treasure of true friendship
will never lose its glow

785
01:12:26,356 --> 01:12:30,349
Sometimes you think
you'll be fine by yourself

786
01:12:30,727 --> 01:12:35,289
'Cause a dream
is a wish that you make all alone

787
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:39,930
It's easy to feel like you don't need help

788
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:44,071
But it's harder to walk on your own

789
01:12:44,707 --> 01:12:48,905
You'll change inside

790
01:12:49,379 --> 01:12:53,213
When you realize

791
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:55,647
The world comes to life

792
01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:58,414
And everything's all right

793
01:12:58,554 --> 01:13:01,216
From beginning to end

794
01:13:01,324 --> 01:13:04,953
When you have a friend
by your side

795
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:07,757
That helps you to find

796
01:13:08,564 --> 01:13:12,625
The beauty you are
when you open your heart

797
01:13:12,735 --> 01:13:15,829
And believe in

798
01:13:16,873 --> 01:13:19,899
The gift of a friend

799
01:13:21,611 --> 01:13:25,274
The gift of a friend

800
01:13:27,683 --> 01:13:31,983
Someone who knows
when your lost and you're scared

801
01:13:32,388 --> 01:13:36,324
There through
the highs and the lows

802
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:41,326
Someone to count on
Someone who cares

803
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:45,333
Beside you wherever you'll go

804
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:50,201
You'll change inside

805
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:54,437
When you realize

806
01:13:54,577 --> 01:13:56,875
The world comes to life

807
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:59,447
And everything's all right

808
01:13:59,916 --> 01:14:02,316
From beginning to end

809
01:14:02,418 --> 01:14:06,149
When you have a friend
by your side

810
01:14:06,322 --> 01:14:09,155
That helps you to find

811
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:13,956
The beauty you are
when you open your heart

812
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:17,396
And believe in

813
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:22,934
The gift of a friend

814
01:14:24,207 --> 01:14:28,837
And when your hope crashes down
Shattering to the ground

815
01:14:28,945 --> 01:14:32,210
You'll feel all alone

816
01:14:32,748 --> 01:14:35,842
When you don't know which way to go

817
01:14:35,952 --> 01:14:39,649
And there's no signs leading you on

818
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:44,985
You're not alone

819
01:14:46,429 --> 01:14:48,556
The world comes to life

820
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:51,428
And everything's all right

821
01:14:51,534 --> 01:14:54,196
From beginning to end

822
01:14:54,303 --> 01:14:56,294
When you have a friend

823
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:58,066
By your side

824
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:01,200
That helps you to find

825
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:05,709
The beauty you are
when you open your heart

826
01:15:05,815 --> 01:15:09,148
You believe in

827
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:14,481
When you believe in

828
01:15:14,824 --> 01:15:18,692
When you believe in

829
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:23,462
The gift of a friend

830
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:56,796
Where the sunbeams play
in the highland glade

831
01:15:57,166 --> 01:16:01,398
Where the leaves are gently falling

832
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:08,244
Where we used to dance
in the autumn shade

833
01:16:08,778 --> 01:16:13,806
My foolish pride drove you away

834
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:19,990
Where the storm clouds rose
and the cold winds blew

835
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:24,525
Oh, I could not hear you calling

836
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:31,290
Till you took my hand
and you pulled me through

837
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:36,270
To where the sunbeams play

838
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:42,170
To ride with you
upon the wind

839
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:47,450
To fly above the sea

840
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:53,145
To be far and wide
of Neverland

841
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,450
I would dare to go

842
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,460
If you would go with me

843
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:06,065
Now the wind blows our love
against our day

844
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:11,265
And the dark of night is falling

845
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:15,000
But if you're with me

846
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,980
We will find our way

847
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:25,330
To where the sunbeams
To where the sunbeams

848
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:30,155
To where the sunbeams dance

849
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:36,400
And play

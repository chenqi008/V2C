1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,380
Have you ever wondered
how nature gets its glow?

2
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,366
Who gives it light and color
as the seasons come and go?

3
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,830
Who helps all creatures,
great and small,

4
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,525
to walk, to swim, to fly?

5
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,400
Who crafts such tiny details?

6
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:21,000
You might see them if you try.

7
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,310
For it's all the work of fairies,
but they stay well out of sight.

8
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,490
And the first time that a baby laughs,
a fairy's life takes flight.

9
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,288
When the moon comes out

10
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,526
To shine her face

11
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:48,399
The birds are fast asleep

12
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:54,876
And the lanterns hang from every post
The fairies leave their keep

13
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:58,675
They join their hands
and sing their songs

14
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:01,683
That nary a soul can hear

15
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,686
In the springtime
when the earth is new

16
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:09,450
To the fairies they draw near

17
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:16,522
To the fairies they draw near

18
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:44,975
- Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:46,576
- Hello.
- Hi.

20
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:48,314
- Hello.
- Hello.

21
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:50,183
Hello?

22
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,849
Queen Clarion.

23
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:07,265
Born of laughter, clothed in cheer,

24
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,173
happiness has brought you here.

25
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,147
Welcome to Pixie Hollow.
I trust you found your way all right.

26
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:17,310
I think so.

27
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:21,584
Now, let's see about those wings.

28
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,960
What are these things?

29
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,830
They will help you
find your talent, little one.

30
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,426
But how will I know which one is...

31
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:15,405
You'll know.

32
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:09,617
Hmm.

33
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:54,071
Whoa!

34
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:58,370
Never seen one glow that much before,
even for Vidia.

35
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:00,270
You know,
I do believe you're right.

36
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:04,211
Little daisy top
might be a very rare talent indeed.

37
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:15,156
Come forward, tinker fairies,

38
00:07:15,258 --> 00:07:20,252
and welcome the newest member
of your talent guild, Tinker Bell.

39
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:24,127
Glad we had a bath today, eh, Clank?

40
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:25,633
- Excuse us!
- Coming through!

41
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:28,203
Sorry! Make way for tinkers!

42
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:33,172
Hady-hi, hady-ho, Miss Bell. I'm Clank.

43
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,574
Splinters, Clank. Say it, don't spray it.

44
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,172
Phineas T. Kettletree, Esquire,
at your service.

45
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:41,527
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

46
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:44,714
Oh, foo! He's Bobble, I'm Clank.

47
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:47,389
Clank, Bobble.

48
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:51,755
We're pleased as a pile of
perfectly polished pots you're here.

49
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:52,920
Uh...

50
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:54,163
Me, too.

51
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:58,392
Come on, Miss Bell.
There's so much to show you.

52
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:05,670
You've arrived
at a most wondrous and glorious time.

53
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,036
Really? Why?

54
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:10,442
Why, it's almost time
for the changing of the seasons.

55
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:14,846
You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are
different realms for every time of year.

56
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,030
Well, there's one up ahead.

57
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,321
Winter Woods. It's always cold here.

58
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:28,021
Look there! Snowflake and frost fairies
returning home for...

59
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,792
For some well-deserved rest.

60
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,427
Aye. They've just finished
bringing winter to the world.

61
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:38,500
It's the off-season
for the autumn fairies, too.

62
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:41,906
Always practicing
that perfect shade of amber, eh?

63
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,808
And the fairies of Summer Glade

64
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,904
still have plenty of time to get ready.

65
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:48,210
But not as much
as the autumn fairies,

66
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:49,750
of course, because, well...

67
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:53,344
Yes, Clanky. Because
right now, fairies of every talent

68
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:56,753
are preparing for my favorite season,
springtime!

69
00:08:58,293 --> 00:08:59,293
Oh!

70
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:05,355
Get along.
Get along, little sproutlings, and dig.

71
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:11,770
Hello, there!

72
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:16,473
Come on, Miss Bell.
You've got to see where we live.

73
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,011
Welcome to Tinker's Nook.

74
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,246
Oh, wow!

75
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:37,798
Oh.

76
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,962
Come on.
There's so much to show you.

77
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:06,184
Cute.

78
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:09,526
Just taking some supplies down...

79
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,360
They're taking supplies
down to the workshop.

80
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:16,533
Let her go.

81
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,170
Watch out for falling...

82
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,706
Watch out for falling maple seeds!

83
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,235
Wow!

84
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:39,117
And over here is where most of us live.
There's your house...

85
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,524
There's your house, Tinker Bell.

86
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,696
- It's mine?
- Sure is.

87
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:51,529
We were hoping the new arrival
would be one of us,

88
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:54,037
so we got the place all ready.

89
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,539
We rounded up some work clothes...

90
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:58,041
- We didn't know your size.
- Yes, our apologies, but...

91
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:00,772
- But they might be too big.
- Yeah, well, that's only...

92
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,041
'Cause you're so tiny.

93
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:04,616
That'll do, Clank.

94
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:07,083
Please come on down to the workshop
when you're ready.

95
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:08,949
Fairy Mary will want to meet you.

96
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:10,283
Goodbye.

97
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:19,297
Oh.

98
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:06,003
Stop! What?

99
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:10,479
A five-gauge twig for an axle?
Clank, I told you it took a seven.

100
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:11,776
Oh, you said five.

101
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:16,013
I said seven! Oh, Clank, I tell you,
sometimes you can be pretty,

102
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:17,383
pretty...

103
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:22,687
So pretty.

104
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:27,963
- Who's that, then?
- It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain.

105
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:33,466
Wow, everyone seems so busy.

106
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:36,062
Well, spring won't spring itself.

107
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:40,611
Indeed, my bellowing buddy.
And we tinkers are a big part of it.

108
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:43,112
Allow us to elucidate, Miss Bell.

109
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:46,916
- We fiddle and fix.
- We craft and create.

110
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,986
- We carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

111
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:52,885
- Weave saddles and satchels.
- For birdies, you see.

112
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,982
- Make baskets and bushels.
- To carry the seeds!

113
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,789
- When preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more!

114
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:03,060
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

115
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:05,727
That was great.

116
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:10,637
So you see, Miss Bell, we help fairies
of every talent with our creations.

117
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:14,472
Unfortunately, all those fairies
are out of luck this year.

118
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:17,206
Unless we can actually
deliver these things to them.

119
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,748
The wagon repairs are finished, I trust?

120
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,980
Yes, Fairy Mary.

121
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:28,224
- Tip-top shape.
- No wheels missing whatsoever!

122
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,127
Then let's see it.

123
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,662
- Ah, you see... Well...
- See,

124
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,995
- with your eyes?
- Define "see," actually...

125
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,965
- You have to meet Tinker Bell!
- What? Who?

126
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:42,967
- She's new, Fairy Mary.
- Nice to meet you.

127
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,939
Rapture! A new charge on whom
we can lavish

128
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,772
all our tinkering wisdom and expertise!

129
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,813
Let me see those hands.

130
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:56,618
Teetering teapots, so dainty.

131
00:13:56,953 --> 00:14:01,014
Don't worry, dear. We'll build up those
tinker muscles in no time.

132
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,248
Okay.

133
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,986
- Now, boys, the deliveries?
- Aye, we're on it.

134
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,962
As a matter of fact,
we're heading out right this second.

135
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:12,933
- But we've only got one wheel.
- What was that?

136
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:17,403
Nothing really,
Clank was just asking...

137
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,873
If I can go as well!

138
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:22,971
- Yeah! Good one. Very nice.
- Yes! I wondered that,

139
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,539
- if you could go with us. Yes.
- That's exactly what he was saying.

140
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,914
Very well. Get on with it, then.

141
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,751
Slow down, Cheese, I can't keep up!

142
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,949
The mouse's name is Cheese?

143
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,892
Must be.
He always comes when we yell it.

144
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,216
Sprinting thistles!
Bobble! Bobble!

145
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:53,461
Easy. Easy, boy. It's all right.
Fawn's got you.

146
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:59,171
Easy. Easy, girl. It's all right.
Silvermist's got you.

147
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:01,807
Oh, you all right, sugar cane?

148
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,309
Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!

149
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:07,209
Elevate her legs. No, wait.
I mean her head.

150
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,225
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
If she's red, raise the head.

151
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,410
If she's pale, raise the tail.

152
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:13,585
Does she look pale or red?

153
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,484
She looks squished.

154
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:17,383
Sorry.

155
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,753
Here, let me, raindrop.
So, what happened to you, anyway?

156
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,193
- Well, I...
- It was sprinting thistles!

157
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:26,559
Those weeds are an absolute menace.

158
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:30,103
Always trampling things,
poking people in the petunia.

159
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,095
Gather round, ladies.

160
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:34,605
We've brought some selections

161
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:37,870
from the new spring line
of tinker specialties!

162
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,569
- All right!
- Show us, show us!

163
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,705
- What'd you bring?
- Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa.

164
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:45,477
Finally! Silvermist,
could you help me?

165
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,086
Oh.

166
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,764
What're you gonna do with that?

167
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,808
I'm gonna take it to the mainland.

168
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,103
What's the mainland?

169
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,235
It's where we're gonna go
change winter to spring.

170
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:15,974
The seasons change all the time there.

171
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:18,674
I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.

172
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:21,845
Yeah. And I'll have breakfast ready
for all the wittle fuzzies

173
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:23,945
coming out of hibernation.

174
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,857
We just follow the second star...

175
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,519
Ride the breeze, follow the waves...

176
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:32,597
All the way across the sea...

177
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:34,563
And then, there it is.

178
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:39,431
Wow! The mainland sounds flitterific!

179
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:46,441
Yes. The glamorous lives
of the nature-talent fairies, eh?

180
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,012
We'd love to stay and chat, but...

181
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:51,776
But we tinkers
have real work to do. Right?

182
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:55,114
- Don't get your wings in a bunch.
- Don't be like that.

183
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,653
Nice to meet you all!

184
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:59,986
- You, too! Fly with you later!
- Fly with you later!

185
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:03,693
Right! Here we are.

186
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:05,956
A pretty large order of pollen pots
for the...

187
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:22,806
Last thing is berry bushels
to deliver to the glen...

188
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:25,144
Is it okay
if I just catch up with you later?

189
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,739
Oh, I suppose.

190
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:29,577
Can you find your way back?

191
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,821
- Yeah, yeah. Sure I can.
- Well, I...

192
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:35,583
- All right, then.
- Just be careful!

193
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:40,063
Hi, there!

194
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,094
Sorry.

195
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:45,969
Vidia, right?

196
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,743
We didn't officially meet.
I'm Tinker Bell.

197
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:57,809
Oh, yes.

198
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:00,377
The new girl.

199
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:04,113
That's right! So, what's your talent?

200
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,990
What do you think it is?

201
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:14,087
You're a pollen-izer? Pollen-ator?
Pollen-picker? Pollen-plucker?

202
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:17,827
I am a fast-flying fairy,
a true rare talent.

203
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:20,770
And this is but a small part of what I do.

204
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:24,533
I make breezes in the summer,
blow down leaves in the fall.

205
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:27,439
My winds even brought you here, dear.

206
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:30,411
Fairies of every talent depend on me.

207
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,713
Hey, that's just like what I do.

208
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:36,118
Excuse me?

209
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:38,550
I mean, tinkers help fairies
of every talent, too.

210
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,180
So we're kind of the same, you know?

211
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,189
Sweetie, I make forces of nature.

212
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:49,392
You make pots and kettles.

213
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:53,765
I work up in the sky,
and you work down in a ditch.

214
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:55,495
Hey!

215
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:58,733
Don't get me wrong, sunshine.
Being a tinker is really swell and all,

216
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:02,005
but I wouldn't go around
bragging about your talent.

217
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:04,409
It's not like spring depends on you.

218
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:06,038
Of course it does!

219
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:09,744
And when I go to the mainland,
I'll prove just how important we are.

220
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:11,821
When who goes to the mainland?

221
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,754
Me, of course! For spring!

222
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,822
Oh, of course. You'll prove it, huh?

223
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:21,186
Yes, I will.

224
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:25,995
Well, I, for one,
am looking forward to that. Excuse me.

225
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,299
No. Excuse me.

226
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:36,868
"Mine is a rare talent."

227
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,136
Ugh.

228
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:42,180
Try and tell me tinkers don't matter.

229
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,775
I'll show her what a rare talent really is,
when I...

230
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,714
Oh.

231
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:21,770
- Hey, Tink, what you got there?
- Oh, hi.

232
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,846
I don't know. I just found them.

233
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:27,719
Lost things.

234
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,383
- Lost things.
- Aye.

235
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,449
Stuff gets lost and washes up
on Neverland from time to time.

236
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,290
You know, from the mainland.

237
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,523
These come from the mainland?

238
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:41,293
That place sounds
more fascinating all the time.

239
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:45,929
Berry bushels, check.
Pollen pots, check. Lost things, check.

240
00:22:46,673 --> 00:22:47,673
Huh?

241
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:51,606
Lost things?
Why are you fiddling with that junk?

242
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:53,042
Oh, um...

243
00:22:53,446 --> 00:22:56,074
Well, they were just so unusual.

244
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:58,650
You mustn't be wasting your time
with that rubbish.

245
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,312
And I won't have it
cluttering up my workshop.

246
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,252
And as for you two,

247
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:06,423
no more dilly-dallying around.

248
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:08,926
And don't forget about
the Queen's review tonight.

249
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:11,895
Goodness, there's still
so much to be done!

250
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:16,966
Thank you.

251
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:19,729
Sorry about your trinkets, Miss Bell.

252
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:22,830
Well, we'd best be getting ready
for the review, anyway.

253
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:25,102
What is the Queen's review?

254
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,146
You see, the Queen is going to
review all the preparations for spring!

255
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:33,241
Yeah, it's a good time for us tinkers
to show what we can do, eh?

256
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:35,115
- Oh, indeed.
- Really?

257
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:37,745
Like me. I can be a wheel.

258
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,548
Hmm.

259
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:43,356
Perfect. That's my chance.

260
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:44,979
Okay, everybody, turn!
Ready for the base coat over here!

261
00:24:55,633 --> 00:25:00,536
Splendid, splendid. Stack those neatly,
plenty of time before the Queen arrives.

262
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:01,832
It's the Queen!

263
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:05,033
What? She's here? Now?
Play, music fairies.

264
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,406
Yes, play!

265
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:24,656
Queen Clarion, Your Illustriousness!

266
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:28,993
As Minister of Spring,
I welcome you to Springtime Square.

267
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:31,599
What? No fireworks, Minister?

268
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:34,727
Oh, well, yeah, that could be arranged.
Light fairies! Light fairies!

269
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:38,035
I'm teasing.
You always make such a fuss,

270
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:41,008
and everything always
turns out wonderfully.

271
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:46,710
Well, I think you'll find
that we have things well in hand.

272
00:25:46,816 --> 00:25:48,374
When the Everblossom blooms,

273
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:51,010
we'll be ready to bring
spring to the mainland!

274
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:53,351
Music to my ears.

275
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:56,687
I know you've all put in months
of practice and preparation,

276
00:25:57,227 --> 00:25:59,991
but keep up the good work
these last few days,

277
00:26:00,096 --> 00:26:02,121
- because just as fairies...
- Queen Clarion!

278
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:04,999
Huh?

279
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:06,834
Queen Clarion!

280
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,568
- Did I miss anything?
- No, no, no.

281
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:12,229
Phew! Good.

282
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:13,808
It's all right.

283
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:15,706
I came up with some fantastic things

284
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:18,371
for tinkers to use
when we go to the mainland.

285
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:22,116
What's she talking about?

286
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:23,810
Let me show you!

287
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,752
First, baby chipmunks
can't eat the whole nut, right?

288
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:31,189
Their little teeth can't chew big bites.

289
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:34,751
So you just crank back this lever,
and it's...

290
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,500
Whoops.

291
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:49,539
- It's kind of a work in progress.
- Yes, yes, yes. Very clever.

292
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:52,814
Oh!

293
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:55,509
And I made this, too.
It's a flower-sprayer.

294
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:58,815
- Tinker Bell, I...
- Here, allow me to demonstrate.

295
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,790
Sorry.

296
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:14,166
- But wait till you see this last one.
- Tinker Bell, sweetheart,

297
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:16,432
has no one explained?

298
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:19,696
Explained what?

299
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:23,008
Tinker fairies
don't go to the mainland, dear.

300
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:24,278
What?

301
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:27,940
All of those things
are done by the nature-talent fairies.

302
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,643
Your work is here in Pixie Hollow.

303
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:34,382
- But I thought that...
- I'm sorry, Tinker Bell.

304
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:40,591
Oh, okay. No. No, that's good.

305
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:43,391
I mean,
I really couldn't make it anyway.

306
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:48,367
So, good. Yeah.
This actually works out good.

307
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,603
I mean, well...
So, I'm just gonna... Yeah.

308
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,491
Back so soon?

309
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:14,387
You didn't go?

310
00:28:14,494 --> 00:28:18,089
Goodness, no.
Far too much work to do down here.

311
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:31,306
Vidia was right. Being a tinker stinks.

312
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,976
Excuse me?

313
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,945
It's just, why don't we get to go
to the mainland?

314
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:43,386
The mainland? Who gives
a pile of pebbles about the mainland?

315
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:46,616
But, Fairy Mary,
the other fairies get to go.

316
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:49,924
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you a garden fairy?

317
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:52,025
Well, no.

318
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:54,565
- Are you a light fairy?
- No.

319
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,431
Animal fairy? Water fairy, perhaps?

320
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,003
No and no.

321
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:03,303
No. You're not. You are a tinker.
It's who you are.

322
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,233
Be proud of it.

323
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,581
The day you can
magically make the flowers grow,

324
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:13,482
or capture the rays of the sun
and whatnot, then you can go.

325
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:16,083
Until then, your work is here.

326
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,141
Good idea, Fairy Mary.

327
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,459
Get your pixie dust yet?

328
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,527
Just did.

329
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,459
- Nice day for flying.
- Sure is.

330
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,563
Here you go, Silvermist.

331
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,393
Thank you, Terence.

332
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,001
I hope Tinker Bell is okay.

333
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,469
I know. That poor little sapling.

334
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,365
She looked pretty wilted yesterday.

335
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,841
Well, I wouldn't blame her
if she stayed in bed all day.

336
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,468
Morning, girls!

337
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,623
- Tinker Bell?
- Tinker Bell?

338
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,549
Guess what? I've decided I'm not
gonna be a tinker fairy anymore.

339
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,651
- What?
- What?

340
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,915
Well, I was thinking.
Why do I have to be a tinker?

341
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,582
Just 'cause
some silly hammer glowed?

342
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,353
I mean, who's to say
it wasn't some big mistake?

343
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,759
Maybe I can just switch my talent.

344
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:35,264
Switch your talent?
I don't know, Tinker Bell...

345
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,028
If you could teach me your talents,
any of them,

346
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,003
maybe I could show the Queen
I can work with nature, too.

347
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,008
And then she'd let me go
to the mainland for spring.

348
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,305
Oh, Tinker Bell.
That's just not how it works.

349
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:51,210
- Well, maybe she could.
- She's right. She could.

350
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:54,045
Well, I've never heard of someone
switching talents before.

351
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:56,085
She's right. Me, neither.

352
00:30:56,253 --> 00:31:02,749
Look. You all do things that are
beautiful and magical and important.

353
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,496
But me, well,

354
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:10,328
there's gotta be more to my life
than just pots and kettles.

355
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:14,068
All I'm asking
is that you give me a chance.

356
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,306
I'll help you, Tinker Bell.

357
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:19,068
Thank you, Sil.

358
00:31:19,176 --> 00:31:21,041
Me, too. Could be fun.

359
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:25,214
Well, first time for everything, I guess.
What harm can come from trying?

360
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:27,977
Well, I still think this is a bad idea.

361
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:33,181
So, for your first day
of water fairy training,

362
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,485
I could show you
how to make ripples in the pond.

363
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:36,650
Okay!

364
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,558
Or teach you how to talk
to the babbling brook.

365
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,392
Oh, that sounds fun, too.

366
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:44,728
Or wait, wait, wait.
I got it, I got it, I got it!

367
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:48,030
Dewdrops on spider webs!

368
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:50,868
Come on. I'll show you how to do it.

369
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:53,339
- Good luck, Tink!
- You can do it!

370
00:31:54,944 --> 00:31:56,002
Oh, um...

371
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:57,602
Go get 'em.

372
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:05,952
Just cup your hands like this,
reach into the water, and...

373
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,851
Okay, you've heard of a dewdrop?

374
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:12,894
This is a don't drop.
That's water fairy humor.

375
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:15,328
It's good.

376
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:16,932
Come on.

377
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:19,832
Okay, Tink, now,
this next part can be a little tricky.

378
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:22,700
It takes a very steady,
delicate hand to...

379
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:27,439
Where's your dewdrop?

380
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,710
Oh.

381
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,908
Forgot my dewdrop.

382
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:37,148
Hey! I did

383
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:39,087
it.

384
00:32:39,188 --> 00:32:42,588
Shake that one off. Shake it off.
You can do this!

385
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:49,127
That's it. That's it, Tink.
You're doing it! You're...

386
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:52,528
Now, Tink, try to...

387
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:56,065
No, no, sweetie, you need to...
Well, maybe if you...

388
00:32:57,272 --> 00:33:00,002
Well, you have to admire
her persistence.

389
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:01,299
Tinker Bell!

390
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:03,707
Although, sometimes hammers glow

391
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:05,812
for a reason.

392
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,712
Whoa.

393
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,737
You know, you always struck me
as a light fairy kind of gal.

394
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:44,309
Here we go in the treasure...

395
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,288
- Have you seen Tink?
- No, thank you. Not thirsty!

396
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,527
No, no. Not "drink," Tink!

397
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:57,524
Pink? I like purple meself!

398
00:33:57,631 --> 00:34:00,361
Tink! Have you seen Tink?

399
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:01,593
What?

400
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:05,229
I do not stink! Maybe it's you, eh?

401
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:09,309
Hey, have you seen Tink?

402
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:15,137
- Fairy Mary's gonna be cross.
- Aye, Clank.

403
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:17,530
We'd better take some of this
off Miss Bell's plate, so...

404
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:20,043
- All right, then.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, Clank!

405
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:28,819
What are...
Will you two stop mucking about?

406
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,194
- What Clank did was, he took it off...
- Bobble told me that I should...

407
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:36,257
I see Tinker Bell has
got her work done, mysteriously.

408
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,268
Where is she, anyway?

409
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:42,032
Well, you see, she's...

410
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:44,433
She went with Cheese to...

411
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:48,937
No, no. Clank means
she went to get cheese, you see,

412
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:52,040
- the food, for Cheese the mouse...
- Yes, the food, for Cheese the mouse.

413
00:34:52,151 --> 00:34:54,779
...because he was whining.

414
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:55,887
Yeah. Like a baby.

415
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:58,684
Like a wittle, wee baby, there.

416
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:15,639
Okay, what can I teach you that's
gonna do the least amount of damage?

417
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:20,702
Oh, I know. Follow me, Tinker Bell.

418
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:30,383
The last light of day,
it's the richest kind of all!

419
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,357
Wait for it. Wait for it.

420
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:36,324
Okay, and now!

421
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,293
Oh, wow.

422
00:35:40,665 --> 00:35:41,757
Huh?

423
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:45,133
It's incredible.

424
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:47,068
Now for the fun part.

425
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:51,739
- Do you think it's heavy?
- No. It's light.

426
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:04,820
Okay, okay.

427
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,212
Stay.

428
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:41,348
- Here, Tink. Let me...
- No! I almost got it.

429
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,153
If I just get you started...

430
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,194
This is impossible!

431
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,861
Look out!

432
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:57,335
Oh, no.

433
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,771
Whoa!

434
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:05,015
I wonder how it's going.

435
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:07,748
Fly, Tink, fly!

436
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:09,579
Uh-oh.

437
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,079
We'll save you, Tink!

438
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,157
Bob and weave!
Bob and weave!

439
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:16,488
Cover your tushy!

440
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,804
- We fiddle and fix.
- Craft and create.

441
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:34,035
- Carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

442
00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:36,703
- Preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more.

443
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:40,579
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

444
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:45,249
Tinker Bell,
I'd like a word with you.

445
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:46,720
Fairy Mary!

446
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:52,089
See, I was on my deliveries,
and it's actually kind of...

447
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:55,460
Save it.
I know what you've been up to, missy.

448
00:37:57,267 --> 00:38:00,168
And I had such high hopes for you.

449
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:13,505
- You'd do well to listen to her...
- Why?

450
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:15,550
So I can do this my whole life?

451
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:18,678
I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!

452
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:24,024
No, no, not that you guys are...

453
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:29,191
I didn't mean that... Guys, I wasn't...

454
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:32,933
I have to go.

455
00:38:47,382 --> 00:38:52,251
Now, flap them. Flap them.
That's it! Have fun!

456
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,990
Hey, Tink! You ready?

457
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:01,089
A little nervous, actually.

458
00:39:01,196 --> 00:39:03,858
Oh, don't be silly.
Come on, you'll be fine.

459
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,696
We're teaching baby birds
how to fly.

460
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:10,064
First, you have to get their attention.

461
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:13,039
Smile and establish trust.

462
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:19,478
See? Okay, open your wings, honey,
and flap them up and down.

463
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:23,841
Up and down. That's the way.
Faster, faster.

464
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:27,853
That's right. Yes! You're doing it! Okay.
Come out this way a little bit.

465
00:39:28,856 --> 00:39:33,816
You're okay. You're okay. You got it.
Keep flapping, keep flapping!

466
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:36,896
Hey, why don't you help
that last little guy?

467
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:46,397
Okay, okay.
Just smile and establish trust.

468
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,172
Hi, there!

469
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:53,002
Hey, little fella,
you wanna do some flap-flap today?

470
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:56,573
Oh, sure you do!

471
00:39:56,684 --> 00:40:00,552
All you do is,
you just flap your wings, like this.

472
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:06,489
No, no, no. None of that.
Come on. All we got to do is...

473
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:07,594
Ow!

474
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,296
Look. I'm going to level with you, okay?

475
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,029
I kind of bombed out on
the whole water and light fairy things,

476
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:18,502
and I'm starting to
run out of options here.

477
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:21,130
If you could see fit
to flap your little wings

478
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:23,607
and take flight
for a few measly seconds,

479
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,111
I might be able to go to the mainland
and bring happiness to the world!

480
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:29,147
What do you say?

481
00:40:30,016 --> 00:40:31,483
Wrong answer.

482
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:35,686
If I end up making acorn kettles
for the rest of my life,

483
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:37,780
I am holding you
personally responsible.

484
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:41,426
Hey, hey. Look at this!

485
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:46,622
Okay, just stop squirming.
Would you just... Hey!

486
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:50,928
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm letting go. I am letting go.

487
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,471
This is not working.

488
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,638
Hey, maybe that guy can help.
He's a really good flyer.

489
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:06,618
Hey, up there!

490
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:11,248
Hawk!

491
00:41:22,134 --> 00:41:23,499
- What's happening?
- Quick, hide!

492
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:24,864
Look out!

493
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:33,009
A hawk! Tinker Bell's in trouble!

494
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:48,488
- Hey!
- Vidia?

495
00:41:48,594 --> 00:41:50,494
This is my hiding spot!

496
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:54,498
But it's all yours, now.

497
00:41:57,236 --> 00:41:58,260
No!

498
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:12,343
- Get him!
- Get him!

499
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:20,348
- What?
- You all right?

500
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:23,153
So scary.

501
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:32,498
Are you okay, Vidia?

502
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:38,034
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me! I'm fine!

503
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:41,407
- But I was only trying to help.
- Well, stop trying.

504
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,740
Tinker Bell...

505
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:51,847
I can't hold water. I can't hold light.

506
00:42:51,956 --> 00:42:55,687
Birds hate me. I'm just so useless!

507
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:56,987
Tink.

508
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,841
Great.
I failed for the third time in a row.

509
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:18,610
At this rate, I should get to
the mainland right about... Oh... Never!

510
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:21,817
Huh?

511
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:16,629
Yes!

512
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:26,739
Sil!

513
00:45:11,893 --> 00:45:13,190
Beautiful.

514
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:43,390
- You fixed it!
- Wow!

515
00:45:43,558 --> 00:45:45,389
- Beautiful!
- Amazing!

516
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,570
What are you guys doing here?

517
00:45:46,594 --> 00:45:49,461
It might be
the sparkliest thing I've ever seen,

518
00:45:49,564 --> 00:45:51,088
and I've seen a lot of sparkly things!

519
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,533
It's a really pretty thingy. What is it?

520
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,565
I don't know. I just found it.

521
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:02,074
Tinker Bell, don't you even realize
what you're doing? You're tinkering!

522
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:05,812
What? No, no, this isn't... I was just...

523
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:10,277
Creating those gadgets,
figuring things out, fixing stuff like this,

524
00:46:10,584 --> 00:46:12,347
that's what tinkering is, sweetie!

525
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:15,910
Don't you like doing this?
Isn't it what you really love?

526
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:18,547
Yeah! Who cares about
going to the mainland, anyway?

527
00:46:18,658 --> 00:46:20,990
Well, I do, remember?

528
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:23,891
I want to see
where these things come from.

529
00:46:23,997 --> 00:46:26,329
Why are you saying this?
Are you just giving up on me?

530
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:29,925
I mean, aren't you going to teach me
to be a garden fairy anymore?

531
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:32,732
Sweet pea, I think this is your talent.

532
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,570
Tink, we just want you to be happy.

533
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:38,610
If you really want me to be happy,
you'll help me get to the mainland

534
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,373
like you promised.

535
00:46:41,681 --> 00:46:44,878
Please, Tinker Bell, just think about it.

536
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:26,383
Will you teach me how to be
a fast-flying fairy?

537
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:30,989
Please? I know I could do it!

538
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,861
With your help, I could be flying
as fast as you in no time.

539
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,264
Vidia, you're my last hope.
All my friends have given up on me.

540
00:47:40,773 --> 00:47:44,504
Rosetta won't even try to teach me
to be a garden fairy now.

541
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:49,711
I bet I could at least paint some flowers
or plant some sproutlings.

542
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:53,082
I mean,
there must be something I could do.

543
00:47:55,854 --> 00:47:59,346
Or if you really want to be
a garden fairy...

544
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,499
Capture the sprinting thistles.

545
00:48:13,605 --> 00:48:17,735
Well, okay. I can do this. Yeah!

546
00:48:19,911 --> 00:48:21,674
Okay. Ready, Cheese?

547
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:26,576
Come on. They're just weeds.

548
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,717
Besides, there were only
seven or eight at the most, right?

549
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:38,621
Hyah!

550
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:47,838
We can do this. I know we can do this.
What do you say?

551
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:53,003
Attaboy.

552
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,352
This ought to be good.

553
00:49:17,734 --> 00:49:18,826
Hey!

554
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:21,496
Come on, you!
Oh, come on!

555
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:26,701
Just a bit this way!
It's working! It's working!

556
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:36,013
Come on!

557
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:46,462
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back! Come back!

558
00:49:48,764 --> 00:49:54,634
These things just won't listen!
Come on, Cheese. Go, go, go!

559
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:02,876
Okay, definitely more than eight.

560
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:07,910
Please file into the corral
in an orderly manner!

561
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:11,978
Wait!

562
00:50:14,724 --> 00:50:16,589
Oh, no! Come on!

563
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:24,199
Come on, now.

564
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:36,607
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. So sorry.

565
00:50:36,779 --> 00:50:38,679
This is the last batch.

566
00:50:42,852 --> 00:50:44,114
Look out!

567
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,146
Sorry. Sorry!

568
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:41,135
Oh, no.

569
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:42,935
Tink. What happened?

570
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:44,442
- I...
- Tinker Bell,

571
00:51:44,545 --> 00:51:45,944
what did you think you were doing?

572
00:51:46,046 --> 00:51:48,571
I was just... I was just trying to...

573
00:51:48,682 --> 00:51:50,707
I thought if I could capture
the thistles, then...

574
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:54,481
There isn't a garden fairy alive
who can control those weeds!

575
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:57,284
- What were you trying to prove?
- I...

576
00:51:57,391 --> 00:52:00,326
She's right, Tink.
This has all gone too far.

577
00:52:04,264 --> 00:52:06,255
By the second star!

578
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:12,233
All the preparations for spring...
How did this...

579
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:25,641
Queen Clarion, it was me.

580
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:28,819
I did it. It was all my fault.

581
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,222
Tinker Bell.

582
00:52:32,426 --> 00:52:33,893
I...

583
00:52:34,895 --> 00:52:36,226
I'm sorry.

584
00:52:51,811 --> 00:52:54,245
I don't think we can
fix this in time.

585
00:52:54,347 --> 00:52:57,407
We're going to have to cancel spring,
or postpone it at the very least.

586
00:52:57,517 --> 00:52:59,781
What, and put my
snowflake fairies back to work? Oh, no.

587
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:01,478
But we can't! We can't do that!

588
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:02,747
If the snow isn't melted,

589
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:05,033
the seedlings won't grow,
the fruit won't ripen in the summer...

590
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:07,457
And in the autumn,
there will be nothing to harvest.

591
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,925
Spring must happen on time,

592
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:10,757
or the balance of nature
will be undone!

593
00:53:10,863 --> 00:53:13,957
There must be something we can do!
Certainly this has happened before!

594
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:16,296
It has!
Did you ever hear of the Ice Age?

595
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,370
Settle down, all of you.

596
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:23,609
Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo
everything in such a short time?

597
00:53:29,715 --> 00:53:32,115
- No.
- Oh, no.

598
00:53:32,218 --> 00:53:34,743
We were so close,
and now it's all gone.

599
00:53:34,854 --> 00:53:36,548
Who's going to paint
our leaves now?

600
00:53:36,655 --> 00:53:38,316
The apples and pumpkins
will never grow.

601
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,414
No rolling hills
covered in daffodils?

602
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:42,584
And it took months to harvest
all those seeds!

603
00:53:42,694 --> 00:53:44,127
Animals waking
from hibernation

604
00:53:44,229 --> 00:53:46,197
will have nothing to eat!

605
00:54:13,925 --> 00:54:15,449
You okay, Tink?

606
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:18,688
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

607
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:24,624
I just came hoping to get a quick refill.
I'm going away for a while.

608
00:54:25,437 --> 00:54:26,437
Oh.

609
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:30,968
- Well, how long you going to be gone?
- Well, actually, forever.

610
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,539
Forever? Well,

611
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,842
in that case,
a double scoop.

612
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,078
Forever's a pretty long time, so I hear.

613
00:54:42,186 --> 00:54:43,676
Thanks, Terence.

614
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:45,414
You know my name?

615
00:54:45,522 --> 00:54:47,888
Well, sure. Why wouldn't I?

616
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:50,955
I don't know.
I'm just a dust-keeper guy.

617
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:55,023
I'm not exactly seen as the most
important fairy in Pixie Hollow.

618
00:54:55,132 --> 00:54:57,032
Terence, what are you talking about?

619
00:54:57,134 --> 00:54:59,568
You're probably the most important one
there is!

620
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,968
Without you,
no one would have any magic!

621
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:04,768
Why, your talent makes you
who you are!

622
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:08,210
- You should be proud of it! I mean...
- I am.

623
00:55:16,987 --> 00:55:19,854
I'd better get going.

624
00:55:57,126 --> 00:55:58,525
Hey, Cheese.

625
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:03,593
"Be proud of your talent." What talent?

626
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,160
I couldn't even get
these silly things to work.

627
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:21,782
Lost things.

628
00:56:37,232 --> 00:56:38,563
That's it!

629
00:56:48,076 --> 00:56:49,839
Attention, everyone!

630
00:56:51,546 --> 00:56:54,037
I'm afraid I have distressing news.

631
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,448
There is no way spring
can come on time.

632
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:01,619
Months of work was lost,

633
00:57:01,723 --> 00:57:04,283
and it will take us months
to restore it all.

634
00:57:05,027 --> 00:57:07,655
So when the Everblossom
opens tomorrow,

635
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:11,727
I'm afraid we will not be going
to the mainland for spring.

636
00:57:13,835 --> 00:57:16,804
Wait! I know how we can fix everything!

637
00:57:18,273 --> 00:57:19,672
Tinker Bell?

638
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:24,278
Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...

639
00:57:24,379 --> 00:57:27,313
Just hear me out. Please.

640
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:29,507
You!

641
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,516
How long does it take you
to paint a ladybug?

642
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:38,524
I don't know. 10, 15 minutes, I guess.

643
00:57:56,277 --> 00:58:00,043
See? We can build more.
I can show you how.

644
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:03,844
Making paint, gathering seeds,
we can do it all in no time.

645
00:58:04,418 --> 00:58:06,386
We have to at least try!

646
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:10,281
Wait a...
Are we really gonna listen to her?

647
00:58:10,558 --> 00:58:13,118
She's the reason we're in this mess
in the first place!

648
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:15,058
But I can fix it.

649
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:19,758
Yippee! Tinker Bell's going to save us
with her dopey little doohickeys.

650
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:23,463
- Hide the squirrels!
- What is your problem, Vidia?

651
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:25,414
Why do you think
you're so much better than me?

652
00:58:25,438 --> 00:58:28,896
I am better than you, sweetie.
I didn't ruin spring.

653
00:58:29,008 --> 00:58:31,101
At least now I'm trying to help.

654
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:33,645
Have you ever helped anyone
besides yourself?

655
00:58:33,746 --> 00:58:35,543
Well, I tried to help you!

656
00:58:35,648 --> 00:58:37,548
Maybe I should have told you
to capture the hawk

657
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,584
instead of the thistles!

658
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:50,414
Perhaps Tinker Bell was not
the only one responsible.

659
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:56,155
It seems to me that
your fast-flying talent is well-suited

660
00:58:56,262 --> 00:58:59,663
to chasing down each and every one
of the thistles.

661
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:01,023
Me?

662
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:04,828
Yes. And I expect them all
to be returned to Needlepoint Meadow

663
00:59:04,937 --> 00:59:05,937
as soon as possible.

664
00:59:06,038 --> 00:59:08,438
But that could take forever!

665
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:10,839
Then I suggest you get started.

666
00:59:20,552 --> 00:59:24,989
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you sure you can do this?

667
00:59:27,993 --> 00:59:29,051
Yes.

668
00:59:30,395 --> 00:59:34,024
Because I'm a tinker. It's who I am.

669
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:37,934
And tinkers fix things.

670
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:41,506
But I can't do it alone.

671
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:46,841
Command us, Miss Bell.

672
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:49,570
- I'll help.
- Show us how, Tink!

673
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:51,649
- I'll help you.
- Me, too!

674
00:59:51,917 --> 00:59:57,617
Okay, gather up all the twigs you can,
all different sizes, and tree sap.

675
00:59:57,722 --> 01:00:01,089
We need lots of that.
But most importantly,

676
01:00:01,193 --> 01:00:04,720
we need to find lost things.

677
01:00:13,505 --> 01:00:15,200
Okay, what have you got?

678
01:00:15,307 --> 01:00:17,297
- How about this?
- Will this do?

679
01:00:17,408 --> 01:00:19,501
Can you use this fuzzy thing,
Miss Bell?

680
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,975
- Oh, yeah!
- It's not fuzzy.

681
01:00:21,078 --> 01:00:23,512
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

682
01:00:26,817 --> 01:00:28,045
Twig.

683
01:00:28,152 --> 01:00:29,744
Hammer.

684
01:00:29,854 --> 01:00:32,721
Magnification, please. Thank you.

685
01:00:34,925 --> 01:00:36,893
And that's how you do it!

686
01:00:39,096 --> 01:00:41,360
Now, what do you suppose the...

687
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:54,202
You smell funny.

688
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,880
Oh!

689
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:01,316
- I saw it first.
- I bumped into it.

690
01:01:02,152 --> 01:01:04,143
Just tie this off here.

691
01:01:04,588 --> 01:01:09,287
So, you just squeeze this,
then let it go, and...

692
01:01:10,594 --> 01:01:12,357
See? Simple!

693
01:01:15,365 --> 01:01:16,593
Now, just put the berries in,

694
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:18,758
and we'll have plenty of paint
in no time!

695
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:58,372
Six, seven and eight.

696
01:02:54,796 --> 01:02:58,288
You did it, Tinker Bell.
You saved spring.

697
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:01,066
We all did it.

698
01:03:01,169 --> 01:03:04,332
Queen Clarion? Can't Tink
come with us to the mainland?

699
01:03:04,439 --> 01:03:07,464
Yeah, she's done so much
for everyone.

700
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:11,143
No, no, you guys, really.
I don't need to go.

701
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:13,903
Buttercup, it's what you wanted.

702
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:16,575
It's okay. My work is here.

703
01:03:16,684 --> 01:03:18,652
And I still have so much to do. I gotta...

704
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,516
Not here, you don't!

705
01:03:20,688 --> 01:03:22,451
Well... But I don't...

706
01:03:24,492 --> 01:03:25,789
Surprise, Miss Bell.

707
01:03:25,893 --> 01:03:28,862
We found your tiny dancer!

708
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:33,730
Actually, I ran across this myself
many seasons ago.

709
01:03:34,335 --> 01:03:37,600
I didn't have a clue what it was
or how to fix it.

710
01:03:38,305 --> 01:03:43,504
But you did, Tinker Bell.
You are quite a rare talent indeed.

711
01:03:44,578 --> 01:03:48,708
And I'd imagine there's a little girl
out there who's missing this.

712
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,418
What do you mean? How...

713
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:54,181
I think that perhaps
a certain tinker fairy

714
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,813
might have a job to do after all,

715
01:03:56,924 --> 01:03:58,221
on the mainland.

716
01:03:58,325 --> 01:03:59,849
You mean, I...

717
01:04:03,597 --> 01:04:04,974
- I knew you'd get to go!
- Oh, Tink!

718
01:04:04,998 --> 01:04:07,057
- We can help, Miss Bell.
- We can help. I'm strong.

719
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:10,398
I'm so happy for you.
Come on. We gotta go line up.

720
01:04:11,471 --> 01:04:13,439
Thank you, Your Highness.

721
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:16,008
But how will I find who it belongs to?

722
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:18,009
You'll know. Now go!

723
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:27,619
Good heavens.

724
01:04:28,421 --> 01:04:29,718
Thank you.

725
01:04:35,295 --> 01:04:38,458
Tink. Hey,
something to help you on the mainland.

726
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,691
Terence, that's so sweet.

727
01:04:45,305 --> 01:04:46,897
Good luck, Tink.

728
01:04:47,307 --> 01:04:51,266
To the air, fairies! To the air!
The mainland awaits!

729
01:04:52,946 --> 01:04:57,849
(SINGING) Come away
with me now to the sky

730
01:04:57,951 --> 01:05:01,852
Up o'er the hills and the sea

731
01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:06,357
Far beyond where our memories lie

732
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:10,758
To a place where I'm free to be me

733
01:05:13,132 --> 01:05:16,966
Oh gather ye now one and all

734
01:05:17,069 --> 01:05:21,768
No matter what all ye may do

735
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:26,641
Let the stars fill your soul
when the moon cradles all

736
01:05:26,745 --> 01:05:31,648
So to yourself be true

737
01:05:33,051 --> 01:05:37,818
The blanket of snow is all gone

738
01:05:37,923 --> 01:05:41,791
Each flower waits for the sun

739
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:46,354
And the whispering tears of the rain

740
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:50,902
Holds promise for everyone

741
01:05:51,003 --> 01:05:54,837
Then come away with me friends

742
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:59,433
No matter where you call your home

743
01:05:59,544 --> 01:06:03,310
With a light in our hearts
We will never part

744
01:06:03,414 --> 01:06:05,279
Fairies to the north!

745
01:06:05,783 --> 01:06:07,717
Fairies to the south!

746
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:09,682
To the east and west!

747
01:06:20,565 --> 01:06:24,661
Deep in the forest we go

748
01:06:24,769 --> 01:06:26,100
The creatures are all fast asleep

749
01:06:26,204 --> 01:06:30,766
Wake up, sleepyheads!
Come on! There you go. Good squirrel.

750
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,675
With a kiss and a wink
we will waken our souls

751
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:36,338
While always their safety we'll keep

752
01:06:36,447 --> 01:06:40,247
And then, then we'll dance
through the night

753
01:06:40,384 --> 01:06:44,582
Till the sunbeams sparkle at dawn

754
01:06:44,689 --> 01:06:49,092
And away we will go
Like last winter's snow

755
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:52,754
Soon our work will be done

756
01:06:52,864 --> 01:06:56,663
Oh gather ye now one and all

757
01:06:56,766 --> 01:07:00,725
No matter what all ye may do

758
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:05,331
Let the stars fill your soul
when the moon cradles all

759
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:11,708
So to yourself be true

760
01:07:25,161 --> 01:07:29,120
Oh gather ye now one and all

761
01:07:29,232 --> 01:07:33,259
No matter what all ye may do

762
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:38,000
Let the stars fill your soul
when the moon cradles all

763
01:07:38,108 --> 01:07:42,511
So to yourself be true

764
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:56,080
So to yourself be true

765
01:09:52,572 --> 01:09:54,802
Mummy! Guess what, guess what!

766
01:09:54,975 --> 01:09:57,307
Yes, Wendy.
What is it, darling?

767
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,781
A fairy's work is
much more than,

768
01:10:05,886 --> 01:10:06,944
at first, it might appear.

769
01:10:07,054 --> 01:10:08,419
You did it!

770
01:10:09,322 --> 01:10:12,951
Suppose your broken clock ticks,
though it hasn't in a year.

771
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:18,621
Perchance you find a toy you lost,
or jingling bells you hear.

772
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:26,770
It all means that
one very special fairy might be near.

773
01:10:43,589 --> 01:10:47,787
(SINGING) Watch all the flowers
dance with the wind

774
01:10:47,893 --> 01:10:52,262
Listen to snowflakes
whisper your name

775
01:10:52,364 --> 01:10:55,891
Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams

776
01:10:56,001 --> 01:11:00,870
You can fly

777
01:11:00,973 --> 01:11:05,137
Fly to who you are

778
01:11:05,244 --> 01:11:09,305
Climb upon your star

779
01:11:09,415 --> 01:11:13,749
You believe you'll find your wings

780
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:20,782
Fly to your heart

781
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:26,588
Touch every rainbow painting the sky

782
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,829
Look at the magic glide
through your life

783
01:11:30,936 --> 01:11:34,599
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night

784
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:39,542
You can fly

785
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:43,944
Fly to who you are

786
01:11:44,048 --> 01:11:48,075
Climb upon your star

787
01:11:48,186 --> 01:11:52,555
When you believe
you'll find your wings

788
01:11:52,657 --> 01:11:56,218
Fly

789
01:11:56,327 --> 01:12:00,423
You can fly

790
01:12:00,532 --> 01:12:04,730
To your heart

791
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:13,805
Rise to the heights of all you can be

792
01:12:16,314 --> 01:12:22,549
Soar on the hope of marvelous things

793
01:12:22,654 --> 01:12:27,023
Fly to who you are

794
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:31,186
Climb upon your star

795
01:12:31,296 --> 01:12:35,562
When you believe
you'll find your wings

796
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:39,864
Fly

797
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:44,066
Everywhere you go

798
01:12:44,174 --> 01:12:48,508
Your soul will find a home

799
01:12:48,612 --> 01:12:54,787
You'll be free
to spread your wings

800
01:12:54,985 --> 01:12:58,546
Fly

801
01:12:58,655 --> 01:13:05,618
You can fly

802
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:10,063
To your heart

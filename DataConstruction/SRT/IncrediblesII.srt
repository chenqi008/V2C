1
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:54,993
File 82-712.

2
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,245
Agent Rick Dicker
interrogating.

3
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:58,747
State your name, please.

4
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,753
Uh, Tony. Tony Rydinger.

5
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:09,257
Tell me about the incident.

6
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:12,651
Well, there's this girl,
um, in my class.

7
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:14,111
I saw her at the track meet.

8
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:17,073
You're, uh, Violet, right?
That's me.

9
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,116
I sort of knew her,
but she'd changed.

10
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:21,077
Relaxed.
She was more sure of herself.

11
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:22,411
Cool, cute.

12
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,871
I asked her out to a movie.

13
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:24,955
So, Friday?

14
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,082
Friday.
Friday.

15
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:27,583
And I went to watch
the track meet.

16
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:31,629
Not long after, this thing
happened in the parking lot.

17
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,646
Behold! The Underminer!

18
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:53,484
I am always beneath you,
but nothing is beneath me!

19
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,236
As if things aren't
weird enough,

20
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,946
I look over
and I see these boots.

21
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:58,155
You two, stay here.

22
00:01:58,322 --> 00:01:59,782
Wait.
Should we be doing this?

23
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:01,117
It is still illegal.

24
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:02,576
They looked like superheroes.

25
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,412
We're gonna lose him.
Oh, all right.

26
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:05,788
One of you patrol
the perimeter,

27
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:06,956
keep the crowds back and safe.

28
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,124
The other,
watch after Jack-Jack.

29
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,333
But I thought
we were gonna go with...

30
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:10,418
You heard your mother.

31
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:12,086
Trampoline me.

32
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,259
I call perimeter!

33
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:19,427
You're not
going anywhere,

34
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,178
you little maggoty creep!

35
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:22,847
I see my chance
to get out of there.

36
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:26,475
But there's something familiar
about one of the kids' voices.

37
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:28,144
The girl, she's upset

38
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:29,603
and she throws down
her mask...

39
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,147
and it's her!

40
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:32,648
Oh. Tony!

41
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:33,983
Hi.

42
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,818
Uh, this isn't
what you think it is.

43
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,445
It was just getting
too freaky.

44
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:39,280
I couldn't handle it
and ran off.

45
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,073
I feel kinda bad about it.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,868
Maybe I should've said
hi or something?

47
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:45,995
It's not her fault
superheroes are illegal.

48
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:47,997
And it's not like
I don't like strong girls.

49
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:50,332
I'm pretty secure
manhood-wise.

50
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,500
What is that?

51
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:54,462
Have you told anyone else
about this? Your parents?

52
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:56,380
No, they'd only think
I was hiding something.

53
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,841
You know what I mean?
Sure, kid.

54
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,092
I like this girl, Mr. Dicker.

55
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,303
I'm supposed to go out
with her Friday night.

56
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,014
Now, things are just
gonna be weird.

57
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,534
I wish I could forget
I ever saw her in that suit.

58
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,077
You Will, kid.

59
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:12,496
You will.

60
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,863
Come on!

61
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,801
Consider yourself undermined!

62
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,775
Ooh.

63
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,119
Underminer! We meet again...
Huh?

64
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:22,086
Oh, great!
Now, he's on the agenda.

65
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,977
Incredible!

66
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:40,395
Meet Jack Hammer!

67
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,000
Buh-bye!

68
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,517
No, no, no! No, no, no!

69
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:18,094
Everybody, stay back!
Okay? Stay back!

70
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,473
You're not sticking me
with babysitting!

71
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:30,356
I can't steer it or stop it.
And the Underminer's escaped!

72
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:32,441
We'll have to stop it...
Bob! The monorail!

73
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,575
Frozone! Yeah!

74
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:47,456
We have to stop this thing

75
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,707
before it gets
to the overpass!

76
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:51,377
I'll try to keep it away
from the buildings!

77
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:02,972
Hey, lady!

78
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,518
Thank you so much, young man!

79
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:13,691
What?

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,401
Violet!

81
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,489
Ahh!

82
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:30,916
Stop!

83
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,335
Everybody, stop!

84
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,617
Heads up, Dad!
Dash!

85
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,455
Violet!
Who's watching Jack-Jack?

86
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:10,623
Dash is watching him!

87
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,458
Violet, here, you take him!

88
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:23,886
It's headed for City Hall!

89
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:26,972
Mom needs help!

90
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,896
They're out in public again!
This is our chance!

91
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:36,106
Follow them, follow Frozone!

92
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:52,915
Bob!
Help me with the boiler!

93
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:10,933
That should do it!

94
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,935
What are you kids doing?
Get out of here!

95
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,311
This thing's gonna blow!

96
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:16,021
There's no time!

97
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,827
We did it!

98
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:31,328
Freeze, Supers!

99
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,706
Oh, What did we do?

100
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,337
Excuse me, Mr. Zone?

101
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:45,301
Sorry, but I'm not
really supposed to be here.

102
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,136
Which seems wrong...

103
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:48,470
doesn't it?

104
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:52,224
Perhaps you'd be interested in
changing that law?

105
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:55,607
Superheroes including Frozone,

106
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,317
Mr. Incredible,
and Elastigirl...

107
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:59,569
caused further damage
to the city.

108
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,780
The Underminer
remains at large.

109
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:03,573
We didn't start this fight.

110
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,783
Well, you didn't
finish it either!

111
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:07,160
Did you stop the Underminer
from inflicting more damage?

112
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,370
No.

113
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:09,537
Did you stop him
from robbing the banks?

114
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:11,505
No.
Did you catch him?

115
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:13,715
No.
The banks were insured.

116
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,217
We have infrastructure
in place

117
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,343
to deal with these matters.

118
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,178
If you had simply
done nothing...

119
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:19,763
everything would now be

120
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,098
proceeding
in an orderly fashion.

121
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:23,558
You'd have preferred
we do nothing?

122
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:25,268
Without a doubt.

123
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:30,899
You weren't much help.

124
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,943
Do you want out of the hole?

125
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,113
First you gotta
put down the shovel.

126
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,992
Well, that went poorly.

127
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:43,954
Dad, this is probably

128
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:47,332
not the best time
to tell you about this...

129
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,335
but something else
happened today with a kid...

130
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:53,171
and my mask.

131
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:07,853
Oh, hey, Rick.

132
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:10,564
Violet thinks a friend
of hers, a kid named Tony...

133
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:13,483
might have seen her in the
outfit, without her mask.

134
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,527
Talkative type?
Don't know.

135
00:10:15,694 --> 00:10:16,945
Last name is Rydinger.

136
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:19,197
Tony Rydinger.

137
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:20,949
I'll check it out.

138
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:22,451
Bob, Helen...

139
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:25,036
a word if you don't mind.

140
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:27,914
Uh, the program's been
shut down.

141
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:29,207
What?

142
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,334
Politicians
don't understand people...

143
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:34,629
who do good simply
because it's right.

144
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:36,423
It makes 'em nervous.

145
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,134
They've been gunning
for Supers for years.

146
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,428
Today was all they needed.

147
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,388
Anyway...

148
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,723
I'm done.

149
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,975
I'm afraid two more weeks
in the motel

150
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,351
is the best I can do for ya.

151
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:49,561
It ain't much.

152
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:50,771
You've done plenty, Rick.

153
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:52,522
We won't forget.

154
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:54,733
Well, it has been
a great honor

155
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,151
working with you good people.

156
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:58,653
Thanks for everything,
and good luck.

157
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,114
Yeah. You, too.

158
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,214
Did you wash your hands?

159
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:21,009
With soap?

160
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:24,596
Did you dry them?

161
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:33,188
What? Is this all vegetables?
Who ordered all vegetables?

162
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:35,065
I did. They're good
and you're going to have some.

163
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:39,110
Are we going to talk about it?

164
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:41,363
What?
The elephant in the room.

165
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,782
What elephant?
I guess not then.

166
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:44,950
You're referring to today.

167
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,785
Yeah, what's the deal
with today?

168
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:48,203
We all made mistakes.

169
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,621
For example,

170
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:51,248
you kids were supposed
to watch Jack-Jack.

171
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:54,626
Babysitting, while you guys
did the important stuff.

172
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:55,710
We talked about this.

173
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:57,838
You're not old enough
to decide about these things.

174
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,965
We are old enough to help out.
Yeah!

175
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:01,633
Isn't that what you tell us,
Dad?

176
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,095
Yeah, well, help out can
mean many different things.

177
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:06,847
But we're supposed to help,
if there's trouble.

178
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,931
Well, yeah, but...
Aren't you

179
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:09,891
-glad we helped today?
Yeah, I know but...

180
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:11,059
You said that you were
proud of us.

181
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:12,894
Well, yeah, I was. Am!

182
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,521
We wanna fight bad guys!

183
00:12:14,604 --> 00:12:16,857
No, you don't!

184
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:19,568
You said things
were different now.

185
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:21,903
And they were, on the island.

186
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,572
But I didn't mean
that from now on...

187
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:26,241
So now, we've gotta go back to
never using our powers.

188
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:27,701
It defines who I am.

189
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:29,411
We're not saying you have...

190
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:31,454
What?
Someone on TV said it.

191
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:33,039
Can we just eat?

192
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:35,834
The dinner, while it's hot?

193
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:37,502
Did we do something wrong?

194
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:38,962
Yes.
No.

195
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,381
We didn't do anything wrong.

196
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:43,842
Superheroes are illegal.

197
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,635
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

198
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:48,680
The law should be fair.
What are we teaching our kids?

199
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:49,848
To respect the law!

200
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,516
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

201
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:54,227
If laws are unjust,
there are laws to change them!

202
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:55,520
Otherwise, it's chaos!

203
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,564
Which is exactly what we have!

204
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:05,655
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

205
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:09,534
What was?
Fighting crime as a family.

206
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:12,454
It was cool.

207
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,749
But it's over.
The world is what it is.

208
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,918
We have to adapt.

209
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:19,669
Are things bad?

210
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:21,296
Things are fine.

211
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:23,757
May I be excused?

212
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:29,971
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

213
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:33,725
Uh...
Not much longer. honey.

214
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:42,025
What are we gonna do?

215
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:43,652
I don't know.

216
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:45,403
Maybe Dicker
will find something?

217
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,863
Dicker is done, Bob.

218
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,116
Any thought we had about being
Supers again is fantasy.

219
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,826
One of us has gotta get a job.

220
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:53,119
One of us?

221
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:55,246
You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

222
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,998
Hated every minute of it.

223
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:58,833
I know it was hard on you.

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,669
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

225
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:01,753
and you take care
of the kids...

226
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,881
No, I'm doing this.
I need to do this.

227
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:07,759
You know
where my suit and ties are?

228
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:08,927
Burned up when...

229
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:11,012
The jet destroyed our house.

230
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,555
Yeah.

231
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:15,141
We can't count
on anyone else now, Bob.

232
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:16,476
It's just us.

233
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,769
We can't wait for...

234
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,655
No lifeguard on duty!

235
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:30,281
Swim at your own risk.

236
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:31,825
Oh, where'd you go today?

237
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,077
Inoflced
you missed all the fun.

238
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:36,788
Don't be mad because
I know when to leave a party.

239
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:38,331
I'm just as illegal
as you guys.

240
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:41,042
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

241
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,711
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

242
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,379
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

243
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:47,173
I heard the program shut down.

244
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,050
How much longer
are you in this motel?

245
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:50,343
Two weeks.

246
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,137
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

247
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:54,514
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

248
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,224
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

249
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,851
Well, door's always open.

250
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:00,145
You know,
the news isn't all bad.

251
00:15:00,311 --> 00:15:02,981
While you guys
were being detained...

252
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:06,693
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

253
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,876
Winston Deavor.
Wants to talk...

254
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,212
with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

255
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:13,630
I checked him out.

256
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:14,798
He's legit.

257
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,508
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

258
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,719
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

259
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,429
We just came from the
police station, Lucius.

260
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:21,555
When?

261
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,756
Tonight. I'm going there now.

262
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,384
You enjoy,
I'm sitting this one out.

263
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,052
He wants all three of us.

264
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,722
Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

265
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,350
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

266
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,519
Go in our Supersuits?

267
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,979
Yeah.

268
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,606
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

269
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,609
Got a feeling he's nostalgic.

270
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,115
Where are you going?

271
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,617
The fresh air
is especially good tonight.

272
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,785
If Jack-Jack wakes up...

273
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,537
I know the drill.

274
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,967
Your security badges.
Please, this way.

275
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,427
Hey, listen,
you're my biggest fan.

276
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,595
Good to see you.

277
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,472
I'm your biggest fan.
Shoofl

278
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,082
I love superheroes!

279
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,376
The powers, the costumes...

280
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,086
the mythic struggles.

281
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,255
Winston Deavor.
You can call me Win.

282
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,632
Genuine pleasure to meet you.

283
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,342
Frozone!
It's good to see you.

284
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,885
EIastigirl.
Nice to meet you.

285
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,887
Mr. Incredible!
Hello.

286
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,141
4“ Incredible

287
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,865
a“ Frozone a“

288
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,283
Yeah!

289
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,953
Can't tell you what a thrill
this is. And this...

290
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,915
Oh, hello there, superheroes.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

291
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,000
...is my tardy sister, Evelyn.

292
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,504
And I'm scolding myself
so you don't have to, Winston!

293
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,838
Spectacular.

294
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,383
My father was so proud

295
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,511
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

296
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,846
He used to call you
the last line of defense.

297
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,765
He was your top supporter.

298
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,184
He donated
to superhero causes.

299
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,686
He raised money

300
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,479
for the Dynaguy statue
in Avery Park.

301
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,481
He got to know
many Supers personally.

302
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,316
Even installed a phone

303
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,278
with direct lines
to Gazerbeam and Fironic...

304
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,904
in case of emergencies.

305
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,490
He loved that,
showed it off to everyone.

306
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,866
He was heartbroken

307
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,410
when you were all forced
to go underground.

308
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,161
Father believed the world

309
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,997
would become more dangerous
without you.

310
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,333
He didn't know
how right he was.

311
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,794
There was a break-in.

312
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,048
My father called Gazerbeam.

313
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,717
The direct line.

314
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,260
No answer.

315
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,263
He called Fironic, no answer.

316
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,682
Superheroes had just been
made illegal...

317
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,518
The robbers discovered him
on the phone...

318
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,020
-and shot him.
{GUNSHOT

319
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,106
So...

320
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,108
It must've been hard.

321
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,735
Especially for Mother.

322
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,988
She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.

323
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,782
If superheroes had not been
forced underground...

324
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,159
it never would've happened.

325
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,661
Or Dad could've taken Mom
to the safe room

326
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,829
as soon as he knew
there was trouble.

327
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,456
I disagree strongly!

328
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,499
But we're not going
into it right now.

329
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,585
The point is...

330
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,503
nobody expected us

331
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,089
to be able to actually run
Dad's company.

332
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,676
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...

333
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,262
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

334
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,847
into what it is today.

335
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,475
A world-class
telecommunications company.

336
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,809
Bigger than ever.

337
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,021
Perfectly positioned to make
some wrong things right.

338
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,939
Hence, this meeting.

339
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,524
Let me ask you something.

340
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,318
What is the main reason

341
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,111
you were all
forced underground?

342
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,238
Ignorance.
Perception.

343
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,491
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

344
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,784
Difficult situation.

345
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,244
You were faced
with a lot of hard decisions.

346
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,496
Oh, tell me about it.

347
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,872
I can't.

348
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,375
Because I didn't see it...

349
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,293
neither did anyone else.

350
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,629
So, when you fight bad guys
like today...

351
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,382
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

352
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,717
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

353
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,470
They see destruction
and they see you.

354
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,305
So, if we wanna change

355
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,641
people's perceptions
about superheroes...

356
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,017
we need you

357
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,436
to share your perceptions
with the world.

358
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,480
How do we do that?
With cameras.

359
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,567
We need you to share your
perceptions with the world.

360
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,902
How do we do that?

361
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,071
We embed tiny cameras,
like those,

362
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,364
into your Supersuits.

363
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,657
Wow, so small.

364
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,200
And the picture
is outstanding.

365
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,785
Thanks! Designed 'em myself.

366
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,537
We've got resources,
lobbyists,

367
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,955
worldwide connections...

368
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,290
and very important, insurance.

369
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,667
Insurance is key.

370
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,128
All we need now
are the super-est superheroes.

371
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,547
It needs you three.
Come on!

372
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,758
Help me make all Supers
legal again.

373
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,385
This sounds great!

374
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,470
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

375
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,639
That enthusiasm is golden.

376
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,975
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move...

377
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,978
Well, Elastigirl
is our best play.

378
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,273
Better than me?

379
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,692
I mean, she's good.

380
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,861
Really, a credit to her...

381
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,655
You know.
You know.

382
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:40,865
With great respect...

383
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,283
let's not test the whole

384
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,951
insurance-will-pay-
for-everything idea...

385
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,370
on the first go 'round, okay?

386
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,832
Wait a minute.
You're saying what? I'm messy?

387
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,876
Well, Evelyn did
a cost-benefit analysis...

388
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,295
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

389
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,963
before going underground.

390
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,965
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

391
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,050
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

392
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,761
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

393
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,472
Of course! We're gonna solve

394
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,515
all kinds
of problems together.

395
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:11,061
After the perfect launch
with EIastigirl!

396
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,647
So, what do you say?

397
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,650
What do I say?

398
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,653
I don't know.

399
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,614
What do you mean,
you don't know?

400
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,908
A few hours ago,
you were saying it was over...

401
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,202
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

402
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,204
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

403
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,580
and you don't know?

404
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,875
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!

405
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,460
So do I.

406
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,253
From jail, Bob!

407
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,546
And how do you do that?

408
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,924
By turning down a chance
to change the law

409
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,383
that forces them to hide
what they are?

410
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,928
They haven't decided what
they are. They're still kids.

411
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,430
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers...

412
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,891
whether they decide
to use those powers or not.

413
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,184
This will benefit them.

414
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,144
It's not a good time
to be away.

415
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,771
Dash is having trouble
with homework...

416
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,689
Vi is worried
about her first date

417
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,024
with that boy she likes,
Tony...

418
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,192
and Jack-Jack...

419
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,152
Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?

420
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,321
Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.

421
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,032
But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

422
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,784
I'm just not sure I can leave.

423
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,202
Of course you can leave.

424
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,371
You've got to. So that I...

425
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,331
we can be Supers again,

426
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,083
so our kids can have
that choice.

427
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,043
So you can have that choice.

428
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,378
All right, yes!

429
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,713
So I can have that choice.

430
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,466
And I would do a great job!

431
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,845
Regardless of what Deavor's
pie charts say or whatever...

432
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,056
But they want you.

433
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,767
And you'll do a great...

434
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,936
job...

435
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,729
too.

436
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,942
Well, that
was excruciating to watch.

437
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,403
I can't lie to you.

438
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,573
It's nice to be wanted.
Flattering, you know, but...

439
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,740
But what's the choice?

440
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,033
One, do this right,

441
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,326
get well paid,
we're out of the motel...

442
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,287
and things get better
for all Supers,

443
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,538
including our kids.

444
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,248
Or two...

445
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,834
I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.

446
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,253
You know it's crazy, right?

447
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,505
To help my family,
I gotta leave it.

448
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,756
To fix the law,
I gotta break it.

449
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,841
You'll be great.

450
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:04,925
I know I Will.

451
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,176
But what about you?
We have kids.

452
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,886
I'll watch the kids,
no problem.

453
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,555
Easy.
Easy, huh?

454
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,265
You're adorable.

455
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,433
Well, if there is a problem,

456
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,767
I'II drop this thing
and come right back.

457
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,102
You won't need to.

458
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,271
I got it,
you go do this thing.

459
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,982
Do it so...

460
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,276
I can do it better.

461
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,737
Deavor here.

462
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,196
This is Elastigirl.

463
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,406
I'm in.

464
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,412
Mr. Deavor, it's wonderful...

465
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,064
but it's too generous.

466
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:36,482
Nonsense!
That's the least we can do.

467
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,109
We're partners now!

468
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:39,944
Can't have my partners
living in a motel.

469
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:42,530
But whose house?
Is it a house?

470
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:44,240
It's my house.
I have several.

471
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm not using that one.
Stay as long as you need.

472
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,327
I don't know what to say.

473
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,329
How about thanks?

474
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:53,526
This is our new house?

475
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:56,821
Okay, easy, tiger.
It's being loaned to us.

476
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:58,864
This is homey.

477
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,116
Look at this place.

478
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,910
Deavor bought it from
an eccentric billionaire...

479
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:04,620
who liked to come and go
without being seen...

480
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:07,164
so the house
has multiple hidden exits.

481
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:08,874
Good thing we won't stand out.

482
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,836
Wouldn't want to attract
any unnecessary attention.

483
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:13,921
It's got a big yard!

484
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:16,006
Isn't this a bit much?

485
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:17,967
Near a forest!

486
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:19,760
Would you rather be
at the motel?

487
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:22,221
And a pool!

488
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:24,515
What exactly is Mom's new job?

489
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:26,934
The important thing is
we're out of the motel.

490
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,395
I like Mom's new job!

491
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:32,440
Oh, ho, ho!

492
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:38,154
Whoa.

493
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,488
Whoa.

494
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,701
Well, check out
the water features.

495
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,329
Oh!
Wow.

496
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:50,958
Wicked cool!

497
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:58,466
Hey! Dash! Stop it!

498
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,384
Not the couch! Stop it!
No! Dash!

499
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:01,677
Stop!

500
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:02,970
Don't touch the buttons!
The couch!

501
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:04,138
Dash!
No!

502
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:06,098
No, no!

503
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:07,933
Oh, no.
Oh, boy.

504
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:11,771
This isn't me.

505
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:15,691
I'm not all dark and angsty.

506
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:16,942
I'm Elastigirl.

507
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:18,903
I'm, you know, flexible.

508
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:20,279
E designed this?

509
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:23,324
No, some guy named
Alexander Galbaki.

510
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:25,534
Glad it's you and not me,

511
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:28,037
'cause you're gonna
hear from her.

512
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:29,413
This note came with it.

513
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:30,498
What?

514
00:25:37,514 --> 00:25:39,557
A new Elasticycle.

515
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:42,227
Elasticycle?
I didn't know you had a bike.

516
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:43,603
Hey, I had a mohawk.

517
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:45,063
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

518
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,107
Yeah, but...
A mohawk?

519
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:49,275
Ah, you didn't miss anything.

520
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,337
Oh, yeah!
This one's electric.

521
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:57,424
What's that mean?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

522
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:03,138
Means it's torque-y.
I'll get the hang of it.

523
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,264
You will be great.

524
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:06,224
I will be great.
And you will, too.

525
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:07,893
We will both be great.

526
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,186
Bye, sweetie.

527
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,251
Wait a minute!

528
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:34,669
Is that Elastigirl?
I think that's Elastigirl.

529
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:37,005
Hey! EIastigirl!

530
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:45,222
Marry me, EIastigirl!

531
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:48,809
J“ Here comes Elastigirl

532
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:51,394
No theme songs

533
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:53,563
or I'll turn this bus
right around!

534
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:58,401
Look at that.

535
00:26:58,568 --> 00:26:59,778
New Urbem.

536
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:01,613
You wanna make a big
crime fighting statement...

537
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,448
you go where the crime is big.

538
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,826
Strange thing to be
excited about, Winston.

539
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:08,161
It's like
a superhero's playground!

540
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:14,209
No Sugar Bombs
on my watch.

541
00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:18,588
Where's Mom?

542
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:19,756
She's up and out.

543
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,466
She's at her new job
doing hero work.

544
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:24,177
But I thought superheroes
were still illegal.

545
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:25,846
They are, for now.

546
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,849
So Mom is getting paid
to break the law?

547
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,225
She's not breaking...

548
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:32,644
She's an advocate
for superheroes.

549
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:33,770
It's a new job.

550
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:36,690
So, Mom is going out
illegally...

551
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:39,860
to explain why
she shouldn't be illegal.

552
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,736
Hey... Hey!

553
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,321
The bus is here!

554
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:47,325
Whoa! Grab your stuff quickly!
Go on, get on the...

555
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,287
Put your homework
in your pack!

556
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:52,455
Bye-bye!

557
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:00,964
We're gonna get along
just fine...

558
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:03,008
'cause you don't ask
any hard questions.

559
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:08,555
All right. All locations,

560
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:09,639
we need to know
where you want us.

561
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:10,849
Stand by.

562
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:14,019
Seems strange
to wait for crime.

563
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:15,770
Relax.
You're smack in the middle...

564
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:19,190
of the worst crime area
in the city. It's perfect.

565
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:20,692
It's a superhero's playground.

566
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:22,319
It's a superhero's
playground. Right.

567
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:24,112
You know,
after we went underground...

568
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,947
my husband used to listen
to a police scanner...

569
00:28:26,114 --> 00:28:27,616
waiting for something
to happen.

570
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,492
And I got mad at him for it.

571
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:32,829
Oh, I'm such a hypocrite.

572
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:34,414
All units.
Something's up.

573
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:35,624
We've been picking up
some chatter about

574
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:38,710
potential disruptions to the
hovertrain's opening ceremony.

575
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:41,504
Disruption or threat?
Both.

576
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:43,006
Station's at Fifty-Fourth
and Nottingham.

577
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,091
A potential threat!
Perfect!

578
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:47,552
Fifty-fourth and Nottingham.
Go, go, go!

579
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:52,599
Hey, Vi! I want you back here
by 10:30.

580
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:53,725
11-ish?

581
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:55,977
10-ish, heading for 9:30-ish.

582
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:58,146
10:30-ish it is.

583
00:28:58,229 --> 00:28:59,564
Enjoy the movie.

584
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:01,847
In the county of Noddoff...

585
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,974
the Frubbers of Freep...

586
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:08,896
are all giving in
to the sweet succor of sleep.

587
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:21,033
We will
control the horizontal...

588
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,202
we will control the vertical.

589
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,461
That's not the way
you're supposed to do it, Dad.

590
00:29:32,628 --> 00:29:34,255
They want us
to do it this way.

591
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:37,174
I don't know that way!
Why would they change math?

592
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:39,624
It's okay, Dad.
Math is math!

593
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,626
I'll just wait for Mom
to get back.

594
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:42,710
What?

595
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:44,837
She won't understand it
any better than I do...

596
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:46,965
The Outer Limits.

597
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,725
All over Doozle-Dorf,

598
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:54,102
the Fribbers of Frupp
are going to sleep...

599
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:56,355
cause they just
can't keep up.

600
00:29:56,521 --> 00:30:00,108
All over Doozle-Dorf,
Doozles are dozing.

601
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:04,571
Eyelids so heavy,
they're drooping.

602
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,824
Closing! The point is:

603
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:10,285
Everyone,
everyone's hitting the sack!

604
00:30:10,452 --> 00:30:13,747
Everyone's getting the sleep
that they lack.

605
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,000
Mayors often brag
about their cities...

606
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,668
and I 'm no exception.

607
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:20,087
And I'm willing to admit

608
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,214
that New Urbem
is not the only city...

609
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:24,619
Are you sure the police are
gonna be okay with this?

610
00:30:24,744 --> 00:30:26,580
Sure. You're making
life easy for them.

611
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:27,873
They still haven't forgiven us

612
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,541
for the last time we made
life easy for them.

613
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,710
I know the Chief of Police.
There won't be a problem.

614
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,003
With all due respect...

615
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,255
if you alone had handled
the Underminer...

616
00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:37,090
things would have
been different.

617
00:30:37,424 --> 00:30:38,592
I'm just saying.

618
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:40,997
...on budget
and ahead of schedule...

619
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:44,458
to launch our magnificent
new hovertrain.

620
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,044
It can get you
where you need to go

621
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:49,171
at ridiculous speeds.

622
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:52,466
The future is open
for business!

623
00:31:12,695 --> 00:31:13,988
Wait. The train has stopped.

624
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,826
It's going
the wrong direction.

625
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:21,808
It's going the wrong way.

626
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:22,976
I'm going after it.

627
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:30,317
This thing's really moving.

628
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:32,736
100 and climbing.
How much track is built?

629
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:35,405
EVELYN“. About 25 miles.

630
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:45,082
No one can shut
this thing down?

631
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:46,250
They've tried. No-go.

632
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:49,795
Is that Elastigirl?

633
00:31:57,511 --> 00:31:58,512
Overrides?

634
00:31:58,595 --> 00:31:59,721
They're locked out
of the system.

635
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:09,064
What about a fail-safe?
Not enough time.

636
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,111
Someone's calling!
Switching over.

637
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:16,071
Hey, Mom.
I can't find my high-tops

638
00:32:16,154 --> 00:32:17,197
and Dad
can't find them either.

639
00:32:17,364 --> 00:32:19,783
But he won't call you and ask,
so I am.

640
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,243
Do not call your mother!

641
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,869
Dash, honey.
Can't talk right now.

642
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:24,830
Look under your bed, okay.
How much time?

643
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:25,914
Less than two minutes!

644
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:28,667
There's a shortcut. Cut
through the culvert up ahead.

645
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,177
I don't know
if I can stay with it.

646
00:34:47,906 --> 00:34:49,532
What the heck was that?

647
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,409
Is everybody all right?
Is anybody injured?

648
00:34:51,576 --> 00:34:52,744
Are you all right?

649
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:57,790
Your story better be good.

650
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:01,628
Hey. Hey!

651
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:03,254
What happened?

652
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:37,945
Honey, why are you...

653
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,615
Don't say anything.

654
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:47,413
It's Dad. Are you okay?

655
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,458
I'm fine.
I don't wanna talk about it.

656
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,210
Tony didn't even call?

657
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:54,253
I don't wanna talk about it.

658
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,713
Oh, honey...
Dad!

659
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,634
If you want me to feel better,
then leave me alone.

660
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,801
Please?

661
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:01,928
See, there's nothing

662
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,179
a cop hates worse
than a missing child.

663
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:06,098
My kid brother's son.
Today is his first birthday.

664
00:36:06,182 --> 00:36:07,516
Oh, but if anybody

665
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,518
can find that child,
it's you, Roman.

666
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:11,354
Because you're
a wonderful policeman.

667
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:14,649
This is a holdup.

668
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:17,193
All right, get your hands up,
turn your back.

669
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,444
Put your hands
behind

670
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:19,946
your heads
and keep them there!

671
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:21,030
Don't move!

672
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:24,659
Drop that.
All right, now get over there.

673
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,786
Watch the door.

674
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:28,162
You think I 'm kiddin'?

675
00:36:31,832 --> 00:36:32,833
Now.

676
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:37,755
I said now!

677
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:40,466
I got it! Come on,
I tell you, come on!

678
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:43,928
You wanna get killed?

679
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:41,319
Uh-oh.

680
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:09,221
6268 zo<§o<3-
625:me zooooév-

681
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:21,150
No, no, no!

682
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:26,322
No!

683
00:38:27,782 --> 00:38:29,992
No, no, no.

684
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,994
No,no,no.

685
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:34,205
No, no, no!

686
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:45,424
You have powers!

687
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:47,134
Yeah, baby,

688
00:38:47,218 --> 00:38:49,178
and there's not
a scratch on you!

689
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:50,846
Did you go through
the locked door?

690
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,015
Are those your powers?

691
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:55,393
Who can multiply like rabbits

692
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:57,561
and go right through
any solid...

693
00:38:58,437 --> 00:38:59,647
{SNEEZES)
{YELPS)

694
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,777
Oh, my God!

695
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:11,450
Hello?
Hey, honey.

696
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,369
You weren't gonna call me?
Oh, hey!

697
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:15,579
No. I mean, yes, yeah...

698
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:17,957
I just didn't wanna wake you.

699
00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:20,835
The strangest thing
just happened out in the yard.

700
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:22,128
Sounds like Ijust
woke you up.

701
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:23,212
No, no.

702
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,089
It's just, Jack-Jack...
He had an accident!

703
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:26,465
I knew it!

704
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:28,050
I'm coming home right now!
I never should have...

705
00:39:28,217 --> 00:39:30,636
No accident. Stay there
and finish your mission.

706
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:32,138
You never should...

707
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:34,265
What?
You don't think I can do this?

708
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:36,809
No, no.
Sorry. I misspoke.

709
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:38,227
Do you need me to come back?

710
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:41,188
No, no. No, I've got this.
Everything's great.

711
00:39:41,355 --> 00:39:42,731
What happened with Jack-Jack?

712
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,444
Nothing.
He's in excellent health.

713
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,654
Well, that's good.

714
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:50,781
How was Violet's date?
Uh...

715
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,741
HELEN“.
That was tonight, right?

716
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:55,411
Yes. Good.

717
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:57,663
All fine and good.

718
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,582
And Jack-Jack went down
with no trouble?

719
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,250
Fine, yes, no trouble.

720
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,002
And Dash got his
homework done?

721
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:04,420
All done.

722
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:05,588
So, things haven't
spiraled out

723
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:06,714
of control the moment I left?

724
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:08,716
Amazing as it may seem,

725
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:11,135
it has been
quite uneventful in fact.

726
00:40:11,302 --> 00:40:12,803
How about you?

727
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,598
I saved a runaway train!

728
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:18,809
It was so great!

729
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:20,769
The mayor was there to cut
the ribbon on this new train.

730
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:23,253
Elastigirl pursued the train

731
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:25,422
and was able
to successfully activate...

732
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,632
Blah, blah, blah. He says a
few words, cuts the ribbon...

733
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:28,925
and the train starts pulling

734
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,427
out of the station
backwards...

735
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,304
...track of its
brand new hovertrain...

736
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:33,847
...malfunctioned...

737
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,098
...thanking Elastigirl...

738
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:37,726
Superhero Elastigirl...

739
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:38,852
Elastigirl...

740
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,314
Boom! No casualties!

741
00:40:42,745 --> 00:40:43,829
. . . specialized motorbike,

742
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:45,080
saving all of the
passengers...

743
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:46,332
One thing leads to another

744
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:47,416
and suddenly, I go after it!

745
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,752
I'm telling you, honey,
it was a saga!

746
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:51,712
That's fantastic, honey!

747
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:54,006
And on your first night!

748
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:57,051
I am so proud of you, really.

749
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:58,719
I'm proud of you, honey.

750
00:40:58,886 --> 00:41:01,388
I know you want to get out
there and you will soon.

751
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:03,349
And you'll be amazing.

752
00:41:03,515 --> 00:41:04,642
I couldn't have done this

753
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:06,060
if you hadn't
taken over so well.

754
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:07,853
Thanks for handling
everything.

755
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,480
It's nothing.

756
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:12,650
I love you, honey.
I'll be back soon.

757
00:41:12,816 --> 00:41:15,527
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams, honey.

758
00:41:32,002 --> 00:41:34,755
Hey, Dad, it's okay.

759
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:36,632
I'll just wait for Mom
to get home.

760
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:40,219
As if she could...
I know how to...

761
00:41:41,136 --> 00:41:42,513
I can do math.

762
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:54,817
Oh, brother...

763
00:41:57,486 --> 00:41:59,113
Wait for Mom!

764
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,825
What am I,
a substitute parent?

765
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:07,413
It's not my fault
they changed math.

766
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,574
Come on, buddy. Come on.

767
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:21,285
I think I understand
your math assignment.

768
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:24,997
We still have some time
to finish it before your test.

769
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:26,833
So first, you wanna put
all the numbers

770
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:28,884
by themselves on one side.

771
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,928
...you change the sign.

772
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:33,722
That means a plus becomes
a minus and a minus...

773
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:35,182
You got it?

774
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:36,725
Yeah, baby!

775
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,533
Oh. Uh, hello.

776
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:54,702
We're in a new house.

777
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:57,871
I did write my address
on your locker...

778
00:42:58,038 --> 00:42:59,915
in permanent ink.

779
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:02,084
Oh, is that what that is?

780
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:03,586
Did you forget?

781
00:43:03,752 --> 00:43:05,796
Forget what?

782
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:08,757
That's funny.

783
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:13,220
Points for funny.

784
00:43:14,638 --> 00:43:16,765
Oh, was it the weird outfit?

785
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:19,059
Because there's a reason.

786
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:21,312
I'm in a drama class...

787
00:43:21,478 --> 00:43:23,606
and they just wanna do
Shakespeare...

788
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:25,566
but they're like, Try to make
it relevant for the kids.

789
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:27,818
So, like, Oh, superheroes!
Kids love superheroes.

790
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:28,902
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

791
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:30,112
You wanna wear
one kind of tights...

792
00:43:30,195 --> 00:43:31,196
and then they're like,

793
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,740
No, wear these other
kind of tights.

794
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:33,907
Do I know you?

795
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,002
Many say
your speech today is critical.

796
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:47,630
Both sides just want the best
for their people.

797
00:43:47,796 --> 00:43:51,383
We are so close to finally
getting peace in the region.

798
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:53,260
I haven't done this
in a while.

799
00:43:53,427 --> 00:43:55,763
This is good.
The train gives us momentum.

800
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:57,848
Just go out there
and be your charming self...

801
00:43:58,015 --> 00:43:59,266
and capitalize on it.

802
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:01,769
Ms. Elastigirl,
they're ready for you.

803
00:44:01,935 --> 00:44:03,562
Hey, stretch a leg.

804
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:06,899
Thank you, Chad. It was fun.

805
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:09,443
Ambassador, your documents.
We're moving to the rooftop.

806
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:12,571
Oh, Madame Ambassador, hello!

807
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:14,114
Oh, you are EIastigirl!

808
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:16,367
This is why now
I'm shaking your hand.

809
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,577
It was so sad
when you went underground.

810
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:22,539
I am glad to see
you back in your shiny outfit.

811
00:44:22,706 --> 00:44:24,041
That means so much
coming from you.

812
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:25,125
Good luck with your speech.

813
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:26,710
This way, Ambassador.

814
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:28,003
Bring lasting peace!

815
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,922
I will, when you defeat evil.

816
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:31,965
Okay.

817
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,828
Three, two...

818
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:36,122
For over 15 years,

819
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,415
superheroes have been
in hiding.

820
00:44:37,582 --> 00:44:39,459
Forced into it by a society

821
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:40,960
no longer willing
to support them.

822
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:42,462
That may soon be changing...

823
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:45,089
due to a growing movement
to bring the Supers back.

824
00:44:45,256 --> 00:44:47,175
Here, fresh on the heels
of her own

825
00:44:47,258 --> 00:44:48,968
heroic save
of a runaway train...

826
00:44:49,135 --> 00:44:51,471
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elastigirl.

827
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:53,692
Welcome!
Hello, Chad.

828
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:56,028
All the polls are going
in your direction.

829
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:57,363
That's true.
Things are good...

830
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:58,656
Hello.

831
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:00,783
Uh, hello?

832
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,660
Do I have your attention?

833
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:04,244
Yes, Chad.

834
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,537
Of course I do.

835
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,456
I'm appearing on your screen.

836
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:10,542
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

837
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,378
Screens are everywhere.

838
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,880
We are controlled by screens.

839
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:19,969
And screens
are controlled by me...

840
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:21,971
Screenslaver.

841
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,055
Hey!

842
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:25,432
I control this broadcast...

843
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,060
and this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.

844
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:29,228
What's wrong with him?

845
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:30,646
The signal's been hijacked.
I'll check it out.

846
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:32,314
Don't look at any monitors.

847
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:34,733
I could hijack
the ambassador's aerocade...

848
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,944
while it's still airborne.

849
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,821
Right, Elastigirl?

850
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:43,325
Nearest window!
Where's the nearest window?

851
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,673
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Elastigirl?

852
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,216
Which one?

853
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:09,935
EIastigirl!
What are you doing here?

854
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:12,187
The ambassador is in danger.
Which chopper is she...

855
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:13,647
Look out!

856
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:17,359
Follow them and get me close!

857
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,823
Get out of the sky,
and touch down safely!

858
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:34,585
Stand down! It's Elastigirl.

859
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:36,962
Stay in your seat, ma'am!

860
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,912
We're under attack!

861
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:48,790
Quick, go!
Protect the ambassador!

862
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,377
Open the door!

863
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:54,587
Do as she says!

864
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:57,882
Can you all swim?

865
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,258
Yeah.
No!

866
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:23,310
We're gonna have
to slingshot! Hang on!

867
00:47:30,985 --> 00:47:33,112
Are you all right, ma'am?

868
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:34,947
I'm perfectly fine...

869
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:38,659
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Oh!

870
00:47:44,915 --> 00:47:47,418
Boys are jerks
and superheroes suck.

871
00:47:47,626 --> 00:47:48,627
Good morning!

872
00:47:48,794 --> 00:47:50,755
He takes one look
at me in that suit...

873
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:54,592
and decides to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

874
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:56,761
He's protecting himself.

875
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,555
If he really did see you,
it's best that he forget.

876
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:01,474
It's better for you, too.

877
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,684
I can't tell you
how many memories

878
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:06,020
Dicker's had to erase
over the years...

879
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:07,855
when someone figured out

880
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:09,565
your mother's or my identity.

881
00:48:09,648 --> 00:48:12,068
It was Dicker!

882
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:14,445
You told him about Tony!
Honey...

883
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:17,156
You had me erased
from Tony's mind!

884
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:32,338
I hate superheroes!

885
00:48:32,505 --> 00:48:34,381
And I renounce them!

886
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:42,515
I renounce them!

887
00:48:51,357 --> 00:48:54,193
Is she having adolescence?

888
00:48:54,717 --> 00:48:55,884
A new report
out today shows that,

889
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:57,803
when it comes
to decision-making...

890
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,638
people have more trust
in a monkey

891
00:48:59,722 --> 00:49:01,098
throwing darts than Congress.

892
00:49:01,265 --> 00:49:03,392
What's going on, Tommy?
A protest?

893
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:05,269
They're here in support.

894
00:49:05,436 --> 00:49:07,479
Support? Support of what?

895
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:09,815
Well, in support of you.

896
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:15,279
Wow. Oh, hey...

897
00:49:15,446 --> 00:49:17,531
Thanks for coming out. Hi.

898
00:49:18,157 --> 00:49:20,367
Oh, my goodness.
Thanks so much.

899
00:49:20,784 --> 00:49:21,827
Oh, hello.

900
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:23,328
What does your sign say?

901
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,293
Ka-boom! Ka-pow!

902
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:31,170
Supers should be legal now!

903
00:49:32,004 --> 00:49:34,047
Talk to ya.
Oh, what do ya know!

904
00:49:34,214 --> 00:49:35,466
EIIenwood.

905
00:49:35,632 --> 00:49:37,342
Oh, now you wanna
return my calls

906
00:49:37,426 --> 00:49:38,427
about superheroes, huh?

907
00:49:38,594 --> 00:49:40,387
Oh. I'll have to
call you back.

908
00:49:40,554 --> 00:49:41,555
Oh, that felt good.

909
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:43,015
Felicia, hold my calls,
please.

910
00:49:43,182 --> 00:49:44,683
Hey!
It's working!

911
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,977
Hey, the ambassador
made a big speech

912
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,187
about superheroes today.

913
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:49,646
Turns out
saving someone's life

914
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,440
makes a good impression
on them. Who knew, huh?

915
00:49:51,607 --> 00:49:53,650
I'm getting calls
from all over the world.

916
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:56,236
Media awareness is up 72%.

917
00:49:56,669 --> 00:49:58,546
The push
for superhero legalization

918
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:00,422
is becoming
a worldwide movement!

919
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:02,299
I have big plans
for our next move.

920
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,093
We're gonna have
a summit at sea.

921
00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:05,177
We'll use our ship...

922
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:07,555
we'll gather leaders
and Supers...

923
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:09,890
-from all over the world.
That's great.

924
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,350
I'm happy.

925
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:12,852
I'm happy the numbers are up.

926
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:15,980
I'm happy the ambassador
is pro-superhero...

927
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,857
and I'm happy you're happy.

928
00:50:18,023 --> 00:50:20,985
I'm hearing that you're happy,
but why am I not feeling it?

929
00:50:21,405 --> 00:50:22,698
Because I didn't get him!

930
00:50:22,782 --> 00:50:23,866
Screenslaver
is still out there.

931
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:26,994
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

932
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:28,246
He's gonna want more

933
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:30,498
and as long as
he gets to play, he wins.

934
00:50:30,665 --> 00:50:32,333
One thing
I've learned in business?

935
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,210
Smell the flowers.

936
00:50:34,377 --> 00:50:35,753
They don't bloom that often.

937
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,338
What do you want
on your tombstone?

938
00:50:37,421 --> 00:50:38,422
She worried a lot?

939
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:39,924
All right,
stop talking.

940
00:50:40,642 --> 00:50:41,684
Show her.

941
00:50:47,065 --> 00:50:49,943
This is just
so exciting, isn't it? Huh?

942
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,863
Oh, wow. Uh...

943
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:57,075
Wow! Elastigirl,
there you are.

944
00:50:57,242 --> 00:50:58,535
Hello.
I didn't...

945
00:50:58,701 --> 00:50:59,786
Wow!

946
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:01,913
Come on,
get yourself together, Karen.

947
00:51:02,622 --> 00:51:05,625
Hi, my superhero name is Voyd.

948
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:09,462
I just wanna thank you,
for, like, for being you!

949
00:51:11,714 --> 00:51:14,801
Okay, what I can do, um,
is this.

950
00:51:20,223 --> 00:51:22,183
Yeah.

951
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,812
That is impressive.
Very interdimensional.

952
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:28,106
I felt like an outcast before.

953
00:51:28,273 --> 00:51:32,318
But now, with you being you,
I feel like...

954
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:35,280
Yay, me.

955
00:51:36,614 --> 00:51:38,408
I flew them in from all over.

956
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,201
They've all been in hiding.

957
00:51:40,368 --> 00:51:42,495
They have powers,
secret identities...

958
00:51:42,662 --> 00:51:44,622
and names
they've given themselves.

959
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:47,500
I'm Screech. It's a pleasure.

960
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:48,918
I've always considered you

961
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:50,962
the gold standard
for superheroes.

962
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:53,131
Well, thanks. You're too nice.

963
00:51:53,298 --> 00:51:55,008
I am called Brick.

964
00:51:55,175 --> 00:51:58,344
Nice to meet you, Brick.
Uh, where are you from?

965
00:51:58,511 --> 00:51:59,846
Wisconsin.

966
00:52:00,013 --> 00:52:03,099
Oh. Elastigirl.
I assume your powers are...

967
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:05,518
You know,
zapping things electrically...

968
00:52:05,685 --> 00:52:07,812
charging things, bolts of
lightning, that kind of stuff.

969
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:09,189
Name's Reflux.

970
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:12,567
Medical condition
or superpower, you decide.

971
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,985
That's a little line

972
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:15,320
I say just to put
people at ease.

973
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,529
Hope I don't offend.

974
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:18,573
Oh, no, no, no.
Reflux. Love it.

975
00:52:19,908 --> 00:52:22,577
Well, I do look forward
to working with you.

976
00:52:22,994 --> 00:52:25,997
Yes, that is impressive.
Keep practicing.

977
00:52:27,665 --> 00:52:28,875
OW!

978
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:35,381
Well, I'm beat.
Congratulations. Big day.

979
00:52:35,548 --> 00:52:37,717
Good night, ladies.
I will see you tomorrow.

980
00:52:37,884 --> 00:52:38,885
Good night.

981
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:40,803
Must be nice for you,

982
00:52:40,887 --> 00:52:42,388
being out front
after all this time.

983
00:52:42,555 --> 00:52:43,598
Out front?

984
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:46,601
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days...

985
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,645
and even then,
you were kind of

986
00:52:48,728 --> 00:52:49,938
in Mr. Incredible's shadow.

987
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:51,606
Nah, I beg to differ.

988
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:53,608
I'm not... I'm not
saying you weren't big.

989
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:55,652
No, you were,
and are, a superstar...

990
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:58,530
but you have
the stage to yourself now.

991
00:52:58,696 --> 00:53:00,573
And people have
to pay attention.

992
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,283
Oh, you mean, It's a man's
world and all that?

993
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:04,160
Well, what world
do you live in?

994
00:53:04,244 --> 00:53:05,578
Your brother runs DEVTECH.

995
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:09,791
I don't want his job.
I invent, he sells.

996
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,127
I ask you, which of us
has the greater influence?

997
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:14,712
Which side of me
are you asking?

998
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:16,047
The believer or the cynic?

999
00:53:16,214 --> 00:53:17,215
The cynic...

1000
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,883
Would say selling
is more important

1001
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:21,094
because the best sellers
have the most buyers.

1002
00:53:21,261 --> 00:53:22,845
Doesn't matter
what you're selling.

1003
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:24,681
It only matters
what people buy.

1004
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:25,890
This is true.

1005
00:53:26,057 --> 00:53:28,393
If I discovered
the origin of the universe...

1006
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,936
my brother would find a way

1007
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:32,855
to market it as a, uh,
foot massager.

1008
00:53:35,483 --> 00:53:37,151
So, what would
the believer say?

1009
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:39,696
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

1010
00:53:39,862 --> 00:53:41,948
Don't wait for permission,
assert yourself

1011
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:43,616
and impose your will
on the status quo.

1012
00:53:43,783 --> 00:53:45,410
Sounds like my brother.
What?

1013
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:46,661
You sound like my brother.

1014
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:47,870
Well, he's not wrong.

1015
00:53:47,954 --> 00:53:49,581
There is an art
to getting a reaction...

1016
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,040
Oh! I know
how to get him.

1017
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:54,127
My brother?
No. Screenslaver!

1018
00:53:54,294 --> 00:53:56,796
You're tech-savvy. I need
to lock onto a signal...

1019
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:58,047
and trace its origin.

1020
00:53:58,214 --> 00:53:59,299
How fast can you
slap something together

1021
00:53:59,382 --> 00:54:00,425
and meet me at the airport?

1022
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:01,509
Airport?

1023
00:54:01,593 --> 00:54:02,885
Need to go
out of town, pronto.

1024
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:04,512
I can get your contraption
together by 5:00 am.

1025
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,556
I need to get on TV.
Chad!

1026
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:08,391
I'll get my brother to set up
an exclusive with him

1027
00:54:08,474 --> 00:54:09,475
tonight on the newscast.

1028
00:54:09,642 --> 00:54:10,685
Finish our interview by phone!

1029
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:11,769
Promote the hell out of it.

1030
00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:13,479
Independence
from Screenslavery!

1031
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:15,857
Chad tonight.
Boom!

1032
00:54:19,652 --> 00:54:20,987
Dicker.
Yeah, hey, Rick.

1033
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:22,739
You remember that kid
I mentioned to you?

1034
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:23,823
Tony Rydinger.

1035
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,700
Mind wipe? Yeah, nice kid.

1036
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,535
Well, you also wiped out

1037
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:29,454
the Friday night date
my daughter had with him.

1038
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:31,873
In fact,
you wiped out my daughter.

1039
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,292
Oops.
Not an exact science, Bob.

1040
00:54:34,459 --> 00:54:36,085
Rick, you gotta help me here.

1041
00:54:36,252 --> 00:54:39,172
Violet hates me, and you,
and superheroes.

1042
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:41,758
I gotta fix this.
What do you know about Tony?

1043
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:43,092
Um...

1044
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:44,469
Not much.

1045
00:54:44,636 --> 00:54:45,928
Seems like a good kid.

1046
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,410
Popular, plays sports, music.

1047
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,997
Parents own The Happy Platter,
kid works there part time.

1048
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,332
Happy Platter?

1049
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,588
Why did we drive
all the way across town

1050
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,465
for The Happy Platter?

1051
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,885
We'd like a booth over there,
near the philodendron.

1052
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,970
Good, right?
Near the philodendron.

1053
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:12,521
This platter doesn't look
all that happy to me.

1054
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,565
It looks bored.

1055
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:16,608
Ha-ha! The Bored Platter!

1056
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:18,986
I thought Vi would want
a change of pace

1057
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:20,153
from drive-in food.

1058
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,030
I like drive-in food.

1059
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:23,949
Does this mean vegetables?

1060
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:25,951
A balanced diet
means vegetables, kiddo.

1061
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:27,494
Get used to it.

1062
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:29,580
Good evening, everyone.

1063
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,124
Oh, no!

1064
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,500
Is she all right?
Violet, are you okay?

1065
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:34,710
Nothing to see here.

1066
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:35,794
Yeah, more napkins
would be good.

1067
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:37,421
I'm fine, I'm fine.
It happens all the time here.

1068
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:38,672
Mops it right up.

1069
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,341
Normally, she doesn't
ever drip like this.

1070
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:43,635
Would you like water, sir?
Yes.

1071
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:46,555
Yes, I would.
This is my daughter...

1072
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,098
-who you must know, right?
God. Stop.

1073
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:49,391
Hello.
Violet.

1074
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:50,726
Hello, Violet.

1075
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,270
Hey, Vi, say hi to...

1076
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:54,813
Don't push it, Dad.

1077
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,607
I'm Dash, her little brother.

1078
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:57,774
Hello.

1079
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,360
Mmm. This is
really good water.

1080
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:01,486
It's very refreshing.

1081
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:02,779
Spring water, is it?

1082
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:05,365
I don't know, sir.
I think it's tap.

1083
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:06,992
Well, it is very good.

1084
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,368
Excellent tap.

1085
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:09,953
Excuse me.

1086
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:12,581
Well, nice to meet you.

1087
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:14,166
Where'd she go?
Mmm.

1088
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:16,335
To find a good place
to be angry?

1089
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:20,172
Tonight, we go now to
a special remote interview...

1090
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:21,381
with Elastigirl.

1091
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:22,633
How you feeling, Chad?

1092
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:23,717
You doing all right?

1093
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,178
I'm fine.
The doctors checked me out.

1094
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:28,263
I have no memory
of the event.

1095
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:30,098
I gotta tell you,
it's pretty strange

1096
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,183
to see a recording...

1097
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:34,102
of yourself the night before
and have no recollection.

1098
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:35,979
I don't think
anyone needs to worry.

1099
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:38,159
We've taken many precautions
tonight though.

1100
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:39,618
Where are you right now?

1101
00:56:39,785 --> 00:56:42,746
On a case, in a secure
undisclosed location.

1102
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:44,248
I wanna talk
about you...

1103
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:46,876
starting with your save
of a runaway train.

1104
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:49,128
Here's an exclusive
unedited clip

1105
00:56:49,378 --> 00:56:50,629
from your own suit cam.

1106
00:56:50,796 --> 00:56:52,006
Roll the clip.

1107
00:56:52,381 --> 00:56:53,674
This thing's
really moving.

1108
00:56:54,842 --> 00:56:57,303
100 and climbing.
How much track is built?

1109
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,971
EVELYN“. About 25 miles.

1110
00:57:00,598 --> 00:57:03,517
The Screenslaver
interrupts this program...

1111
00:57:03,684 --> 00:57:04,935
for an important announcement.

1112
00:57:05,102 --> 00:57:06,937
I'll be damned. She knew.

1113
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:08,522
Let's see
if your gadget works.

1114
00:57:08,917 --> 00:57:10,836
Don't bother
watching the rest.

1115
00:57:10,919 --> 00:57:11,920
Gotcha!

1116
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:14,339
Elastigirl doesn't
save the day.

1117
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,467
She only postpones her defeat.

1118
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,803
And while she postpones
her defeat...

1119
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,805
you eat chips

1120
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,365
and watch her confront problems...

1121
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:25,701
that you are too lazy
to deal with.

1122
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:28,537
Superheroes are part
of your brainless desire...

1123
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:31,248
to replace true experience
with simulation.

1124
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:35,085
You don't talk,
you watch talk shows.

1125
00:57:35,544 --> 00:57:38,464
You don't play games,
you watch game shows.

1126
00:57:38,964 --> 00:57:41,467
Travel, relationships, risk...

1127
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:45,054
every meaningful experience
must be packaged...

1128
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:48,015
and delivered to you
to watch at a distance.

1129
00:57:48,557 --> 00:57:50,768
So that you can remain
ever sheltered...

1130
00:57:51,158 --> 00:57:52,159
ever passive...

1131
00:57:52,827 --> 00:57:55,287
ever ravenous consumers...

1132
00:57:55,454 --> 00:57:57,957
who can't bring themselves
to rise from their couches...

1133
00:57:58,457 --> 00:58:01,794
break a sweat
and participate in life.

1134
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,630
You want superheroes
to protect you...

1135
00:58:05,464 --> 00:58:09,343
and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process.

1136
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:12,263
While you tell yourselves
you're being looked after.

1137
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,057
That your interests
are being served.

1138
00:58:15,432 --> 00:58:18,018
And your rights
are being upheld.

1139
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:21,021
So that the system can
keep stealing from you...

1140
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:24,024
smiling at you all the while.

1141
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:27,486
Go ahead,
send your Supers to stop me.

1142
00:58:27,894 --> 00:58:29,980
Grab your snacks,
watch your screens,

1143
00:58:30,063 --> 00:58:32,065
and see what happens.

1144
00:58:32,232 --> 00:58:35,110
You are no longer in control.

1145
00:58:35,277 --> 00:58:36,653
I am.

1146
01:00:18,466 --> 01:00:20,051
Find anything?

1147
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:12,061
Sorry!

1148
01:01:44,385 --> 01:01:45,594
What happened?

1149
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:48,431
What happened is
you destroyed my evidence.

1150
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:50,433
What's going on?
What did I do?

1151
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:52,184
What did you guys do to me?

1152
01:01:52,351 --> 01:01:54,770
That's right, punk.
Blame the system.

1153
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,648
Your tracker worked
like a charm, Evelyn.

1154
01:01:57,815 --> 01:01:58,816
You're a genius.

1155
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:00,067
Aw, shucks!

1156
01:02:00,234 --> 01:02:02,445
I'm just the genius
behind the genius.

1157
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:05,197
Hey, Dad.

1158
01:02:05,364 --> 01:02:08,951
We're doing fractions
and denismals and percentages

1159
01:02:09,118 --> 01:02:10,119
and I don't get 'em.

1160
01:02:10,202 --> 01:02:11,328
Aren't you...

1161
01:02:11,412 --> 01:02:12,663
Didn't we get all caught up?

1162
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,165
Yeah, we were caught up...

1163
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:17,501
and now we're doing fractions
and percentages and demicels.

1164
01:02:17,585 --> 01:02:18,586
Decimals.

1165
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:19,670
...the
addition of the Incredibile,

1166
01:02:19,754 --> 01:02:20,755
the super car...

1167
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,240
once driven by superhero,
Mr. Incredible.

1168
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,201
It's the kind of thing you buy
when you have everything else.

1169
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,704
They said it was
beyond repair.

1170
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:30,955
Hey,
it was in perfect condition.

1171
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,665
You used to drive that?

1172
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,459
They said it was destroyed.

1173
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,336
Long thought lost
or destroyed,

1174
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,171
the famous car
turned up at private auction.

1175
01:02:38,594 --> 01:02:39,720
They said it was...

1176
01:02:39,887 --> 01:02:41,305
That's my car!

1177
01:02:49,772 --> 01:02:52,316
Stupid water feature!

1178
01:02:52,483 --> 01:02:55,027
This car is just loaded
with amazing gadgets.

1179
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,111
Care to demonstrate?

1180
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:58,322
I'd love to,
but we haven't figured out

1181
01:02:58,405 --> 01:02:59,573
how to make them work yet.

1182
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:04,829
Wow! It works?

1183
01:03:06,163 --> 01:03:07,206
Huh?

1184
01:03:07,706 --> 01:03:09,917
What are you doing?
This is not a toy!

1185
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,168
That's a rocket launcher!

1186
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:13,212
Sweet! Which one launches
the rocket?

1187
01:03:13,379 --> 01:03:14,839
Hey!
This is not your car!

1188
01:03:15,005 --> 01:03:16,340
It's not your car, either!

1189
01:03:16,507 --> 01:03:18,008
It is so!
It's the Incredibile.

1190
01:03:18,175 --> 01:03:20,094
Why's that guy have it?
He shouldn't!

1191
01:03:20,261 --> 01:03:21,804
Launch the rockets!
Launch the rockets!

1192
01:03:21,887 --> 01:03:22,930
Launch the rockets!

1193
01:03:23,097 --> 01:03:24,640
I'm not launching anything!
I wanna blow it up!

1194
01:03:24,723 --> 01:03:25,850
Do you think I want
an angry rich guy...

1195
01:03:26,016 --> 01:03:27,601
coming after me right now...

1196
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:29,228
when I'm trying not to...
I'm not sure

1197
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:30,396
What's happened here, Mark.
-...distract your mother.

1198
01:03:30,479 --> 01:03:31,897
But everyone here
has scattered

1199
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:33,774
and I'm afraid I'll need
to move at any minute.

1200
01:03:33,858 --> 01:03:36,443
Rich guy got my car.

1201
01:03:38,487 --> 01:03:41,031
So, you're not gonna
steal your car

1202
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:42,491
back from the rich guy?

1203
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:45,494
{SNEEZES)

1204
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:53,043
What the heck is that?

1205
01:03:56,964 --> 01:03:58,883
Jack-Jack has powers?

1206
01:03:59,049 --> 01:04:00,050
Well, yeah, but...

1207
01:04:00,217 --> 01:04:01,594
You knew about this?
Yeah.

1208
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,345
Why didn't you tell us?
I don't know.

1209
01:04:03,512 --> 01:04:05,764
We're your kids.
We need to know these things.

1210
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:07,141
Did you tell Mom?
No.

1211
01:04:07,308 --> 01:04:09,059
Why not?
Your mother is not...

1212
01:04:09,226 --> 01:04:10,227
You'd want us to tell you,
wouldn't you?

1213
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:12,187
Why would you not tell Mom?
Because I didn't wanna...

1214
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:13,272
What?

1215
01:04:13,355 --> 01:04:14,607
Come on, man.
Because it's not the time.

1216
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,691
Why?
Because...

1217
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:16,901
So uncool!

1218
01:04:16,984 --> 01:04:18,277
Because I'm formulating, okay?

1219
01:04:19,194 --> 01:04:21,906
I'm taking in information,
I'm processing!

1220
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:23,991
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend...

1221
01:04:24,158 --> 01:04:25,159
and keeping the baby

1222
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:26,493
from turning into
a flaming monster!

1223
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,745
How do I do it?

1224
01:04:28,954 --> 01:04:31,040
By rolling with
the punches, baby!

1225
01:04:31,206 --> 01:04:33,626
I eat thunder
and crap lightning, okay?

1226
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:35,502
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible!

1227
01:04:35,669 --> 01:04:38,797
Not Mr. So-So
or Mr. Mediocre-Guy.

1228
01:04:38,964 --> 01:04:41,508
Mr. Incredible!

1229
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,803
We should call Lucius.

1230
01:04:45,387 --> 01:04:46,972
No. I can handle it.

1231
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:48,974
There's no way I'm gonna...

1232
01:04:58,525 --> 01:05:00,152
Dada.

1233
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:02,821
I'm calling Lucius.

1234
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,161
Looks normal to me.
When did this start happening?

1235
01:05:09,328 --> 01:05:11,205
Since Helen got the job.

1236
01:05:11,372 --> 01:05:13,082
I assume she knows?
Are you kidding?

1237
01:05:13,248 --> 01:05:14,667
I can't tell her about this,

1238
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,834
not while she's doing
hero work!

1239
01:05:16,001 --> 01:05:17,002
Mama!

1240
01:05:17,086 --> 01:05:18,087
Girls, come on.

1241
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:19,421
Leave the saving the world
to the men?

1242
01:05:19,588 --> 01:05:20,839
I don 't think so.
Mama!

1243
01:05:21,632 --> 01:05:23,258
I've got to succeed!

1244
01:05:23,425 --> 01:05:25,052
So she can succeed.

1245
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:27,805
So we can succeed!
I get it, Bob!

1246
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:30,474
I get it. When was
the last time you slept?

1247
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:32,226
Who keeps track of that?

1248
01:05:32,393 --> 01:05:33,894
Besides, he's a baby.

1249
01:05:33,978 --> 01:05:36,146
I can handle it,
I got this handled.

1250
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:38,273
So, you good then?

1251
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,734
You got everything
under control? Right?

1252
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,571
What the...?

1253
01:05:45,948 --> 01:05:48,033
Cookie! Cha Cha want a cookie?

1254
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,911
Num-num coome'?
Cha Cha wanna mum-mum?

1255
01:05:51,078 --> 01:05:53,706
Num-num cookie! Cookie!

1256
01:05:53,872 --> 01:05:54,957
You're not...
Cookie!

1257
01:05:55,124 --> 01:05:56,458
Oh, my God!
Cookie!

1258
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,210
Dada! Dada. Dada.
Whoa.

1259
01:05:58,377 --> 01:06:00,045
Okay! Okay.

1260
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:02,089
So, he can still
hear you from the...

1261
01:06:02,256 --> 01:06:04,133
From the other dimension,
yeah.

1262
01:06:04,299 --> 01:06:06,301
That is freaky.
I mean, that's not like...

1263
01:06:06,468 --> 01:06:09,346
Not like our other kids.
No, it is not.

1264
01:06:09,513 --> 01:06:11,974
Full powers, totally random.

1265
01:06:12,057 --> 01:06:14,393
So now, he's what? Is he good?

1266
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,603
Yeah, you'd think so, right?

1267
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:19,314
Obviously, I can't keep
giving him cookies!

1268
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:21,567
Uh-uh?
But if I stop...

1269
01:06:25,237 --> 01:06:27,072
Ahhh! He is freaking!
Again, he is freaking!

1270
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:28,615
No biting the daddy!

1271
01:06:28,782 --> 01:06:29,783
What the...?
No biting!

1272
01:06:35,664 --> 01:06:37,791
Okay.

1273
01:06:39,668 --> 01:06:42,379
I think I just need
a little bit of me time.

1274
01:06:42,546 --> 01:06:43,922
Then I'll be good to go.

1275
01:06:44,089 --> 01:06:46,175
Oh, you need
more than me time, Bob.

1276
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:48,093
You need
major life realignment

1277
01:06:48,177 --> 01:06:49,344
on a number of levels.

1278
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:52,014
Starting with
baby superfreak here!

1279
01:06:52,181 --> 01:06:55,768
You need some solid
outside-the-box thinking.

1280
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,028
Galbaki?

1281
01:07:06,195 --> 01:07:10,157
Elastigirl's supersuit
is by Galbaki?

1282
01:07:10,324 --> 01:07:11,700
Explain yourself!

1283
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,581
Oh, my God.
You're worse than I thought.

1284
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:20,584
It's the baby.
I brought the baby.

1285
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:24,421
Oh, highly unusual.

1286
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:33,430
You look ghastly, Robert.

1287
01:07:33,597 --> 01:07:35,390
I haven't been sleeping.

1288
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:39,478
I broke my daughter,
they keep changing math...

1289
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:42,606
we needed double-A batteries,
but I got triple-A's...

1290
01:07:42,773 --> 01:07:45,484
and now we still need
double-A batteries.

1291
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:47,820
I put one red thing
in a load of whites

1292
01:07:47,903 --> 01:07:49,863
and now everything's pink.

1293
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,240
And I think we need eggs.

1294
01:07:51,406 --> 01:07:54,952
Done properly,
parenting is a heroic act.

1295
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:56,703
Done properly.

1296
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:59,748
I am fortunate that it has
never afflicted me.

1297
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:01,625
But you do not come to me

1298
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:03,961
for eggs and batteries,
Robert.

1299
01:08:04,128 --> 01:08:05,671
I design herowear

1300
01:08:05,754 --> 01:08:08,132
and Elastigirl
must have a new suit.

1301
01:08:08,215 --> 01:08:10,342
Actually,
it's Jack-Jack.

1302
01:08:10,926 --> 01:08:13,720
You also wish
a new suit for the baby?

1303
01:08:13,887 --> 01:08:17,057
I would hardly classify
this as an emergency.

1304
01:08:17,975 --> 01:08:20,435
Well, he's a special case.
Worth studying.

1305
01:08:20,602 --> 01:08:22,354
If I could just leave him
with you for a while...

1306
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:24,273
Leave him? Here?

1307
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:27,693
I am not a baby person,
Robert.

1308
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:30,654
I have no baby facilities.
I am an artist.

1309
01:08:30,821 --> 01:08:33,657
I do not involve myself in
the prosaic day-to-day to...

1310
01:08:34,616 --> 01:08:35,826
day.

1311
01:08:39,288 --> 01:08:40,998
Fascinating!

1312
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,502
Are you seeing this, Robert?

1313
01:08:47,296 --> 01:08:48,505
Dada.

1314
01:08:57,639 --> 01:09:00,267
Oh, my God.

1315
01:09:01,185 --> 01:09:02,227
Yes!

1316
01:09:02,936 --> 01:09:04,521
Of course you can leave
the baby overnight.

1317
01:09:04,688 --> 01:09:06,190
I'm sure filling in for Helen
is challenging,

1318
01:09:06,273 --> 01:09:07,274
and you are very tired...

1319
01:09:07,441 --> 01:09:08,567
and the other children
need you

1320
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:09,693
and miss you,
and you must go to them.

1321
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,445
Auntie Edna will take care
of everything...

1322
01:09:11,612 --> 01:09:14,406
so, drive safely and goodbye.
I enjoy our visits.

1323
01:09:17,117 --> 01:09:18,827
Auntie Edna?

1324
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:25,792
Attention. Attention.

1325
01:09:25,876 --> 01:09:28,170
I wanna thank everyone
that came out tonight...

1326
01:09:28,337 --> 01:09:29,838
in support of superheroes...

1327
01:09:30,005 --> 01:09:33,175
and bringing them
back into society!

1328
01:09:33,342 --> 01:09:34,885
You all made it happen.

1329
01:09:35,052 --> 01:09:36,345
The need for this
has been made

1330
01:09:36,428 --> 01:09:37,804
crystal clear
in recent days...

1331
01:09:37,971 --> 01:09:39,806
with bad actors
like the self-proclaimed

1332
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,725
Screenslaver
threatening our peace.

1333
01:09:41,892 --> 01:09:43,227
His reign was short, huh?

1334
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,520
And thanks to this woman...

1335
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:48,774
a great super.
You love her. You missed her.

1336
01:09:48,941 --> 01:09:51,860
Welcome back, Elastigirl.

1337
01:09:52,778 --> 01:09:55,322
Come on up here.
Don't be bashful.

1338
01:09:55,489 --> 01:09:57,074
Come on. Get up here.

1339
01:09:57,866 --> 01:10:00,369
I want you to have this.

1340
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:02,287
A memento.

1341
01:10:02,454 --> 01:10:05,624
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
and everyone at DEVTECH.

1342
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:07,584
I am forever in your debt.

1343
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:09,503
And thanks to all of you,

1344
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:12,339
your pressure
changed all the right minds.

1345
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:15,050
We've made amazing headway
in a very short time...

1346
01:10:15,217 --> 01:10:18,262
which leads me
to an important announcement.

1347
01:10:18,428 --> 01:10:20,555
Just now,
at a worldwide summit...

1348
01:10:20,722 --> 01:10:22,474
leaders from more than
a hundred

1349
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:24,059
of the world's
top countries...

1350
01:10:24,226 --> 01:10:27,688
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again!

1351
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:31,316
We'll gather superheroes
and leaders

1352
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,567
from all over the planet...

1353
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:34,278
on our boat, the Everjust...

1354
01:10:34,444 --> 01:10:37,823
for a televised
signing ceremony at sea.

1355
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:41,535
Now if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

1356
01:10:45,122 --> 01:10:46,999
So good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

1357
01:10:47,165 --> 01:10:49,334
Hey.
Hi, it's me, again.

1358
01:10:49,418 --> 01:10:52,212
Um, there's, uh, something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1359
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:54,965
Yeah, how do you balance
the superhero stuff

1360
01:10:55,048 --> 01:10:56,091
With the life stuff?

1361
01:10:56,967 --> 01:10:58,802
I know I can handle
the superhero stuff.

1362
01:11:01,888 --> 01:11:03,181
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh.

1363
01:11:03,265 --> 01:11:05,142
Would you please
excuse me a moment?

1364
01:11:05,225 --> 01:11:07,811
Oh. Yeah, okay, see you later!
Good talk!

1365
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,952
Hey, Vi.
Hey.

1366
01:11:33,036 --> 01:11:34,037
Where's Jack-Jack?

1367
01:11:34,204 --> 01:11:35,622
E's taking him
for a little bit.

1368
01:11:35,789 --> 01:11:38,250
Edna is babysitting?
Yeah.

1369
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:40,335
And you're okay with this?

1370
01:11:40,502 --> 01:11:42,963
Yeah. I don't know why,
but yeah.

1371
01:11:44,882 --> 01:11:47,342
I wanted to say
something to you.

1372
01:11:48,635 --> 01:11:50,637
Sorry about Tony.

1373
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:54,057
I didn't think about Dicker
erasing his memory...

1374
01:11:54,224 --> 01:11:57,060
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice...

1375
01:11:57,686 --> 01:12:00,814
you never made.
It's not fair, I know.

1376
01:12:01,607 --> 01:12:03,609
And then, I made it worse
at the restaurant

1377
01:12:03,692 --> 01:12:04,943
by trying to...

1378
01:12:05,193 --> 01:12:06,612
Anyway. Anyway...

1379
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:08,822
I'm sorry.

1380
01:12:08,989 --> 01:12:10,490
I'm used to knowing

1381
01:12:10,574 --> 01:12:12,242
what the right thing
to do is...

1382
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:15,495
but now, I'm not sure anymore.

1383
01:12:15,662 --> 01:12:17,581
I just wanna be...

1384
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:21,209
a good dad.

1385
01:12:25,213 --> 01:12:27,215
You're not good.

1386
01:12:29,343 --> 01:12:30,844
You're super.

1387
01:12:40,687 --> 01:12:43,482
Are superheroes allowed
to drink on duty?

1388
01:12:43,649 --> 01:12:46,693
I'm definitely not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

1389
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,904
I know I should be up there...

1390
01:12:49,071 --> 01:12:51,198
but I had to step away from
the grip and grins, you know?

1391
01:12:51,365 --> 01:12:54,284
Gotta get away
to keep it pure. I know I do.

1392
01:12:54,451 --> 01:12:56,078
What are you getting
away from?

1393
01:12:56,244 --> 01:12:59,373
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

1394
01:12:59,539 --> 01:13:01,458
But you love him,
you two are this company.

1395
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:02,584
Yin and yang.

1396
01:13:02,751 --> 01:13:05,170
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

1397
01:13:05,337 --> 01:13:09,466
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

1398
01:13:09,633 --> 01:13:11,301
I never know what people want.

1399
01:13:11,802 --> 01:13:13,303
What do you think they want?

1400
01:13:13,762 --> 01:13:14,930
Ease.

1401
01:13:15,013 --> 01:13:17,891
People will trade quality
for ease every time.

1402
01:13:18,058 --> 01:13:21,228
It may be crap,
but hey, it's convenient.

1403
01:13:21,395 --> 01:13:23,105
Yeah. Kind of like this case.

1404
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:24,272
What?
The Screenslaver?

1405
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:26,233
Yeah, something's not
sitting right.

1406
01:13:26,316 --> 01:13:27,651
It was too easy.

1407
01:13:27,818 --> 01:13:30,237
That was too easy?
Wow.

1408
01:13:31,154 --> 01:13:33,073
Funny.
What?

1409
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,658
Look at that.

1410
01:13:34,825 --> 01:13:38,620
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

1411
01:13:38,787 --> 01:13:39,830
What?

1412
01:13:40,956 --> 01:13:42,833
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

1413
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:43,917
It is.

1414
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:46,420
Then how come
Screenslaver has it?

1415
01:13:46,586 --> 01:13:48,171
Maybe he hacked it?

1416
01:13:48,338 --> 01:13:50,716
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that...

1417
01:13:50,882 --> 01:13:53,343
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

1418
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:55,387
Maybe he wanted you
to find him.

1419
01:13:55,554 --> 01:13:56,888
He wanted to get caught?

1420
01:13:57,055 --> 01:13:59,057
He wanted you to win.

1421
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:01,309
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

1422
01:14:01,476 --> 01:14:02,769
If he's smart enough
to conceive

1423
01:14:02,853 --> 01:14:04,021
of technology like this...

1424
01:14:04,187 --> 01:14:06,690
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

1425
01:14:06,857 --> 01:14:08,734
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

1426
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:09,818
So?

1427
01:14:09,985 --> 01:14:11,570
Einstein was a patent clerk.

1428
01:14:11,737 --> 01:14:13,780
Look, you won.
You got the guy who...

1429
01:14:13,947 --> 01:14:16,199
Wait. AII Screenslaver
needs to do

1430
01:14:16,283 --> 01:14:17,325
to hypnotize someone...

1431
01:14:17,492 --> 01:14:19,578
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

1432
01:14:19,745 --> 01:14:23,749
But what if the screen doesn't
look like a screen?

1433
01:14:26,293 --> 01:14:30,422
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy...

1434
01:14:30,589 --> 01:14:31,965
but he was controlled
by the screens

1435
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:33,050
built into his glasses...

1436
01:14:34,468 --> 01:14:36,303
You are good.

1437
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,641
Look, the robot!

1438
01:14:41,725 --> 01:14:42,726
It's taking off.

1439
01:14:42,893 --> 01:14:43,977
I'm not getting
a reading yet.

1440
01:14:44,144 --> 01:14:45,687
Press fire?
Now!

1441
01:14:48,815 --> 01:14:49,900
More power.

1442
01:14:50,067 --> 01:14:51,485
Oh, I hope
this works, Dad.

1443
01:14:52,861 --> 01:14:55,572
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

1444
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:57,824
Seventeen hours.

1445
01:14:58,617 --> 01:15:00,452
How do you feel?

1446
01:15:00,952 --> 01:15:02,079
Super .

1447
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:04,289
You got it, Dad.
Hurray!

1448
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,292
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate

1449
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:09,294
you watching
Jack-Jack for me, E.

1450
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:12,422
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

1451
01:15:12,589 --> 01:15:14,257
Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

1452
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:15,634
My rates are far too high.

1453
01:15:15,717 --> 01:15:16,927
Oh, uh...

1454
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,262
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

1455
01:15:19,429 --> 01:15:21,139
He is bright
and I am stimulating.

1456
01:15:21,306 --> 01:15:22,724
We deserve each other.

1457
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:25,560
Your child is a polymorph.

1458
01:15:25,644 --> 01:15:28,021
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

1459
01:15:28,188 --> 01:15:29,773
It is not unknown for supers

1460
01:15:29,856 --> 01:15:31,441
to have more than one power
when young...

1461
01:15:31,608 --> 01:15:34,277
but this little one has many.

1462
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:37,364
Yes, you have many powers.

1463
01:15:51,253 --> 01:15:53,255
I understand
your lack of sleep

1464
01:15:53,338 --> 01:15:54,589
and coherency, Robert.

1465
01:15:54,756 --> 01:15:56,174
Babies can be anything,

1466
01:15:56,258 --> 01:15:57,801
and your child
is no exception.

1467
01:15:57,968 --> 01:16:00,679
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

1468
01:16:00,846 --> 01:16:03,765
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

1469
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:06,393
Auntie Edna stayed up
all night...

1470
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,062
making sure you look fabulous
in your many forms.

1471
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:11,565
What are you...
You're putting him in the...

1472
01:16:11,731 --> 01:16:12,941
In the chamber, Robert.

1473
01:16:13,108 --> 01:16:14,693
He is part
of the demonstration

1474
01:16:14,776 --> 01:16:15,819
and will be fine.

1475
01:16:15,986 --> 01:16:17,904
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

1476
01:16:17,988 --> 01:16:19,489
who has multiple powers...

1477
01:16:19,656 --> 01:16:22,033
and no control over them, yes?

1478
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:24,244
Huh. That sums it up.

1479
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:25,829
I often work to music

1480
01:16:25,912 --> 01:16:28,665
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

1481
01:16:28,832 --> 01:16:30,709
Specifically, Mozart.

1482
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:32,502
I blended Kevlar

1483
01:16:32,586 --> 01:16:34,212
with carbyne
for durability under duress...

1484
01:16:34,617 --> 01:16:36,536
and cotton for comfort.

1485
01:16:36,703 --> 01:16:39,831
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors...

1486
01:16:39,998 --> 01:16:42,959
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

1487
01:16:43,126 --> 01:16:46,004
Oh, Lord!
What is he doing?

1488
01:16:46,171 --> 01:16:49,090
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

1489
01:16:49,257 --> 01:16:51,342
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker...

1490
01:16:51,509 --> 01:16:53,470
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

1491
01:16:53,636 --> 01:16:56,181
Oh, no. Cookies.
I gotta get cookies!

1492
01:16:56,347 --> 01:16:58,141
You do not need cookies.

1493
01:16:58,308 --> 01:17:00,560
As I learned quite painfully
last night...

1494
01:17:00,727 --> 01:17:02,520
any solution involving cookies

1495
01:17:02,604 --> 01:17:05,356
will inevitably result
in the demon baby.

1496
01:17:07,994 --> 01:17:08,995
Combustion imminent?

1497
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:10,955
What does that mean?

1498
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,623
It means fire, Robert,

1499
01:17:12,707 --> 01:17:14,876
for which the suit
has countermeasures.

1500
01:17:15,043 --> 01:17:17,754
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames

1501
01:17:17,837 --> 01:17:19,756
before he trips
the sprinkler system.

1502
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:23,551
The flame retardant

1503
01:17:23,634 --> 01:17:25,803
is blackberry lavender,
darling.

1504
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,639
Effective, edible,
and delicious.

1505
01:17:28,806 --> 01:17:32,060
Well, what do you know?
That is useful.

1506
01:17:32,226 --> 01:17:34,979
Although, I have doubtlessly
exceeded your expectations

1507
01:17:35,063 --> 01:17:36,898
for a single night's work...

1508
01:17:37,065 --> 01:17:38,399
the suit and device contain

1509
01:17:38,483 --> 01:17:40,443
a few more features
we need to discuss.

1510
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:43,154
Thanks again, E,
for everything.

1511
01:17:43,237 --> 01:17:44,614
How much do I owe you for...

1512
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:47,617
Pish-posh, darling. Your bill
will be covered by my fee...

1513
01:17:47,784 --> 01:17:49,869
for being Mr. Incredible,
Elastigirl,

1514
01:17:49,952 --> 01:17:52,413
and Frozone's
exclusive designer...

1515
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,874
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time.

1516
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,918
But babysitting this one...

1517
01:17:57,085 --> 01:17:59,879
I do for free, darling.

1518
01:18:17,563 --> 01:18:18,648
I would resist

1519
01:18:18,731 --> 01:18:19,982
the temptation to stretch.

1520
01:18:20,149 --> 01:18:23,194
The temperature around you
is well below freezing.

1521
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:25,863
Try to stretch
and you'll break.

1522
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:28,533
So, you're the Screenslaver.

1523
01:18:28,699 --> 01:18:31,077
Yes and no.

1524
01:18:32,078 --> 01:18:33,830
Let's say,
I created the character

1525
01:18:33,913 --> 01:18:35,623
and pre-recorded the messages.

1526
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:37,166
Does Winston know?

1527
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:40,086
That I'm the Screenslaver?
Of course not.

1528
01:18:40,253 --> 01:18:42,588
Can you imagine
what Mr. Free Enterprise

1529
01:18:42,672 --> 01:18:44,465
would do
with my hypnosis technology?

1530
01:18:44,632 --> 01:18:45,925
Worse than what you're doing?

1531
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:48,219
Hey, I'm using the technology

1532
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:49,804
to destroy
people's trust in it.

1533
01:18:50,054 --> 01:18:52,306
Like I'm using superheroes.

1534
01:18:52,473 --> 01:18:53,891
Who did I put in jail?

1535
01:18:54,058 --> 01:18:55,393
Pizza delivery guy.

1536
01:18:55,476 --> 01:18:56,978
Seemed the right height,
build.

1537
01:18:57,145 --> 01:18:59,188
He gave you
a pretty good fight.

1538
01:18:59,355 --> 01:19:00,940
I should say I gave you

1539
01:19:01,023 --> 01:19:02,400
a pretty good fight
through him.

1540
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:04,152
But it doesn't
bother you

1541
01:19:04,235 --> 01:19:05,820
that an innocent man
is in jail?

1542
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:09,115
Eh, he was surly
and the pizza was cold.

1543
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:10,658
I counted on you.

1544
01:19:11,033 --> 01:19:12,285
That's why you failed.

1545
01:19:12,451 --> 01:19:13,536
What?

1546
01:19:13,703 --> 01:19:16,664
Why would you count on me?
Because I built you a bike?

1547
01:19:16,831 --> 01:19:19,000
Because my brother
knows the words

1548
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,084
to your theme song?

1549
01:19:20,251 --> 01:19:21,669
We don't know each other.

1550
01:19:21,836 --> 01:19:23,588
But you can
count on me anyway.

1551
01:19:23,754 --> 01:19:25,214
I am supposed to, aren't I?

1552
01:19:25,381 --> 01:19:27,675
Because you have
some strange abilities

1553
01:19:27,758 --> 01:19:28,926
and a shiny costume...

1554
01:19:29,093 --> 01:19:31,470
the rest of us are supposed
to put our lives

1555
01:19:31,554 --> 01:19:33,431
into your gloved hands.

1556
01:19:33,598 --> 01:19:35,975
That's what
my father believed.

1557
01:19:36,142 --> 01:19:39,604
When our home was broken into,
my mother wanted to hide.

1558
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:42,064
Begged my father
to use the safe room.

1559
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:46,444
But Father insisted they call
his superhero friends.

1560
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:50,990
He died,
pointlessly, stupidly...

1561
01:19:51,574 --> 01:19:53,910
waiting for heroes
to save the day.

1562
01:19:54,076 --> 01:19:55,578
But why would you...

1563
01:19:55,661 --> 01:19:56,913
Your brother...
Is a child!

1564
01:19:57,747 --> 01:19:59,373
He remembers the time

1565
01:19:59,457 --> 01:20:01,500
when we had parents
and superheroes.

1566
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:05,421
So, like a child,
Winston conflates the two.

1567
01:20:05,588 --> 01:20:09,050
Mommy and Daddy went away
because supers went away.

1568
01:20:09,217 --> 01:20:11,802
Our sweet parents were fools

1569
01:20:11,886 --> 01:20:13,721
to put their lives
in anybody else's hands.

1570
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:16,057
Superheroes keep us weak.

1571
01:20:16,891 --> 01:20:18,559
Are you gonna kill me?

1572
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:20,311
Nah.

1573
01:20:22,355 --> 01:20:23,689
Using you is better.

1574
01:20:23,856 --> 01:20:26,734
You're gonna help me make
supers illegal...

1575
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:28,361
forever.

1576
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:34,867
Dada. Dada.

1577
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,954
Ready?
Laser eyes.

1578
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:40,581
Stop.

1579
01:20:40,665 --> 01:20:41,666
Wow!
Yeah !

1580
01:20:41,749 --> 01:20:43,376
Yay, Jack-Jack!
Yeah, baby!

1581
01:20:43,459 --> 01:20:44,460
And that's not all.
Watch this.

1582
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:46,337
Jack-Jack, blaster ready?

1583
01:20:51,175 --> 01:20:53,261
No way.
That is crazy cool.

1584
01:20:53,344 --> 01:20:54,387
My turn.
I get to blast him first!

1585
01:20:54,553 --> 01:20:55,554
Let me try. I want him.
Give him to me.

1586
01:20:55,638 --> 01:20:56,931
Hey, I'm just demonstrating.

1587
01:20:57,014 --> 01:20:59,392
No firing the baby around
the house, you understand?

1588
01:20:59,558 --> 01:21:02,103
This is potentially
dangerous...

1589
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:04,855
and we're trying to teach him
to control his powers, okay?

1590
01:21:05,243 --> 01:21:06,786
Stop. See the screen.

1591
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:11,415
He vanished!
That's really cool!

1592
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:13,668
Okay, good. Use the thing.

1593
01:21:13,751 --> 01:21:15,836
That's the current readout.
Click it. See the readout?

1594
01:21:16,003 --> 01:21:17,797
Dimension four. See the shape?

1595
01:21:17,964 --> 01:21:19,715
That's the room.
See where he is in relation?

1596
01:21:19,882 --> 01:21:20,883
So, where is he?

1597
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:23,886
He's... there!

1598
01:21:25,285 --> 01:21:26,953
Okay. Come out.
Num-num cookie?

1599
01:21:28,955 --> 01:21:30,332
Yay, Jack-Jack!
Yeah, Jack-Jack!

1600
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:32,167
That's really cool.

1601
01:21:38,757 --> 01:21:40,759
Hello?
EIastigirl's in trouble.

1602
01:21:40,926 --> 01:21:42,260
What? What happened to her?

1603
01:21:42,427 --> 01:21:43,762
Sorry to tell you
on the phone.

1604
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:45,472
Meet me on our ship
at DEVTECH.

1605
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:47,724
The ship at DEVTECH.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1606
01:21:47,891 --> 01:21:49,851
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

1607
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:51,645
Lucius? Bob.
Helen's in trouble.

1608
01:21:51,812 --> 01:21:53,230
I need someone
to watch the kids.

1609
01:21:53,396 --> 01:21:54,773
Suit up. It might get weird.

1610
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,650
I'll be there.
ASAP. Fifteen tops.

1611
01:21:56,817 --> 01:21:58,485
Where are you
going ASAP?

1612
01:21:58,568 --> 01:22:00,111
You better be back ASAP!

1613
01:22:00,278 --> 01:22:01,488
And leaving that suit.

1614
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:03,156
I gotta go.
I'll be home soon.

1615
01:22:03,323 --> 01:22:04,533
Lucius will be here sooner.

1616
01:22:04,616 --> 01:22:06,701
No firing the baby
around the house, okay?

1617
01:22:06,868 --> 01:22:08,578
What's at the ship at DEVTECH?

1618
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:10,747
And why are you
in your Supersuit?

1619
01:22:23,009 --> 01:22:24,511
Is that Mom's supersuit?

1620
01:22:24,678 --> 01:22:26,304
She may need it.
You never know.

1621
01:22:26,471 --> 01:22:28,098
What's going on?

1622
01:22:28,265 --> 01:22:30,141
I don't know,
but Dad called Lucius

1623
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:32,102
after getting a call
about Mom...

1624
01:22:32,269 --> 01:22:33,395
and then left.

1625
01:22:33,562 --> 01:22:35,146
I thought you renounced
superheroes.

1626
01:22:35,313 --> 01:22:38,233
Yeah, well,
I renounce my renunciation.

1627
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,568
Put that on.

1628
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:53,206
Hello there, little fella.

1629
01:22:53,373 --> 01:22:54,916
Hello.

1630
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:56,209
You kids aren't safe.

1631
01:22:56,293 --> 01:22:57,502
The Beavers sent us
to take you...

1632
01:22:57,669 --> 01:23:00,422
Well,
isn't that redundant?

1633
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:03,300
The Beavers “Net sent me here
to guard the house.

1634
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,346
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

1635
01:23:08,513 --> 01:23:10,390
I get it, managerial screw-up.

1636
01:23:10,557 --> 01:23:13,310
Tell Winston I handled it.
You understand, Ms...

1637
01:23:13,476 --> 01:23:14,644
Voyd .

1638
01:23:14,728 --> 01:23:15,729
Ms. Voyd.

1639
01:23:17,574 --> 01:23:18,575
Drive safely.

1640
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:32,172
The thing is, he wants us
to bring you, too.

1641
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:33,423
Hey.

1642
01:23:35,266 --> 01:23:36,518
That isn't gonna
hold them long.

1643
01:23:37,644 --> 01:23:39,229
Dash, grab the baby!

1644
01:23:42,065 --> 01:23:43,066
Spread out!

1645
01:23:45,527 --> 01:23:46,528
Whoa!
Oh!

1646
01:23:47,195 --> 01:23:48,655
Dash!

1647
01:23:49,114 --> 01:23:50,490
We gotta get to my car.

1648
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:01,876
What? What's going on?

1649
01:24:02,043 --> 01:24:03,128
Little fella!

1650
01:24:12,804 --> 01:24:13,930
GROWLS}
{GASP S)

1651
01:24:21,813 --> 01:24:22,939
It worked!

1652
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:30,706
Incredibile, windows down!

1653
01:24:32,499 --> 01:24:33,500
Dive in!

1654
01:24:40,299 --> 01:24:42,718
Incredibile,
set voice identification.

1655
01:24:42,801 --> 01:24:44,136
Loudly, say your names.

1656
01:24:44,303 --> 01:24:46,972
Violet Parr.
Dashiell Robert Parr.

1657
01:24:51,467 --> 01:24:52,468
Lucius!

1658
01:24:52,802 --> 01:24:54,637
Incredibile, escape!

1659
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:04,313
Fill me in!

1660
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,148
Good news and bad news.
We found her.

1661
01:25:06,315 --> 01:25:07,566
She seems physically fine

1662
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:09,235
but she's had an encounter
with Screenslaver...

1663
01:25:09,402 --> 01:25:11,654
and she's acting
kind of strange. In here.

1664
01:25:15,491 --> 01:25:16,575
Strange how?

1665
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:26,043
Helen?

1666
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:28,546
Helen, what are you...

1667
01:25:37,263 --> 01:25:38,514
Helen, it's me.

1668
01:25:55,614 --> 01:25:57,491
Incredibile, pull over.

1669
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:05,207
We can't go to E's.

1670
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:07,501
You saw those goggles
they put on Lucius.

1671
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:09,462
They were wearing them, too.

1672
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:12,214
They're all under
someone's control.

1673
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:14,925
They've probably done
the same to Mom.

1674
01:26:16,385 --> 01:26:18,471
Okay. Bad guys after us.

1675
01:26:18,637 --> 01:26:20,181
No Mom, no Dad.

1676
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:21,474
No Lucius.

1677
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,144
But we have our powers,
this car...

1678
01:26:26,187 --> 01:26:29,648
and... what?

1679
01:26:41,827 --> 01:26:44,413
Incredibile,
take us to DEVTECH.

1680
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:50,169
The kids have escaped
in a tricked-out car,

1681
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:51,587
but we got Frozone.

1682
01:26:51,754 --> 01:26:54,548
Bring him to the ship
at DEVTECH immediately.

1683
01:27:00,893 --> 01:27:02,061
Aw, we missed 'em!

1684
01:27:02,478 --> 01:27:06,607
Oh, I wish the Incredibile
could follow that boat.

1685
01:27:09,402 --> 01:27:11,070
What did you do?
I don't know.

1686
01:27:11,237 --> 01:27:13,823
What did you do?
I didn't do anything!

1687
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:24,698
Wow, this car does
anything I say.

1688
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,166
We didn't plan this well.

1689
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:35,626
What do you mean?
We're here, aren't we?

1690
01:27:35,793 --> 01:27:37,253
Yes, we're here.

1691
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,797
We need to be up there.

1692
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,091
Hey...

1693
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:45,719
What if the Incredibile
has ejector seats?

1694
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:47,878
Wait, What? No.

1695
01:27:48,086 --> 01:27:49,504
Yeah, baby!
No, don't say any more...

1696
01:27:49,671 --> 01:27:51,006
Max power! Launch!

1697
01:27:58,597 --> 01:27:59,890
Come on.

1698
01:28:03,164 --> 01:28:04,707
Hello!
Glad you could come.

1699
01:28:04,874 --> 01:28:06,584
Welcome to the conference.

1700
01:28:17,136 --> 01:28:18,846
Our stars, where are they?

1701
01:28:19,055 --> 01:28:20,306
The event's about to start.

1702
01:28:20,473 --> 01:28:22,183
They didn't want to upstage
the others.

1703
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:24,060
They'll join for the signing.

1704
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:27,355
Welcome, guests!
You're in for a treat.

1705
01:28:27,563 --> 01:28:31,859
This ship is the largest
hydrofoil on the planet.

1706
01:28:32,026 --> 01:28:33,069
So, hold onto something...

1707
01:28:33,236 --> 01:28:35,655
because we're going
to open her up!

1708
01:28:54,215 --> 01:28:56,509
We need to find Mom and Dad.
Stay here.

1709
01:28:56,676 --> 01:28:57,677
I'm gonna search for them.

1710
01:28:57,802 --> 01:29:00,429
Wait! Who's gonna
watch Jack-Jack?

1711
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:02,505
Suck it up. I won't be long.

1712
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:05,049
Wait. Wait, but, but wait!

1713
01:29:05,216 --> 01:29:07,760
This is important.
They are in trouble.

1714
01:29:07,927 --> 01:29:10,638
It's up to us.
To us, understand?

1715
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:13,432
Keep him amused but quiet!

1716
01:29:14,725 --> 01:29:15,768
Ugh.

1717
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,533
Shh! Quiet!

1718
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:29,661
Huh?

1719
01:29:33,998 --> 01:29:34,999
Jack-Jack?

1720
01:29:45,009 --> 01:29:46,844
Jack-Jack?
Jack-Jack!

1721
01:30:20,211 --> 01:30:21,212
Jack-Jack!

1722
01:30:21,379 --> 01:30:22,964
The mesmerized supers
know we're here...

1723
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:25,508
but I found Mom and Dad...
Where's Jack-Jack?

1724
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:28,928
You lost him?
I gave you one thing to do!

1725
01:30:29,345 --> 01:30:30,513
The tracker. Use the tracker.

1726
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:35,959
He's going up?

1727
01:30:36,126 --> 01:30:38,170
He's in an elevator.
Let's go!

1728
01:30:40,297 --> 01:30:42,716
Hey, little baby.
Where are your parents?

1729
01:30:45,385 --> 01:30:47,304
And here they are, folks!

1730
01:30:47,387 --> 01:30:48,513
The supers who started
this whole thing.

1731
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,275
[told you
they'd be there in time.

1732
01:30:52,442 --> 01:30:54,819
Hey, did you make them
new masks?

1733
01:30:54,986 --> 01:30:56,821
Yeah. Night vision,
et cetera...

1734
01:30:56,905 --> 01:30:57,906
They look good, right?

1735
01:30:58,072 --> 01:30:59,949
80 simple,
even he can do it.

1736
01:31:00,116 --> 01:31:03,953
And we're back live in
three, two, one...

1737
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,580
This is a momentous occasion.

1738
01:31:05,747 --> 01:31:07,665
We've all managed
to accomplish

1739
01:31:07,749 --> 01:31:10,793
something extraordinarily rare
in today's world.

1740
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,670
We agree on something.

1741
01:31:15,882 --> 01:31:18,885
We agree to undo
a bad decision.

1742
01:31:19,052 --> 01:31:20,053
To make sure

1743
01:31:20,136 --> 01:31:22,013
a few extraordinarily
gifted members...

1744
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,891
of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.

1745
01:31:25,058 --> 01:31:28,186
To invite them once again
to use their gifts...

1746
01:31:28,353 --> 01:31:29,687
to benefit the world.

1747
01:31:29,854 --> 01:31:31,147
I thank all of you

1748
01:31:31,231 --> 01:31:34,275
for representing your nation's
commitment to superheroes.

1749
01:31:34,442 --> 01:31:36,569
With special thanks to
Ambassador Selick.

1750
01:31:36,736 --> 01:31:38,446
Yeah, it's okay.
Let her hear you.

1751
01:31:38,613 --> 01:31:39,864
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1752
01:31:40,031 --> 01:31:41,407
Thank you,
Ambassador,

1753
01:31:41,491 --> 01:31:43,534
for your early
and very crucial support.

1754
01:31:43,701 --> 01:31:46,120
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you...

1755
01:31:46,287 --> 01:31:47,914
to be the first signature

1756
01:31:47,997 --> 01:31:50,875
on the International
Superhero Accord.

1757
01:31:52,307 --> 01:31:54,184
There it is!

1758
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:09,658
Holy cow!

1759
01:32:11,061 --> 01:32:12,228
I know he's on fire.
Just put him out.

1760
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:20,654
They're coming.

1761
01:32:30,205 --> 01:32:31,498
Is it okay to give him that?

1762
01:32:31,665 --> 01:32:34,042
I wasn't hearing
any better ideas.

1763
01:32:58,733 --> 01:32:59,734
No!

1764
01:33:00,527 --> 01:33:02,070
Come on, Jack-Jack.

1765
01:33:02,153 --> 01:33:03,154
We have to go.

1766
01:33:03,321 --> 01:33:04,489
Cooke hum-hum?

1767
01:33:17,168 --> 01:33:19,713
Mama, Mama.
I see him. He's getting away!

1768
01:33:19,879 --> 01:33:21,089
Stand back.

1769
01:33:25,218 --> 01:33:27,220
Darn it!
He's heading for Mom.

1770
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:33,107
It is done.
The world is super again.

1771
01:33:38,612 --> 01:33:40,906
Group photo. Come on.
Group photo, everyone.

1772
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:43,325
Squeeze in. That's it.
Historic occasion.

1773
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:45,452
Everyone, smile.

1774
01:33:52,212 --> 01:33:53,964
Go on phase two.

1775
01:33:54,131 --> 01:33:56,425
Years of mandated
hiding and silence

1776
01:33:56,508 --> 01:33:58,051
have made us bitter.

1777
01:33:58,218 --> 01:33:59,845
You bring us out
into the light...

1778
01:34:00,012 --> 01:34:01,346
only to clean up the messes

1779
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:03,390
your lack
of discipline creates.

1780
01:34:03,557 --> 01:34:06,059
Your bodies
and your character are weak.

1781
01:34:06,226 --> 01:34:09,646
Your promises are empty,
and you will pay for it.

1782
01:34:09,813 --> 01:34:11,273
We no longer serve you.

1783
01:34:11,607 --> 01:34:15,068
We serve only us.
May the fittest survive.

1784
01:34:17,571 --> 01:34:18,864
Well, we, um...

1785
01:34:18,989 --> 01:34:21,366
Some very alarming
moments there...

1786
01:34:21,533 --> 01:34:24,036
before the, uh,
technical difficulties.

1787
01:34:24,202 --> 01:34:25,579
Please bear with us.

1788
01:34:38,603 --> 01:34:39,646
What?

1789
01:34:40,355 --> 01:34:41,731
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!

1790
01:34:41,898 --> 01:34:42,899
Hold! Let him talk.

1791
01:34:43,066 --> 01:34:45,026
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge. Repeat.

1792
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:46,152
Now.

1793
01:34:57,497 --> 01:34:58,957
A little further.

1794
01:34:59,124 --> 01:35:00,917
Little further. Stop.

1795
01:35:06,798 --> 01:35:08,758
What the... A baby?

1796
01:35:09,301 --> 01:35:11,177
Mom and Dad.
Uncle Lucius?

1797
01:35:13,847 --> 01:35:15,348
My mama.
Jack-Jack, no!

1798
01:35:18,518 --> 01:35:20,228
A super baby?

1799
01:35:25,233 --> 01:35:26,526
No,no,no!

1800
01:35:26,693 --> 01:35:27,694
Put him down!

1801
01:35:29,613 --> 01:35:30,947
Grab her!
No!

1802
01:35:31,114 --> 01:35:32,115
Hold Jack-Jack.

1803
01:35:40,675 --> 01:35:41,426
No!

1804
01:35:42,593 --> 01:35:44,220
Hey, it's me!

1805
01:35:44,387 --> 01:35:45,930
Yeah, that's what I thought
last time.

1806
01:35:46,014 --> 01:35:48,599
Kids, what are you...

1807
01:35:50,226 --> 01:35:52,312
You came for us?

1808
01:35:52,895 --> 01:35:53,896
Don't be mad.

1809
01:35:54,063 --> 01:35:56,649
Oh, sweetie,
how could I be mad?

1810
01:35:57,525 --> 01:35:58,985
I'm proud.

1811
01:35:59,986 --> 01:36:01,696
Not to break up
a tender moment,

1812
01:36:01,779 --> 01:36:03,072
but where are we?

1813
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:04,532
Is this DEVTECH's ship?

1814
01:36:04,949 --> 01:36:06,576
Evelyn Deavor
controls the Screenslaver...

1815
01:36:06,743 --> 01:36:08,953
and until a second ago, us.

1816
01:36:09,579 --> 01:36:11,622
Where's the crew?

1817
01:36:11,789 --> 01:36:13,666
Collision
detected. Correct course.

1818
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:15,001
Uh-oh.
Did I do that?

1819
01:36:15,168 --> 01:36:18,212
Mom, the suit?
Try this.

1820
01:36:20,798 --> 01:36:23,009
Phase Three.
Go on Phase Three!

1821
01:36:26,512 --> 01:36:28,681
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

1822
01:36:28,848 --> 01:36:29,932
I went to the house.

1823
01:36:30,099 --> 01:36:31,559
You didn't escape?
How did you not escape?

1824
01:36:31,726 --> 01:36:33,644
Hey! We just saved you!

1825
01:36:33,811 --> 01:36:35,813
Escape? Escape from who?

1826
01:36:38,775 --> 01:36:39,817
Those guys!

1827
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:45,031
What the. . .?
Jack-Jack has powers?

1828
01:36:45,198 --> 01:36:46,991
We know.
Fight now, talk later.

1829
01:37:03,841 --> 01:37:05,510
{SCREECHES)

1830
01:37:18,481 --> 01:37:20,525
{SCREECHES)
{YELPS)

1831
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:22,068
Jack-Jack.

1832
01:37:22,235 --> 01:37:23,403
Laser eyes!

1833
01:37:29,242 --> 01:37:30,326
{SCREECHES)
{YELPS)

1834
01:37:33,371 --> 01:37:34,372
Ah-ha!

1835
01:37:45,258 --> 01:37:46,300
Ugh.

1836
01:37:51,431 --> 01:37:52,890
Come with me, Winston.

1837
01:37:53,516 --> 01:37:55,268
Did I faint?
You'll be safe here.

1838
01:37:55,435 --> 01:37:57,228
Safe? Safe from what?

1839
01:37:58,604 --> 01:38:00,606
Where are the diplomats?
The supers?

1840
01:38:00,773 --> 01:38:01,899
Still hypnotized.

1841
01:38:01,983 --> 01:38:04,235
What have you done?

1842
01:38:08,698 --> 01:38:10,241
Evelyn, she's escaping.

1843
01:38:10,741 --> 01:38:12,869
Well, go after her.
Finish your mission.

1844
01:38:13,035 --> 01:38:15,163
I can't just go!
What about the kids?

1845
01:38:15,246 --> 01:38:17,415
Jack-Jack, who's gonna...
Mom!

1846
01:38:17,957 --> 01:38:19,750
Go. We've got this.

1847
01:38:21,627 --> 01:38:23,337
Voyd, come with me.

1848
01:38:23,504 --> 01:38:24,505
I'll go shut down the engine.

1849
01:38:24,672 --> 01:38:26,299
I'll try to slow the ship
from the bow.

1850
01:38:26,466 --> 01:38:29,302
Wait, someone's missing.
Where's the crusher guy?

1851
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:31,053
Strap in now!

1852
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,071
It's for your own good.

1853
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:49,865
No!

1854
01:38:50,282 --> 01:38:51,283
This is.

1855
01:39:02,938 --> 01:39:05,148
We're too late.
Get me up to the jet.

1856
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:32,050
Hey, you did this.
Can you undo it?

1857
01:39:32,217 --> 01:39:34,261
You want me to un-crush?

1858
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:36,221
What? No one's ever
asked for that?

1859
01:39:36,388 --> 01:39:39,016
No. To un-crush is silly.
Why un-crush?

1860
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:40,726
To get into the engine room.

1861
01:39:40,809 --> 01:39:41,894
Oh, forget it.
We don't have enough time.

1862
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,396
What if I said
to un-punch someone?

1863
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:45,480
What do you do?

1864
01:39:49,328 --> 01:39:50,996
Welcome aboard, Elastigirl.

1865
01:39:51,163 --> 01:39:52,623
Although
we haven't yet reached

1866
01:39:52,706 --> 01:39:53,999
our cruising altitude...

1867
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:58,003
feel free to roam about
the cabin.

1868
01:39:58,087 --> 01:40:00,381
Or just relax...

1869
01:40:00,548 --> 01:40:03,259
and let the cabin roam
about you.

1870
01:40:12,466 --> 01:40:14,301
I can't get
to the engine room!

1871
01:40:14,468 --> 01:40:15,927
We gotta do something!

1872
01:40:16,011 --> 01:40:17,387
Because trying to slow it down
ain't working.

1873
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:19,264
Hey! What about
turning the boat?

1874
01:40:19,431 --> 01:40:20,557
The steering's
been destroyed!

1875
01:40:20,724 --> 01:40:23,310
Dash means from the outside!
Yeah!

1876
01:40:23,477 --> 01:40:24,519
If we break off
one of the foils

1877
01:40:24,603 --> 01:40:25,604
and turn the rudder...

1878
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,772
we can veer the ship
away from the city!

1879
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:29,232
That might work.

1880
01:40:29,316 --> 01:40:30,442
I'II turn the front,
you turn the rear.

1881
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:32,903
Using the rudder?
That's underwater.

1882
01:40:32,986 --> 01:40:33,987
How am I supposed to get...

1883
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:36,072
All right.
Come on, kids.

1884
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:39,159
Dad, I know
this is going to work.

1885
01:40:39,326 --> 01:40:41,661
But if it doesn't,
and we crash...

1886
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:45,040
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship.

1887
01:40:45,207 --> 01:40:48,460
I should stay here.
With Jack-Jack.

1888
01:40:49,294 --> 01:40:50,462
That's my girl.

1889
01:40:50,754 --> 01:40:53,173
Remember, Bob,
we're both turning right!

1890
01:40:59,888 --> 01:41:01,640
You know what's sad?

1891
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,020
If it weren't
for your core beliefs...

1892
01:41:07,187 --> 01:41:09,523
I think we could have been
good friends.

1893
01:41:10,774 --> 01:41:12,442
At least...

1894
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,403
I have core beliefs.

1895
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,323
We have breaking news...

1896
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,659
While there is
still no radio contact,

1897
01:41:20,742 --> 01:41:22,118
the ship
has changed direction...

1898
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:24,829
and is heading towards land
at a high rate of speed.

1899
01:41:29,209 --> 01:41:30,460
So, Dash...

1900
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,505
I am going to the rudder.

1901
01:41:33,672 --> 01:41:36,424
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

1902
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,426
Okay, Dad.
Now lower me down...

1903
01:41:42,722 --> 01:41:46,059
The reputations of superheroes
are ruined.

1904
01:41:46,226 --> 01:41:49,312
You will never
become legal. Ever.

1905
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:51,147
Never?

1906
01:41:51,231 --> 01:41:52,440
No.

1907
01:41:52,816 --> 01:41:54,526
Ever?
No.

1908
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:57,988
Not even a little
smidgee-widgee?

1909
01:41:58,154 --> 01:41:59,364
Oh, hypoxia.

1910
01:41:59,531 --> 01:42:01,449
When you don't have
enough oxygen,

1911
01:42:01,533 --> 01:42:03,326
things seem really silly.

1912
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,960
Things get sillier

1913
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:14,004
and sillier and then you die.

1914
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,964
I don't wanna die.

1915
01:42:16,131 --> 01:42:17,799
Ah, nobody does.

1916
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:19,759
Really.

1917
01:42:19,843 --> 01:42:22,178
Not such
a bad way to go.

1918
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:43,116
Everyone, we need to get
to the back of the ship.

1919
01:42:43,283 --> 01:42:45,619
AII supers,
protect your ambassadors!

1920
01:42:46,578 --> 01:42:47,912
Follow.

1921
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:53,084
Dad's been underwater
for too long.

1922
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:02,761
We gotta pull him up.

1923
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:04,304
Wait. It's too soon.

1924
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:19,694
I'm gonna press the button!

1925
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:20,862
Not yet!

1926
01:43:35,919 --> 01:43:37,629
It's turning. It's working.

1927
01:43:41,508 --> 01:43:43,468
Now!
Dash, now!

1928
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,014
Save yourself. Make a chute.

1929
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:52,394
Make a chute. Make a chute.

1930
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,603
Make a chute!

1931
01:43:56,398 --> 01:43:58,191
Helen!
Brace yourselves!

1932
01:44:06,408 --> 01:44:07,992
Crash positions!

1933
01:44:26,636 --> 01:44:27,721
Whoo.

1934
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:32,183
I missed
Jack-Jack's first power?

1935
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:34,686
Actually, you missed
the first 17.

1936
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:36,354
Oh!

1937
01:44:48,283 --> 01:44:51,786
The fact that you saved me
doesn't make you right.

1938
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:54,539
But it does make you alive.

1939
01:44:54,706 --> 01:44:56,166
And I'm grateful for that.

1940
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:59,002
I'm sorry,
but she'll go to prison.

1941
01:44:59,753 --> 01:45:01,087
Well, I'm sorry she's rich

1942
01:45:01,171 --> 01:45:03,590
and will probably get no more
than a slap on the wrist.

1943
01:45:03,757 --> 01:45:06,509
First of all, Violet,
I like you.

1944
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:09,304
And who knows
what the future may bring...

1945
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:12,640
but I have a good feeling
about all of you.

1946
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:14,768
Hmm. Good feeling.

1947
01:45:14,851 --> 01:45:16,394
Should we be worried?

1948
01:45:16,478 --> 01:45:18,772
You guys got the next shift.
I'm beat. Oh!

1949
01:45:19,105 --> 01:45:20,899
I saw what you did back there.
That was incredible!

1950
01:45:21,065 --> 01:45:22,192
No pun intended.

1951
01:45:22,597 --> 01:45:23,973
Sorry I had
to punch you.

1952
01:45:25,683 --> 01:45:28,978
Yeah, baby! My sweet ride!

1953
01:45:41,459 --> 01:45:44,796
And in recognition
of the extraordinary service

1954
01:45:44,879 --> 01:45:46,005
they have demonstrated...

1955
01:45:46,172 --> 01:45:48,591
the legal status
of superheroes

1956
01:45:48,674 --> 01:45:50,802
is hereby restored.

1957
01:45:59,858 --> 01:46:01,652
You don't know me, do you?

1958
01:46:01,819 --> 01:46:02,986
No, I don't...

1959
01:46:03,153 --> 01:46:04,488
Wait.

1960
01:46:04,655 --> 01:46:06,407
Are you the girl
with the water?

1961
01:46:06,573 --> 01:46:08,158
I'm Violet Parr.

1962
01:46:09,076 --> 01:46:10,661
I'm Tony.
Okay.

1963
01:46:10,828 --> 01:46:13,163
You split up into
separate groups and stuff...

1964
01:46:21,509 --> 01:46:23,886
Tony, this is my mom.
Pleased to meet you.

1965
01:46:24,053 --> 01:46:26,055
This is my dad.
Oh, we've met.

1966
01:46:26,222 --> 01:46:28,182
And this is embarrassing.

1967
01:46:28,349 --> 01:46:29,392
Charmed, I'm sure.

1968
01:46:29,558 --> 01:46:31,602
My little brother, Dash.

1969
01:46:31,769 --> 01:46:33,646
And the baby
is Jack-Jack.

1970
01:46:33,813 --> 01:46:36,941
I tried to limit it
to one parent.

1971
01:46:37,108 --> 01:46:39,485
We're all going to a movie,
too, Tony. Don't mind us.

1972
01:46:39,652 --> 01:46:40,653
We'll be sitting

1973
01:46:40,736 --> 01:46:41,904
on the other side
of the theater.

1974
01:46:42,071 --> 01:46:43,364
Not watching you.

1975
01:46:43,824 --> 01:46:45,742
He's kidding.

1976
01:46:45,826 --> 01:46:48,578
They are only dropping us off
at the theater.

1977
01:46:48,745 --> 01:46:51,415
They have other things to do.

1978
01:46:51,581 --> 01:46:54,001
So, you guys are close,
I guess.

1979
01:46:54,167 --> 01:46:56,295
Yeah, I guess.
We can get closer.

1980
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:57,879
Bob.

1981
01:47:12,484 --> 01:47:13,611
Stop! Let us out!

1982
01:47:13,777 --> 01:47:15,321
Here, large popcorn,
small soda.

1983
01:47:15,487 --> 01:47:17,531
Save me a seat, center,
about eight rows back.

1984
01:47:18,073 --> 01:47:20,993
I'll be back before
the previews are over.

1
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,574
This is Berk...

2
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,828
the best-kept secret
this side of, well, anywhere.

3
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,915
Granted, it may not look like much,
but this wet heap of rock...

4
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,127
packs more than a few surprises.

5
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:35,470
Life here is amazing,
just not for the faint of heart.

6
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:39,849
You see, where most folks enjoy hobbies
like whittling or needlepoint...

7
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,518
we Berkians prefer...

8
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,563
a little something we like to call...

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,734
dragon racing!

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,085
I'm sorry, Fishlegs. Did you want that?

11
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,881
Snotlout, that was mine!

12
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,257
Here you go, babe.

13
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,009
Did I tell you
that you look amazing today...

14
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,302
because you do.

15
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,222
Come on, Barf.
It's starting to stink around here.

16
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,182
Nope. Still hates you.

17
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,142
Let's blow this place, Belch!

18
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,228
All right!

19
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,944
Yeah!

20
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,988
That's nine for the Twins...

21
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,241
Astrid lags with three.

22
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,245
Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with none.

23
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,871
And Hiccup is...

24
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,749
nowhere to be found.

25
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,379
Scared him off with the big talk,
didn't you, Stoick?

26
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,090
What are you doing, Snotlout?

27
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,633
They're gonna win now.

28
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,177
She's my princess.
Whatever she wants, she gets.

29
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,347
Ruffnut?
Didn't she try to bury you alive?

30
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,640
Only for a few hours.

31
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,021
Now, dragons used to be
a bit of a problem here...

32
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,481
but that was 5 years ago.

33
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,819
Now, they have all moved in.
And really, why wouldn't they?

34
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,779
We have custom stables...

35
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,990
all-you-can-eat feeding stations...

36
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,492
a full-service dragon wash...

37
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,831
even top-of-the-line fire prevention
if I do say so myself.

38
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,542
It's time, Gobber.

39
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,294
Righty-ho. Last lap!

40
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,925
The Black Sheep!
Come on, Stormfly.

41
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,844
We can still win this thing!

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,639
Come on, Barf!
Let's go!

43
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,641
Go, Meatlug!

44
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,437
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

45
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,856
This is your big moment.

46
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,941
Have a nice flight!

47
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,321
Up, up, up!

48
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,117
No!
Yes!

49
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,744
Good job, Meatlug.

50
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,122
Here you go, darling.
Mine is worth ten.

51
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,207
Yeah! The Black Sheep!

52
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,836
You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?

53
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,171
I'm totally winning!

54
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,756
We're winning together!

55
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,966
No!

56
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,137
No one can stop me now!

57
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,806
Except for me.
We're attached, genius.

58
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,476
Quit trying to steal all my glory!
Hey!

59
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,728
Get them, Astrid!

60
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,064
It's my glory!
Always ruining everything!

61
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,231
No sheep, no glory!

62
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,316
Gotcha!

63
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,194
Astrid!

64
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,654
Well played!

65
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,616
That's my future daughter-in-law!

66
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,412
Excuse me.

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,580
Stormfly!

68
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,304
That's 1 3! Astrid takes the game!

69
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,434
Yep, Berk is pretty much perfect.

70
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,061
All of my hard work has paid off.

71
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:17,108
And it's a good thing, too, because
with Vikings on the backs of dragons...

72
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,610
the world just got a whole lot bigger.

73
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,920
Yeah!

74
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,089
So what do you think, bud?

75
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,841
You wanna give this another shot?

76
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,011
Toothless! Lt will be fine.

77
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,474
Ready?

78
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:45,988
Yeah!

79
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,154
This is amazing!

80
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,156
No longer amazing!

81
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,324
Toothless!

82
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,245
Oh, no!

83
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,308
That really came out of nowhere.

84
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,985
We have to work
on your solo gliding there, bud.

85
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,570
That locked-up tail...

86
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,115
makes for some
pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, hey?

87
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,343
Looks like we found another one, bud.

88
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,475
What, do you want an apology?

89
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,687
Is that why you're pouting,
big baby boo?

90
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,356
Well, try this on!

91
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,693
You feeling it yet?

92
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,654
Picking up on all of my
heartfelt remorse?

93
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,491
Come on, come on.

94
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,577
You wouldn't hurt a one-legged...

95
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,124
You're right! You're right!
You win. You win.

96
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,295
He's down. And it's ugly.

97
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,298
Dragons and Vikings, enemies again...

98
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,842
locked in combat to the bitter...

99
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,560
You know that doesn't wash out.

100
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,337
So, what should we name it?

101
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,173
Itchy Armpit it is.

102
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,884
What do you reckon, bud?

103
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,221
Think we might find a few
Timberjacks in those woods?

104
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,640
The odd Whispering Death or two
in the rocks?

105
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,896
Who knows? Maybe we'll finally
track down another Night Fury.

106
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,191
Wouldn't that be something?

107
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,820
So, what do you say?
Just keep going?

108
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,206
Afternoon, milady.

109
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,083
Where have you been?

110
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,294
Hi.

111
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,922
Winning races, what else?

112
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,716
The real question is...

113
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,967
where have you been?

114
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,385
Avoiding my dad.

115
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,220
Oh, no. What happened now?

116
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,472
You're gonna love this.

117
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,808
I wake up. The sun is shining.

118
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,644
Terrible Terrors
are singing on the rooftop.

119
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,104
I saunter down to breakfast...

120
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,481
thinking all is right with the world
and I get...

121
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,942
Son, we need to talk.

122
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:56,363
Not now, Dad. I got a whole day
of goofing off to get started.

123
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,241
Okay, first of all,
I don't sound like that.

124
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,826
Who is this character?

125
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,913
And second, what is that thing
you're doing with my shoulders?

126
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,167
Yeah, that's a truly flattering
impersonation.

127
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,044
Anyway, he goes...

128
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,839
You're the pride of Berk, son,
and I couldn't be prouder.

129
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,507
Aw, thanks, Dad.

130
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,260
I'm pretty impressed with myself, too.

131
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,221
When have I ever
done that with my hands?

132
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,931
You just did.

133
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,727
Okay. Just hold still.

134
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,355
This is very serious.

135
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,400
You're all grown up...

136
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,362
and since no chief could ask
for a better successor...

137
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,906
I've decided...
To make you chief!

138
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,867
Oh, my gods! Hiccup, that's amazing!

139
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,331
You're gonna wear out the spring coil.
The calibration is very sensitive.

140
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,879
Yeah...

141
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,299
so this is what I'm dealing with.

142
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,467
What did you tell him?

143
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,304
I didn't. By the time he turned around,
I was gone.

144
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,308
It's a lot of responsibility.

145
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,895
The map will have to wait for sure...

146
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,898
and I'll need to fly Toothless,
since you'll be too busy, but...

147
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,529
It's not me, Astrid.

148
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:23,367
All those speeches and planning,
and running the village, that's his thing.

149
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,369
I think you're missing the point.

150
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,414
I mean, chief. What an honor.

151
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,457
I'd be pretty excited.

152
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,043
I'm not like you.

153
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,170
You know exactly who you are.

154
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,131
You always have.

155
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,842
But I'm still looking.

156
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,344
I know that I'm not my father...

157
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,139
and I never met my mother...

158
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,766
so what does that make me?

159
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:57,359
What you're searching for
isn't out there, Hiccup.

160
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,319
It's in here.

161
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,489
Maybe you just don't see it yet.

162
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,992
Maybe.

163
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,035
But you know...

164
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,663
there is something out there.

165
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,665
Hiccup...

166
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,534
Stay close.

167
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,757
What happened here?

168
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,140
All right, easy, bud.

169
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:11,892
Hiccup!

170
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,227
Fire!

171
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,478
Astrid, look out!

172
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,316
Hiccup!

173
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,489
Watch the tail!

174
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,159
Tie those legs up!

175
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,705
Is that what I think it is?

176
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,873
Stop!

177
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,500
Stormfly!

178
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,169
What are you doing?

179
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,673
Back again?

180
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,385
Soil my britches.

181
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,096
That is a Night Fury.

182
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,348
I thought they were all gone for good.

183
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,142
It looks like our luck's had a turn
for the better, lads.

184
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,478
Don't think Drago has one of those...

185
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,188
in his dragon army.

186
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,815
Dragon army?

187
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,650
Look, we don't want any trouble.

188
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,446
You should have thought of that
before you stole all of our dragons...

189
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,740
and blasted our fort to bits!

190
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,077
What are you talking about?

191
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,954
You think we did this?

192
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:19,918
Dragon trapping is hard enough work as
it is without do-gooder dragon riders...

193
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,712
sneaking in to rescue them.

194
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,589
What do-gooder?

195
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,592
There are other dragon riders?

196
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,761
You mean other than your thieving friend
from last night? You tell me.

197
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,848
You may have an ice-spitting dragon
on your side...

198
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,601
but we still have a quota to fill.

199
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,895
How do you suppose
we explain this mess to Drago Bludvist?

200
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,524
Drago what-fist?
Does anything you say make sense?

201
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,653
He's expecting a new shipment of dragons
for his army by tomorrow.

202
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,198
And Drago don't take well to excuses.

203
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,034
This is what he gave me...

204
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,453
last time I showed up empty-handed.

205
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,081
He promised to be far less understanding
in the future.

206
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,293
All right, look, we don't know anything
about a dragon thief...

207
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,836
or an ice-spitting dragon...

208
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,174
or your lunatic boss
and his dragon army, okay?

209
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,135
Just give us back our dragon
and we'll go...

210
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,929
strange, hostile person
whom we've never met.

211
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,973
Where are my manners?

212
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm Eret...

213
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,560
son of Eret.

214
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,897
Finest dragon trapper alive.

215
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,607
After all...

216
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,319
it's not just anyone
who can capture a Night Fury.

217
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,740
And this is Toothless.
He says we're going. Now.

218
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,743
They all say that.

219
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,911
Rush 'em, lads!

220
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,294
Stormfly! Come on!

221
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,295
Go! Go!

222
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,094
You will never
hold on to those dragons...

223
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,512
you hear me?

224
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,348
Drago is coming for them all!

225
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,477
Come on, Meatlug!

226
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,782
Hey, there, Stoick!
Hey, how are you? Beautiful day.

227
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,243
Hello, Spitelout. Great race.

228
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,911
Sorry, Mrs. Ack.

229
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,079
Any sign of him?

230
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,624
He's probably flown off the
edge of the world by now.

231
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,960
Are you sure you want that kid
running the village?

232
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,087
You can still delay your retirement.

233
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,131
He's ready. You'll see.

234
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,009
There he is!

235
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,430
The pride of Berk!

236
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,599
Who finally decided
to show up for work. Yay.

237
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,393
Sorry. Got held up.

238
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,769
Dad, could I have a word?

239
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,980
Something you're itching to tell me?

240
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,733
Not quite the itch
you're thinking of, but yes.

241
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,777
Good man! Now, lesson one.

242
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,030
A chief's first duty is to his people,
so... 41?

243
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,241
Can we just talk in private?
Forty...

244
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,618
That's me! That's me! I'm next!

245
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,078
If we could just talk...

246
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,080
Excuse me. I have been here all day.

247
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,708
Okay, okay.
I want one of those high seaters...

248
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:08,211
with lots of spikes
and a big stowage compartment.

249
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,297
Absolutely. You got it, sir.

250
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,258
Dad, this is actually a little more
important than building saddles.

251
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:17,512
Lesson two. No task is too small
when it comes to serving your people.

252
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,265
Excuse us, Grump.
Dad, can we just talk...

253
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,600
Grump!

254
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,685
You let the forge die down again!

255
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,611
That's it, Grump.
You're going up for adoption.

256
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,238
There you go. Go on. Have away.

257
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:39,951
Seriously, I really need to tell you
about this new land we came across.

258
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,787
Another one?
Any new dragons?

259
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,789
We didn't stick around to find out.

260
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,917
These folks weren't particularly friendly.

261
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,838
Really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder
didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?

262
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,507
No, this was different.

263
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,802
Not the standard run-for-the-hills
hoo-ha I've come to enjoy.

264
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,471
These guys were trappers.

265
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,473
Dragon trappers.

266
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,724
You should have seen their fort.

267
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:07,187
All blown apart and stuck in giant
spikes of ice. Lt was weird!

268
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,272
I've never seen anything like it.

269
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,483
And worst of all, they thought we did it!

270
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,862
You two are gonna get yourselves
in serious trouble one of these days.

271
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,698
Not everyone
appreciates this way of life.

272
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,492
Aye, Gobber's right, son.

273
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,910
Best we keep to our own.

274
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,080
Besides, you'll have
more important uses for your time.

275
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,751
Once we make the big announcement!

276
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,171
They are building a dragon army.

277
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,467
Or at least the guy they work for is.

278
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,637
Dargo Bloody Fist, or something.

279
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,601
I'll bloody his fist with my face
if he tries to take my dragon!

280
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:47,769
Or mine!

281
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,437
You're such a moron.

282
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,689
A beautiful moron.

283
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:51,898
Yeah.

284
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,402
Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?

285
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,237
Yeah. Wait.

286
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,905
You know him?

287
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,909
Ground all dragons!

288
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:03,952
What? Why?

289
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,412
Seal the gates!

290
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,415
Lower the storm doors!
Wait! What is happening?

291
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,291
Come on!

292
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,876
You heard the man! Lock it down.

293
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,632
No dragon or Viking sets foot
off this island until I give the word!

294
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,040
Wait, because some guy you knew
is stirring up trouble...

295
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,636
in some faraway land?

296
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,972
Because Drago Bludvist is a madman...

297
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,308
without conscience or mercy.

298
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:31,021
And if he's built a dragon army,
gods help us all.

299
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,856
Get them into their pens! Quickly!

300
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,858
Then, let's ride back out there.

301
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:38,361
We'll follow those trappers to Drago
and talk some sense into him.

302
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,322
No. We fortify the island.

303
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,032
It's our duty to keep the peace!

304
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,577
Peace is over, Hiccup.
I must prepare you for war.

305
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,786
War?

306
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,456
Dad, if Drago is coming for our dragons...

307
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,000
we can't wait around for him to get here.

308
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,211
Let's go find him and change his mind.

309
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,422
No, some minds won't be changed, Hiccup.

310
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,841
Berk is what you need to worry about.

311
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,385
A chief protects his own.

312
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,348
Secure the stables!
Latch every stall!

313
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,433
Hiccup, don't!
I have to.

314
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,643
This way!

315
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,977
Quickly!

316
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,272
Hiccup!

317
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,067
Come on!

318
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,403
Hiccup!

319
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,916
Keep your eyes peeled, lads!

320
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,794
With this wind,
we'll reach Drago by daybreak...

321
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:39,506
so best we fill this ship up
with dragons, and quick!

322
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,216
It's no time to be picky.

323
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,010
Eret?
Not if we want to keep our...

324
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,431
heads! Off the port quarter!

325
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,809
Net them, lads!
Take them down!

326
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,398
You're not getting away this time.

327
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,941
Fire!

328
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,610
Reload!

329
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,445
Reload! Incoming!

330
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,199
And here I was...

331
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,535
worried we might turn up empty-handed.

332
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:12,247
Nope. It's your lucky day.
We give up.

333
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,752
That's one Night Fury,
one Deadly Nadder...

334
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,922
and two of the finest dragon riders
west of Luk Tuk.

335
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,383
That ought to make the boss happy, right?

336
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,260
Excuse us.

337
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,428
What are you doing?

338
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,430
Toothless, stay.

339
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:34,102
The dragons don't care for cramped spaces,
so they'll just hang out with you.

340
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,062
They won't be any trouble.

341
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,024
Unless you do that.

342
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:43,194
You know, wooden boat, big ocean.
How is your swimming?

343
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,738
Not good.

344
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,118
Almost forgot.
You can't have armed prisoners.

345
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,870
How is this a plan?

346
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,706
Just what every dragon trapper needs.

347
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:58,084
One end coats the blade
in Monstrous Nightmare saliva.

348
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,962
The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas.

349
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,798
All it takes is a spark, and...

350
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,427
Yeah, there you go.

351
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,512
Once they see you as one of their own...

352
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,890
even the testiest dragons can be trained.

353
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:12,724
Right, bud?

354
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,142
Give me that!

355
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,021
What game are you playing?

356
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,357
No game. We just wanna meet Drago.
Why?

357
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,402
Because I'm going to change his mind
about dragons.

358
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,949
He can be really persuasive.

359
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,451
Once you've earned his loyalty...

360
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,120
there is nothing
a dragon won't do for you.

361
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,290
You won't be changing
any minds around here.

362
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,833
I can change yours.

363
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,919
Right here. Right now.

364
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,048
May I?

365
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,346
Dragon riders!

366
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,354
Put me down!

367
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,898
Snotlout, what are you doing?

368
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,483
See how well I protect and provide?

369
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:05,944
What is with all the nets?

370
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,612
Hey, watch it! That was...

371
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,198
close.

372
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,245
Oh, my.

373
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,250
Me likey.

374
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,213
Take me.

375
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,385
Hold your fire!

376
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,933
What are you guys doing here?

377
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,144
We're here to rescue you!

378
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,854
I don't need to be rescued!

379
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,313
Enough!

380
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,069
Well, didn't you just
pick the wrong ship?

381
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,822
I am Eret, son of Eret.

382
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,162
Get this thing off me.

383
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,746
Anyone else?

384
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,790
That's what I figured.

385
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,918
You, saddle up. We're going home.

386
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,128
No.

387
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,839
Of all the irresponsible...

388
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm trying to protect our dragons
and stop a war!

389
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,260
How is that irresponsible?

390
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,804
Because war is what he wants, son!

391
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,438
Years ago, there was
a great gathering of chieftains...

392
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,357
to discuss the dragon scourge
we all faced.

393
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,820
Into our midst
came a stranger from a strange land...

394
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:34,866
covered in scars
and draped in a cloak of dragon skin.

395
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,827
He carried no weapon...

396
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,413
and spoke softly,
saying that he...

397
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,626
Drago Bludvist,
was a man of the people...

398
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,796
devoted to freeing mankind
from the tyranny of dragons.

399
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,591
He claimed that he alone
could control the dragons...

400
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,094
and that he alone could keep us safe...

401
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,388
if we chose to bow down...

402
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,807
and follow him.

403
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,437
Stupid.
Good one.

404
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,689
Aye, we laughed, too.

405
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,609
Until he wrapped himself in his cloak
and cried out...

406
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,487
Then see how well you do without me!

407
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,199
The rooftop suddenly burst into flames...

408
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,786
and from it, armored dragons descended...

409
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,247
burning the hall to the ground.

410
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,670
I was the only one to escape.

411
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,178
Men who kill without reason
cannot be reasoned with.

412
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,013
Maybe.
Hiccup!

413
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,682
I'm still going to try.

414
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,769
This is what I'm good at.

415
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,605
And if I could change your mind...

416
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,482
I can change his, too.

417
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,193
Come on.

418
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,696
Let's go.
No!

419
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,864
Lead the others back to Berk.

420
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,158
I've had enough mutiny for one day.

421
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,205
I like that.

422
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,373
Ruffnut!

423
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,083
Okay!

424
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:29,355
Don't worry, bud.

425
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,191
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

426
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,569
I promise.

427
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,828
Come on, Dad!

428
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,288
Really?

429
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,131
Okay.

430
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,633
No sudden moves.

431
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,284
Hold on. Hold on.

432
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,506
Toothless!

433
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,100
Hey! You left my dragon back there!

434
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,602
He can't fly on his own! He will drown!

435
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,625
Hey!

436
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,795
We have to head back for my dragon!

437
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,426
Who are you?

438
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,012
The dragon thief?

439
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,974
Drago Bludvist?

440
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,895
Do you even understand what I'm saying?

441
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,905
Toothless!
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

442
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,032
I'm glad to see you, too, bud.

443
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,660
You really had me worried, there.

444
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,623
Hiccup?

445
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,130
Could it be?

446
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,550
After all these years?

447
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,635
How is this possible?

448
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,598
Should I know you?

449
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,560
No, you were only a babe.

450
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,152
But a mother never forgets.

451
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,119
Come.

452
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,581
Boar-headed! Just like his mother!

453
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,583
Aye, she could never stay put either.

454
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,043
He's just twenty.

455
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,837
And a Viking.
Could there be a worse combination?

456
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:49,884
When I think of how stubborn
and senseless you were back in the day...

457
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,930
Well, not much has changed, actually.

458
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,061
You know what he's like.
He won't give up, Gobber.

459
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,982
And if Hiccup finds Drago,
before we find him...

460
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,692
Nothing can hurt Hiccup...

461
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,237
so long as that Night Fury's around.
It's a Night Fury!

462
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,550
Find them, Skullcrusher.

463
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,637
Find them.

464
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,688
Hold on. Wait just a minute.

465
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,975
This way!
Come back here!

466
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:45,773
Come.

467
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,151
You can't just say something like that
and run off!

468
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,696
You're my mother?
I mean, what the...

469
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,156
Do you grasp how insane it sounds?

470
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,324
Come, quickly!

471
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,118
I have questions!

472
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,496
Where have you been all this time?

473
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,708
What have you been doing?

474
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,669
But they said you were dead!

475
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,964
Everyone thinks you were eaten by...

476
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,965
This is where you've been
for 20 years?

477
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,928
You've been rescuing them.

478
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,600
Unbelievable.

479
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,268
You're not upset?

480
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,687
What? No.
I don't know.

481
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,023
It's a bit much to get my
head around, to be frank.

482
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,733
It's not every day you find out...

483
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:15,988
your mother is some kind of crazy,
feral, vigilante dragon lady.

484
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:23,370
At least I'm not boring, right?

485
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:28,209
I suppose
there is that one specific thing.

486
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,419
Do you like it?

487
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,507
I don't have the words.

488
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,975
Can I...

489
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,311
He's beautiful.

490
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,025
Incredible!

491
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,154
He might very well
be the last of his kind.

492
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,032
And look, he's your age.

493
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,160
Wow.
No wonder you get along so well.

494
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,291
And retractable teeth!

495
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,295
How did you manage to...
I found him in the woods.

496
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,590
He was shot down and wounded.

497
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:25,683
This Snafflefang lost his leg
to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.

498
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,228
This Raincutter had her wing sliced
by razor netting.

499
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,689
And this poor Hobblegrunt...

500
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,817
was blinded by a tree snare...

501
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,862
and then left to die alone and scared.

502
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:39,989
And what of this?

503
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,033
Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?

504
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,578
Yeah...

505
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,248
The crazy thing is...

506
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,586
I'm actually the one who shot him down.

507
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,130
Hey, it's okay, though.

508
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:57,423
He got me back!

509
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:58,841
Right, bud?

510
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,718
You couldn't save all of me, could you?

511
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,386
You just had to make it even.

512
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,306
So, peg leg!

513
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,273
What did your father think
of your Night Fury friend?

514
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,650
He didn't take it all that well.

515
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,029
But then he changed.

516
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:22,531
They all did.

517
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,492
Pretty soon, everyone back
home had dragons of their own.

518
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,454
If only it were possible.
No, really.

519
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,789
Believe me, I tried, as well...

520
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,918
but people are not
capable of change, Hiccup.

521
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,464
Some of us were just born different.

522
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,470
Hoist the torches!

523
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,974
Berk was a land of kill-or-be-killed...

524
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,977
but I believed peace was possible.

525
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,689
Stop! You'll only make it worse!

526
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,443
It was a very unpopular opinion.

527
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,737
Hiccup!

528
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:06,408
Then, one night,
a dragon broke into our house...

529
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,494
finding you in the cradle.

530
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,289
I rushed to protect you.

531
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,963
But what I saw...

532
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,298
was proof of everything I believed.

533
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,647
This wasn't a vicious beast...

534
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,733
but an intelligent, gentle creature...

535
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,485
whose soul...

536
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,320
reflected my own.

537
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,532
Valka, run!

538
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,867
No! Don't!

539
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,206
Hold on!

540
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,210
No! Stoick!

541
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,753
Valka!

542
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,132
Stoick!

543
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,343
Valka.

544
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:11,598
You and your father
nearly died that night...

545
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,685
all because I couldn't kill a dragon.

546
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,896
It runs in the family.

547
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,482
It broke my heart to stay away...

548
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,527
but I believed
you would be safer if I did.

549
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,572
How did you survive?

550
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,658
Cloudjumper never meant to harm me.

551
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,037
He must have thought
I belonged here.

552
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,916
In the home of the great Bewilderbeast.

553
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,419
The alpha species.

554
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,714
One of the very few that still exist.

555
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,718
Every nest has its queen...

556
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,805
but this is the king of all dragons.

557
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,560
With his icy breath,
this graceful giant built our nest.

558
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,605
A safe haven for dragons everywhere.

559
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,608
Wait, that's the ice-spitter?

560
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,943
He's responsible for all that destruction?

561
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,945
He protects us.

562
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:11,116
We all live under his care
and his command.

563
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,580
All but the babies, of course...

564
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,709
who listen to no one!

565
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,517
I've lived among them...

566
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,143
for 20 years, Hiccup...

567
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,478
discovering their secrets.

568
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,776
He likes you.
Wow.

569
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,362
You must be hungry.

570
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,449
Yeah, I could eat.
Good. It's feeding time.

571
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,043
I don't like it.

572
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,753
They should have been back
with Hiccup by now.

573
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,964
I don't like it either.
Eret, son of Eret...

574
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,300
was the man of my dreams. My everything!

575
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,761
But, baby, I grew facial hair for you.

576
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,429
Me, too.

577
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,390
What if Drago shot them down?

578
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,851
What if they need our help?

579
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,769
We have to find them.

580
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,312
Wait, what?
No, but Stoick said...

581
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,732
Lt doesn't matter what he said,
if they have all been captured.

582
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
Come on!

583
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,697
Do we go back?

584
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,825
We have nowhere to go,
nothing to sell...

585
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,785
and no heads to call our own!

586
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,997
If we don't turn up with dragons,
and fast...

587
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,792
Careful what you wish for!

588
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,211
Eret, son of Eret!

589
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:47,713
What is this?

590
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,714
A kidnapping.

591
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,633
Yay! Can he ride with me?
Can he? Can he?

592
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,845
You're gonna show us the way to Drago.

593
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:59,183
And help dragon riders sneak
into Drago's camp? Just kill me now.

594
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,894
That could be arranged.
Stormfly, drop it!

595
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,898
Good girl!

596
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,275
Stormfly, fetch!

597
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,069
All right!

598
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,947
Okay! I'll take you to Drago!

599
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,785
Works every time.

600
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,337
Hey, I thought we were going to eat.

601
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,880
We are.

602
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,038
Then, from Dragon Island...

603
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,248
I found this archipelago.

604
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,965
There.

605
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,144
When I'm up here...

606
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:10,564
I don't even feel the cold. I just feel...

607
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,274
Free.

608
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:20,574
This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup.

609
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,952
It's all well and good
to call yourself a dragon...

610
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,287
but can you fly?

611
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,018
Oh, no!

612
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,572
Man! Almost!

613
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,825
We just about had it that time!

614
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,790
Incredible.

615
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,709
Well, not bad yourself.

616
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:25,555
All this time, you took after me.

617
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,351
And where was I?

618
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,730
I'm so sorry, Hiccup.

619
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,566
Can we start over?

620
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,988
Will you give me another chance?

621
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:49,788
I can teach you all that I have learned
these past 20 years.

622
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,039
Like...

623
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,129
Wow.

624
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,798
Now you can make those tight turns.

625
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,386
Did you know about this?

626
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,348
Every dragon has its secrets.

627
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,059
And I'll show them all to you.

628
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,811
We'll unlock every mystery...

629
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,897
find every last
species together...

630
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,566
as mother and son.

631
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:27,075
This gift we share, Hiccup, it bonds us.

632
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:31,037
This is who you are, son.

633
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,747
Who we are.

634
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,585
We will change the world
for all dragons.

635
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,504
We will make it a better, safer place.

636
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,298
Yeah.

637
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,550
That sounds amazing.

638
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,689
This is so great!

639
00:46:57,857 --> 00:47:00,567
Now you and I can
go talk to Drago together.

640
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:01,902
What?

641
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,279
There's no talking to Drago.

642
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,697
But we have to...
No.

643
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,532
We must protect our own.

644
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,702
Come on, we should be getting back.

645
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,054
Okay! Look, I got you here.
Now get this thing off me.

646
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,097
Never take a toy from a dragon.

647
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,849
Don't you know anything?

648
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,561
Why does this keep happening to me?

649
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,494
What's down there?

650
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,207
Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs...

651
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,501
cold water deep dweller.

652
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:03,171
I'm thinking class five leviathan,
maybe six.

653
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,646
Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?

654
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,374
Drago!

655
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,504
Get off me!

656
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,009
Always great to see you, my friend!

657
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,802
Keeping warm up here?

658
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:58,727
As you can see, I'm right on time
with a new batch of dragons...

659
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,061
just like I promised.

660
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,896
He's waking up!

661
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,273
Give me some backup, here!

662
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,318
Drop the ropes!

663
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:40,935
Hookfang!
Hey!

664
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,437
What are you doing?

665
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:46,441
You belong to me now.

666
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,778
And as an added bonus...

667
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,613
I also caught you their riders.

668
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,115
No extra charge.
What?

669
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,659
Are you kidding me?

670
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,619
But you were so perfect!

671
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:00,163
Turns out, there is a whole
bunch of them out there.

672
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:03,792
How many?

673
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,710
Drago doesn't have them after all.

674
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,754
How many?
Hundreds.

675
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,381
A whole island full!

676
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,383
I wouldn't worry about it.

677
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,678
My men are hunting them down
as we speak.

678
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,681
They won't know where you're hiding,
I promise you that.

679
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,891
Yes, they will.
They know we're missing...

680
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,018
and they have tracking dragons.

681
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,604
If you so much as touch us,
Hiccup is gonna kick...

682
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,564
Hiccup?
He's not a problem.

683
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,650
Really. Trust me.

684
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:32,904
He's only the son of Stoick the Vast,
his heir to the throne of Berk...

685
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,574
and the greatest dragon master
this world has ever seen!

686
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,618
Dragon master?

687
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:42,163
I alone control the dragons!

688
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,165
No.
Sorry.

689
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,627
And unless you let us go, right now...

690
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,052
he will blast through here
on his Night Fury...

691
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:54,092
and blow your entire fleet of ships
to splinters.

692
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,344
Then they will be crying like babies.

693
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,596
Funny and beautiful.
Good one, babe!

694
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,224
Like babies, they always cry.

695
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,934
Real tiny ones.

696
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:07,605
First, there was one rider,
and now, all of Berk.

697
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,483
And you led them to me!

698
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:13,069
Drago!

699
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,780
Stop all preparations!

700
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:20,034
We must attack the dragon riders' nest
at once!

701
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,830
We will take down their alpha!

702
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:27,459
Then we will take Berk!

703
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,170
Drago.

704
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,796
And get rid of him.

705
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,591
Drago, please, I...

706
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,014
Stormfly!

707
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,603
No!

708
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:03,620
Well, bud, we can't wait around
for Drago to attack this place.

709
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,371
We've gotta find him first.

710
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,047
Let's go.

711
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,550
Easy now.

712
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,552
Are you kidding me?
How did you get in here?

713
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,160
The same way we are getting you out.

714
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:21,888
We?

715
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:22,847
All clear.

716
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,057
Toothless, come.

717
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:27,185
Wait. There's something
you need to know.

718
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,593
Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

719
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,523
This isn't an on-the-way
kind of update, actually.

720
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,732
I've heard enough.

721
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,527
More of the
earth-shattering-development variety.

722
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,779
Yeah, just add it to the pile.

723
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:43,493
Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you,
this is one you'll like.

724
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:44,410
I promise.

725
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,579
You just have to handle it delicately.

726
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,628
You might want to take this one.

727
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,048
Oh, boy.

728
00:52:58,926 --> 00:52:59,926
Dad...

729
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,428
could you put the sword away, please?

730
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,402
I know what you're gonna say, Stoick.

731
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,321
How could I have done this?

732
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,283
Stayed away all of these years?

733
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,368
And why did I not come back to you?

734
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,078
To our son?

735
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:32,375
What sign did I have
that you could change, Stoick?

736
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,544
That anyone on Berk could?

737
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,715
I pleaded so many times
to stop the fighting...

738
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:41,384
to find another answer,
but did any of you listen?

739
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,386
This is why I never married.

740
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,180
This and one other reason.

741
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,518
I know that I left you
to raise Hiccup alone...

742
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:53,354
but I thought
he would be better off without me.

743
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,900
And I was wrong, I see that now, but...

744
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,112
Stop being so stoic, Stoick!

745
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,488
Go on.

746
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,533
Shout, scream, say something!

747
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:13,708
You're as beautiful
as the day I lost you.

748
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,202
Could this day get any worse?

749
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,370
Let me see.

750
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,289
We're gonna jump into freezing cold water,
and then die from drowning.

751
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,874
Looks refreshing.

752
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,085
Please, ladies first.

753
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,172
You are a steaming heap of dragon...

754
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,340
Duck.

755
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,136
Warn the others!

756
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,846
Get them, you son of an Eret.

757
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,058
Take that!

758
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,525
Okay, I love you again.

759
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,653
Pathetic. You can still jump.

760
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:26,698
So, are we going to save your dragons
and get out of here, or not?

761
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,952
Check every trap.
They're here somewhere.

762
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,504
Meatlug?

763
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,590
Anyone coming?

764
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,838
I don't know.
You just keep doing what you are doing.

765
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,345
Keep cranking.

766
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:09,032
Thank you for saving my life.

767
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,079
Now let me return the favor.

768
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:19,000
Mom, you'd never even recognize it.

769
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:22,462
Where we used to make weapons,
we now build saddles, wing-slings.

770
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,797
We even fix dragon teeth!

771
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,050
You wouldn't believe how much
everything's changed.

772
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,802
Our son has changed Berk for the better.

773
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,596
I think we did well
with this one, Val.

774
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:32,764
Thanks, Dad.

775
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,948
I'm a little out of practice.

776
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,909
Well, you know...

777
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,703
I didn't marry you for your cooking.
I hope not.

778
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,457
Her meatballs could kill
more beasts than a battle-axe.

779
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,293
I've still got a few
knocking around in here.

780
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:05,004
And once you move back in,
with all your dragons...

781
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,298
Drago won't even stand a chance.

782
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,217
Everything will be okay!

783
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:13,096
Slow down, son.
It's a lot to take in.

784
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,306
Gotcha.

785
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,358
I love this one.

786
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,251
Remember our song, Val?

787
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:50,842
I'll swim and sail on savage seas

788
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,931
With ne'er a fear of drowning

789
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:03,688
And gladly ride the waves of life

790
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:09,694
If you will marry me

791
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,532
No scorching sun

792
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,327
Nor freezing cold Will stop...

793
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,873
Will stop me on my journey

794
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,040
Sorry.

795
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:31,716
If you will promise me your heart

796
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,014
And love...

797
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,942
And love me for eternity

798
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,654
My dearest one

799
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,823
My darling dear

800
00:58:55,991 --> 00:59:00,036
Your mighty words astound me

801
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,331
But I've no need of mighty deeds

802
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,751
When I feel your arms around me

803
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,253
But I would bring you rings of gold

804
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,714
I'd even sing you poetry
Oh, would you?

805
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,467
And I would keep you from all harm

806
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:17,303
If you would stay beside me

807
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:20,223
I have no use for rings of gold

808
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,851
I care not for your poetry
I only want your hand to hold

809
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,103
I only want you near me

810
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,772
To love and kiss, to sweetly hold

811
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,316
For the dancing and the dreaming

812
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:34,195
Through all life's sorrows and delights
I'll keep your love inside me

813
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:35,763
I will swim and sail on savage seas

814
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,865
With ne'er a fear of drowning

815
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,992
And gladly ride the waves of life

816
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,161
If you will marry me

817
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,540
I'm still going
Gobber!

818
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,042
I'm done.

819
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:53,422
I thought I would have to die
before we could have that dance again.

820
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,092
No need for drastic measures.

821
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,511
For you, my dear...

822
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,055
anything.

823
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,267
Will you come home, Val?

824
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:08,271
Will you be my wife once again?

825
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,238
We can be a family!
What do you say?

826
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,785
Yes.

827
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:26,872
Great! I'll do the cooking.

828
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,627
Thank Odin you didn't listen to me, son.

829
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,275
We never would have found each other.

830
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,133
Toothless?

831
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,054
What's happening?

832
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:04,118
Oh, no.

833
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,619
Val?

834
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,913
Val! It's all right, it's all right.

835
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,833
We're a team now.
What do you want to do?

836
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,752
We have to save the dragons.

837
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,504
Aye. You got it!
Come on, son.

838
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:41,447
Whatever comes,
keep hitting the mountain.

839
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,617
We need to draw the alpha out.

840
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:55,836
Ready the traps!

841
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:12,686
Surprise!

842
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,313
Yeah!

843
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,481
What?

844
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,530
You really are full of surprises!

845
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:23,864
Let's go!

846
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,826
Dragon riders, coming through!

847
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:29,703
Fire!

848
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:36,335
Yeah!

849
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,509
Cut them down!

850
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,055
Eret, son of Eret!

851
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,860
Up, girl!

852
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,404
Lean left, Eret! That's it!

853
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,281
Look out!

854
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,624
Yeah, baby!

855
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,754
Take them down!

856
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,548
Heads up!

857
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,724
Dragon master.

858
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,226
Welcome aboard, dragon rider!

859
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,061
Thanks, I think.

860
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,563
Where have you been?

861
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,649
You know, catching up with Mom.

862
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:53,913
That's your mother?

863
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,790
Now you know
where I get my dramatic flair.

864
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:05,424
The alpha! Now we have a fight!

865
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,648
Come on, Toothless!

866
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,025
Show them what you got, bud.

867
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:28,614
That a boy!

868
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,129
I've waited a long time for this!

869
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,340
You cannot take our dragons!

870
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,300
They are controlled by the alpha!

871
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:51,303
Then it's a good thing
I brought a challenger.

872
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,703
Another one?

873
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,081
That is a class ten! Class ten!

874
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:23,502
No.

875
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,921
Come on! Take down the alpha!

876
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:46,609
Thank you.

877
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:47,943
For you, my dear...

878
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,361
anything.

879
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,204
Val, do you think you can stop them?

880
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,539
I'll do my best.

881
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:01,915
Come on, Cloudjumper!

882
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,375
You!

883
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,961
I watched you burn!

884
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,589
It takes more than a little fire
to kill me!

885
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,488
Stoick!

886
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:58,180
No!

887
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,703
We have won.

888
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,622
Now, finish her!

889
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,124
No!

890
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,675
Hold on!

891
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:35,843
Skullcrusher, go!

892
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:37,970
Come on, Gobber!

893
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,305
Right behind you, Stoick!

894
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:04,163
Stop!

895
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:14,256
This is the great dragon master?

896
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,092
The son of Stoick the Vast?

897
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,764
What shame he must feel.

898
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:26,393
All of this loss, and for what?

899
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,103
To become unstoppable?

900
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,355
To rule the world?

901
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:34,109
Dragons are kind, amazing creatures...

902
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,111
that can bring people together.

903
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,365
Or tear them apart.

904
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:43,869
You see...

905
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,915
I know what it is to live in fear.

906
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,751
To see my village burned...

907
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:53,295
my family taken.

908
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,548
But even as a boy...

909
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,759
left with nothing...

910
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:03,722
I vowed to rise above
the fear of dragons...

911
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,268
and liberate the people of this world.

912
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,562
Then why a dragon army?

913
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:15,067
You need dragons
to conquer other dragons.

914
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:18,779
Or maybe you need dragons
to conquer people.

915
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:21,740
To control those who follow you...

916
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,909
and to get rid of those who won't.

917
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,622
Clever boy.

918
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,416
The world wants peace.

919
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,753
And we have the answer back on Berk.

920
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,505
Just let me show you.

921
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,507
No!

922
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,094
Let me show you!

923
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,520
What in...

924
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,110
Hiccup!

925
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,153
Come on, Gobber!

926
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,115
Okay, change of plan!

927
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,662
No dragon can resist the alpha's command.

928
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:12,833
So, he who controls the alpha...

929
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,544
controls them all.

930
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:20,632
Toothless?

931
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,640
Toothless, you okay, bud?
What's going on?

932
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,642
Witness true strength.

933
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,898
The strength of will over others.

934
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,321
In the face of it...

935
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,741
you are nothing.

936
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,581
What did he just tell you?

937
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,003
Toothless, come on.

938
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,751
What's the matter with you?

939
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:01,173
No, no, no, no. Come on.

940
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,925
What are you doing? Knock it off.

941
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,385
Stop! Snap out of it!

942
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:13,852
Toothless, no!

943
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,520
Toothless!

944
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,068
Don't!
Hiccup!

945
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,570
Stop!

946
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,697
Son!
Dad!

947
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:26,865
No!

948
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:47,260
No.

949
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:56,770
Dad!

950
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,772
Stoick!

951
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:03,402
Dad.

952
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,904
No, you...

953
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:19,668
No.

954
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,179
No, no, no.

955
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,453
No! Get away from him!

956
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,831
Go on! Get out of here!

957
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,292
Get away!

958
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:05,630
It's not his fault.
You know that.

959
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,013
Good dragons...

960
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,474
under the control of bad people...

961
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:16,641
Wait! Don't go.

962
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,310
Do bad things.

963
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,498
Come on!

964
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,085
Gather the men and meet me at Berk!

965
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,711
Toothless!

966
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:46,671
No, don't.

967
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:14,783
May the Valkyries welcome you...

968
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:18,537
and lead you through
Odin's great battlefield.

969
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:22,040
May they sing your name
with love and fury...

970
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:25,252
so that we might hear it rise
from the depths of Valhalla...

971
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:28,213
and know that you have taken
your rightful place...

972
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,423
at the table of kings.

973
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,553
For a great man has fallen.

974
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,974
A warrior. A chieftain.

975
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,725
A father.

976
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,395
A friend.

977
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,598
I'm sorry, Dad.

978
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:36,323
I'm not the chief
that you wanted me to be.

979
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:40,285
And I'm not the peacekeeper
I thought I was.

980
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:44,664
I don't know...

981
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,305
You came early into this world.

982
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:03,141
You were such a wee thing.

983
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,311
So frail, so fragile.

984
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,314
I feared you wouldn't make it.

985
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,151
But your father...

986
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,362
he never doubted.

987
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:20,659
He always said you would become
the strongest of them all.

988
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,245
And he was right.

989
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:29,542
You have the heart of a chief
and a soul of a dragon.

990
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:33,380
Only you can bring our worlds together.

991
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:38,385
That is who you are, son.

992
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,904
I was so afraid of becoming my dad.

993
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,409
Mostly because I thought I never could.

994
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:06,288
How do you become someone that great?

995
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:10,750
That brave? That selfless?

996
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:17,257
I guess you can only try.

997
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,058
A chief protects his own.

998
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:32,063
We are going back.

999
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,983
With what?

1000
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,110
He took all the dragons.

1001
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,612
Not all of them.

1002
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,167
I don't want to die!

1003
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:53,626
We can't fly these things!

1004
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,128
Yeah, no kidding!

1005
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,802
But won't that Bewilderbeast just
take control of these guys, too?

1006
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,764
They're babies.
They don't listen to anyone.

1007
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,932
Yeah! Just like us!

1008
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,144
This is very dangerous!

1009
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:19,027
Some might suggest
this is poorly conceived.

1010
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,279
It's a good thing that I never listen.

1011
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:26,451
So what is your plan?

1012
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,788
Get Toothless back and kick Drago's...

1013
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,039
Heads up!

1014
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,124
And that thing.

1015
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,317
That's a good boy.

1016
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,366
Watch the furniture!

1017
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,160
Where are you going?

1018
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:28,847
Your chief is dead.

1019
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,348
Stoick?

1020
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:34,018
No one can protect you now.

1021
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,285
No.

1022
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:52,954
He took all the dragons!

1023
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,710
Distract the alpha.
Try to keep his focus off Toothless.

1024
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,044
How?

1025
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,046
Have you forgotten
who you're riding with?

1026
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:05,550
There isn't a dragon alive
that I can't wrangle!

1027
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,052
Except for this one!
Amateur.

1028
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,055
Hey, look. It's Hiccup!

1029
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:18,771
What?

1030
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:34,913
Keep them coming!

1031
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:36,456
Black sheep, baby!

1032
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:48,635
Ten points!

1033
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,430
Oh-oh.

1034
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,526
I'm okay!

1035
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:15,578
You certainly are hard to get rid of,
I'll say that.

1036
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:17,038
Toothless?

1037
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:19,707
Hey...

1038
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,543
it's me, bud.

1039
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,294
It's me.

1040
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:25,296
It's me. I'm right here, bud.

1041
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,549
Come back to me.

1042
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:32,095
He's not yours anymore.

1043
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:34,097
He belongs to the alpha.

1044
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:37,725
But, please, great dragon master...

1045
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,228
try to take him.

1046
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:43,815
He will not miss a second time.

1047
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,984
It wasn't your fault, bud.

1048
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,946
They made you do it.

1049
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,791
You would never hurt him.

1050
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,631
You would never hurt me.

1051
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,845
How are you doing that?

1052
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:17,181
Please. You are my best friend, bud.

1053
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,271
My best friend.

1054
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,528
Atta boy! That's it!

1055
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:32,030
I'm here!

1056
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:33,197
Enough!

1057
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:41,205
Hang on!

1058
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,045
Almost there, buddy.

1059
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,140
Do something!

1060
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:01,184
We need to get those two apart.

1061
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:14,238
We have to block him out, Toothless.

1062
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,407
Do you trust me, bud?

1063
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:20,161
We can do this.

1064
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,747
You and me.

1065
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:24,082
As one.

1066
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:27,919
That's it.

1067
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,421
Now let's try this one more time!

1068
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,217
Take him down, babe!

1069
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:39,013
Go get them!

1070
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,725
Take control of it!

1071
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:46,521
Shut it out, Toothless.

1072
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:47,397
Stop them!

1073
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:48,564
Now!

1074
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:12,964
Not again.

1075
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,968
Toothless! It's now or never!

1076
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,305
Come on, bud!

1077
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,600
Hold on!

1078
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,480
Yeah! We did it!

1079
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,783
Hold him there, Toothless.

1080
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,952
It's all over now.

1081
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:46,164
Or is it?

1082
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:50,585
Oh, no!

1083
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:03,431
No!

1084
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:12,857
Hiccup!

1085
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,223
He's challenging the alpha!

1086
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,016
To protect you.

1087
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,752
No, no, no! No!

1088
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:17,713
Fight back! Fight!

1089
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,257
Fight!

1090
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,011
What's the matter with you?

1091
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,439
Now do you get it?

1092
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:38,943
This is what it is
to earn a dragon's loyalty.

1093
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,738
Let this end. Now.

1094
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:44,448
Never!

1095
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:45,616
Come on!

1096
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:09,974
Fight!

1097
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:46,010
The alpha protects them all.

1098
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,364
You never cease to amaze me, bud.

1099
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,825
Thank you.

1100
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:56,205
Toothless, you know that doesn't wash out!

1101
01:28:58,709 --> 01:29:00,835
I knew you'd come back!

1102
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:04,547
Stormfly!

1103
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:09,927
Give me a cuddle, Grumpy!

1104
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,266
Who's my little princess?

1105
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,184
Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang.

1106
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,770
You are! Yes, you are!
I missed you!

1107
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:21,105
Oh, Barf!

1108
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:22,940
Not you!

1109
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:28,612
That was some pretty fine
dragon wrangling back there.

1110
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,448
You'd make a good trapper.

1111
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:36,370
You know, Skullcrusher's gonna need
somebody to look after him now.

1112
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:38,205
Me?

1113
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,586
I'd be honored.

1114
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:49,759
Your father would be
every bit as proud as I am.

1115
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,385
Thank you.

1116
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:53,429
I'm really glad you're here, Mom.

1117
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,639
And here I'll stay.

1118
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,476
See?

1119
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,269
I told you it was in here.

1120
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:05,483
Still doing that one?
That's hilarious.

1121
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,151
Come here, you.

1122
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,019
The chief has come home!

1123
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:55,199
Long live the chief! Long live the chief!
Long live the chief!

1124
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:22,059
This is Berk.

1125
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:25,229
A bit trampled and busted
and covered in ice...

1126
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,148
but it's home.

1127
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:28,899
It's our home.

1128
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:35,906
Those who attacked us
are relentless and crazy.

1129
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,826
But those who stopped them...

1130
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,328
even more so!

1131
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,916
We may be small in numbers...

1132
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:47,418
but we stand for something...

1133
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:50,838
bigger than anything
the world can pit against us.

1134
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,008
We are the voice of peace.

1135
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:57,261
And, bit by bit,
we will change this world.

1136
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:08,939
You see, we have something they don't.

1137
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,566
Sure, they have armies...

1138
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,736
and they have armadas...

1139
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,197
but we have...

1140
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:19,575
our dragons!

1
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,995
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

2
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,748
I can break through walls,
I just can't...

3
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,917
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

4
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,295
Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:48,299
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

6
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:51,594
Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?

7
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:55,723
Of course I have a secret identity.

8
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,477
Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,813
Who'd want to go shopping
as Elastigirl, know what I mean?

10
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:07,694
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,905
Think it'll strengthen
the relationship or something.

12
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:16,327
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego."

13
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:20,999
I mean, you tell me you're
a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,961
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

15
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,130
No matter how many times
you save the world,

16
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,842
it always manages to get back
in jeopardy again.

17
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,387
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know?

18
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,849
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess.

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,518
"Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,312
I could get to that point.

21
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,273
- "Please?"
- We're not finished.

22
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,693
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

23
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,195
Relax a little and raise a family.

24
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:54,449
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

25
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:57,243
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

26
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:00,705
Leave the saving of the world
to the men? I don't think so.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,082
I don't think so.

28
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,643
Mr. Incredible.

29
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:11,442
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

30
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,407
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

31
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,825
No, he's quite tame.

32
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,881
Let go now.

33
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,150
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

34
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,318
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,779
<i>All units.
We have a tour bus robbery...</i>

36
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,323
Tour bus robbery. I've still got time.

37
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,617
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

38
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,704
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...

39
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,373
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

40
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,041
What? No.

41
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,335
You're that kid from the fan club.

42
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,130
Brophy. Brody.
Buddy! Buddy!

43
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,007
My name is IncrediBoy.

44
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,176
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

45
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,845
signed every scrap of paper
you pushed at me...

46
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,556
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

47
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,601
crime fighting style,
favorite catch phrases, everything!

48
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,394
I'm your number one fan!

49
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,441
Hey! Hey, wait!

50
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,826
You know,

51
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:47,872
you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

52
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,917
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,043
Hey, look...

54
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,883
Elastigirl.

55
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,052
Mr. Incredible.

56
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,597
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,766
- I just took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

58
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,560
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

59
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:12,563
- My job, you mean.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

60
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,774
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

61
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,859
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

62
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,111
Well, whatever happened
to equal treatment?

63
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,781
Look, the lady got me first.

64
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,076
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

65
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,620
Well, I think you need to be more

66
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,747
flexible.

67
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,166
Are you doing anything later?

68
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,627
I have a previous engagement.

69
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,057
Now, you just stay here.

70
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,102
They usually pick up
the garbage in an hour.

71
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,771
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

72
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,275
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

73
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,862
He's gonna jump!

74
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,128
I think
you broke something.

75
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,298
With counseling,
I think you'll come to forgive me.

76
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,174
Wait a minute.

77
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,831
Bomb Voyage.

78
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,377
And IncrediBoy!

79
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,087
IncrediBoy?

80
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:05,009
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

81
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,677
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

82
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,305
Can we talk?

83
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,515
You always say be true to yourself,

84
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,393
but you never say
which part to be true to.

85
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:19,273
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward. IncrediBoy!

86
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:22,401
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

87
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:24,695
This is because I don't have powers,
isn't it?

88
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,864
Not every superhero has powers,
you know.

89
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,741
You can be super without them.

90
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,286
I invented these.
I can fly. Can you fly?

91
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,622
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

92
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,835
Just give me one chance!
I'll show you. I'll go get the police.

93
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,171
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second, really.

94
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,548
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

95
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,761
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

96
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,722
- I can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...

97
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,017
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

98
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,940
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

99
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,942
I can help you.
You're making a mist...

100
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:47,111
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

101
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:48,154
They picked him up.

102
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,656
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

103
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,283
who I caught robbing the vault.

104
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,952
We might nab him
if we set up a perimeter.

105
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,954
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

106
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,290
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

107
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,960
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

108
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,212
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

109
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,799
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

110
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:12,970
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

111
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,687
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

112
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:25,149
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

113
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,153
Showtime.

114
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:36,994
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

115
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,164
You're late. When you asked
if I was doing anything later,

116
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:43,542
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

117
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,003
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

118
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,631
You need to be more flexible.

119
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,092
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

120
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,344
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

121
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,513
You know that. Don't you?

122
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,057
- ...so long as you both shall live?
- I do.

123
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,018
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

124
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,358
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

125
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,570
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

126
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:17,701
<i>In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued</i>

127
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,205
<i>for saving someone who,
apparently, didn't want to be saved.</i>

128
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,915
<i>The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,</i>

129
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:26,460
<i>who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,</i>

130
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:30,548
<i>has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.</i>

131
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,009
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

132
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,054
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions,"

133
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,473
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

134
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,851
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

135
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,602
My client has no comment.

136
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:48,357
<i>Another suit was filed
by victims of the El train accident.</i>

137
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,527
<i>Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.</i>

138
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:55,948
<i>And opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.</i>

139
00:10:56,031 --> 00:11:00,995
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

140
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,081
Time for them to join us, or go away.

141
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,084
<i>Under public pressure,
and the financial burden</i>

142
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:09,628
<i>of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,</i>

143
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:13,757
<i>the government quietly initiated
the Superhero Relocation Program.</i>

144
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,303
<i>The supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions,</i>

145
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:21,765
<i>in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work.</i>

146
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,517
<i>Where are they now?</i>

147
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:27,897
<i>They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.</i>

148
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:33,277
<i>Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.</i>

149
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,239
Denied? You're denying my claim?

150
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,910
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

151
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

152
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,663
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

153
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,626
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

154
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,461
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

155
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,130
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

156
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,507
We're now officially moved in.

157
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,384
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

158
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:59,803
The last three years
don't count because...

159
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,974
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

160
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,476
<i>Why do we have
so much junk?</i>

161
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,019
Listen, I've got a client.

162
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,189
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

163
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,566
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

164
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,569
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

165
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:20,199
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

166
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,326
I don't know what I'll do.

167
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,420
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

168
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:37,174
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

169
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,177
Norma Wilcox.
W-I-L-C-O-X.

170
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,513
On the third floor. But I can't.

171
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,684
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

172
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,686
with our legal department
on the second floor.

173
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,022
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

174
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,483
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

175
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,859
Oh, thank you, young man.

176
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,696
Sorry.
I know you're upset!

177
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,281
Pretend to be upset.

178
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,203
Parr!

179
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,706
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

180
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,874
Someone broke
into their house, Mr. Huph.

181
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,044
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

182
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,965
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

183
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,259
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

184
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,722
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

185
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,893
<i>Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.</i>

186
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,483
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

187
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,904
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

188
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:45,159
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

189
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,619
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

190
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,748
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

191
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,625
Well... Not really. No.

192
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,835
Actually, not.

193
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,962
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

194
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:59,590
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

195
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,474
See? You see?

196
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,184
You don't see it?

197
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,772
He moves! Right there!

198
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:18,275
Wait, wait! Right there!

199
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,985
Right as I'm sitting down!

200
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,779
I don't know how he does it,

201
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,114
but there's no tack before he moves

202
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,327
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

203
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,291
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

204
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,460
This little rat is guilty!

205
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,964
You and your son can go now,
Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble.

206
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,009
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

207
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,721
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

208
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:56,230
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

209
00:14:56,313 --> 00:15:00,818
We need to find a better outlet.
A more constructive outlet.

210
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,737
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

211
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,989
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

212
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:10,577
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

213
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,538
Dashiell Robert Parr,

214
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:16,166
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

215
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,335
The last thing you need is temptation.

216
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,839
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

217
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,133
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

218
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,844
Right now, honey,
the world just wants us to fit in,

219
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,471
and to fit in, we just gotta be
like everybody else.

220
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,433
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

221
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:36,103
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

222
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,814
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

223
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,868
Rydinger, where you headed?

224
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,456
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

225
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,293
- "Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?"
- That's kind of funny.

226
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,087
"Hey, Tony, do you play football?"

227
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,259
Tony, I thought we were
gonna go swimming.

228
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,637
He looked at me.

229
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,558
Come on, Violet!

230
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,043
Darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

231
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,463
Oh, great.

232
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,376
Mom.

233
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,297
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

234
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,800
You make weird faces, honey.

235
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,303
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

236
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,431
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

237
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,601
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat?

238
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,982
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

239
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,150
Well, we dissected a frog.

240
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,819
Dash got sent to the office again.

241
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,488
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

242
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,700
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

243
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,493
- What? What for?
- Nothing.

244
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,329
He put a tack on the teacher's chair,
during class.

245
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,457
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

246
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,711
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it? Whoa!

247
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,297
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

248
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,715
We are not encouraging this.

249
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,050
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

250
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,844
Honey!

251
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,141
Great. First the car,
now I gotta pay to fix the table...

252
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,892
What happened to the car?

253
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,938
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

254
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,150
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

255
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,028
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

256
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,740
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

257
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,784
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

258
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,579
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

259
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,624
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

260
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,376
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

261
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,713
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

262
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,425
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.

263
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,218
That's it!

264
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,511
Stop it!

265
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,058
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

266
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,060
Sit down!

267
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,688
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

268
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,358
You sit down! You sit down!

269
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,776
Violet!

270
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,659
"Simon J. Paladino,

271
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:23,580
"longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing"?

272
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:28,418
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

273
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,837
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

274
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,924
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

275
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,801
Okay. I'm intervening!

276
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,513
Violet, let go of your brother.

277
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,431
Hello?

278
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,059
Get the door.

279
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,938
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

280
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,608
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

281
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,652
Lucius!

282
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,778
Whoa!

283
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,408
- Ha, ha.
- Oh!

284
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,077
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

285
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,705
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

286
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:08,083
Bowling night.
Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

287
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,836
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

288
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:18,093
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

289
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,220
Your father and I
are still gonna discuss it.

290
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,098
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

291
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,058
Other kids don't have superpowers.

292
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:29,187
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

293
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,648
What does anyone
in this family know about normal?

294
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,527
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

295
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,489
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

296
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,784
Lucky.

297
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,328
I meant about being normal.

298
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,750
So now I'm in deep trouble.

299
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,128
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

300
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,673
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

301
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,301
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

302
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:03,346
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him.

303
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:07,684
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

304
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,019
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

305
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,439
I mean, the guy has me
on a platter, and he won't shut up.

306
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,816
<i>Municiberg, we have a 23-56...</i>

307
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,401
23-56, what is that?

308
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,445
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

309
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,697
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

310
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,033
Tell you the truth,
I'd rather go bowling.

311
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,621
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

312
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,247
Just to shake things up.

313
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:34,002
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

314
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,421
They're just talking.

315
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,633
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

316
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,010
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

317
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:45,680
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

318
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,184
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

319
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:52,521
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

320
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,149
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

321
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,443
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

322
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,321
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

323
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,866
<i>- We have a report on a fire...</i>
- A fire. We're close!

324
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,577
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

325
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,999
Fire! Yeah!

326
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,260
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah.

327
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:28,098
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

328
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,434
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

329
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,645
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

330
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,064
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

331
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,525
You can't run out.
You can use water in the air.

332
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:42,404
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

333
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,407
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

334
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,618
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

335
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,000
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

336
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,014
Yeah.

337
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,144
Uh-oh.

338
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,812
Oh, good.

339
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,482
That ain't right.

340
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,322
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

341
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,907
Freeze!

342
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,829
Freeze!

343
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:35,749
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

344
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,668
I'm just getting a drink.

345
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:47,677
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

346
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,265
Police officers!

347
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,154
That was way too close.

348
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,907
We are not doing that again.

349
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,496
<i>Verify you want
to switch targets? Over.</i>

350
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:18,041
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

351
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,404
- I thought you'd be back by 11:00.
- I said I'd be back later.

352
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,156
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all,

353
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,244
- you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

354
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,919
Is this rubble?

355
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:06,423
It was just
a little workout. Just to stay loose.

356
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:10,176
You know how I feel about that.
Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

357
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,095
The building was coming down anyway.

358
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,388
What?

359
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,056
You knocked down a building?

360
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:18,143
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

361
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,603
Have you been listening
to the police scanner again?

362
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,773
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

363
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,275
It is a bad thing, Bob!

364
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:29,487
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

365
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:32,449
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen!

366
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,410
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

367
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,955
is what's happening now, Bob.
And you are missing this!

368
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,167
I can't believe you don't want to go to
your own son's graduation.

369
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,295
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

370
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,464
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

371
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,300
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

372
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,302
but if someone is exceptional...

373
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,637
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

374
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,557
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

375
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,477
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

376
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,021
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

377
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,273
This is not about you!

378
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,904
All right, Dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

379
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,281
Vi? You, too, young lady.

380
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,700
Come on. Come on out.

381
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,079
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

382
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,955
Pretty loud discussion.

383
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:24,667
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

384
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:30,590
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

385
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,218
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

386
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,012
Everything's okay.
Go back to bed. It's late.

387
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,847
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

388
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:41,351
In fact, we should all be in bed.

389
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:59,160
<i>Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...</i>

390
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,454
<i>Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?</i>

391
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,541
<i>Mr. Huph would like to talk
to you in his office.</i>

392
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,709
- Now?
<i>- Now.</i>

393
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,479
Sit down, Bob.

394
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:36,197
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

395
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,868
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

396
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,744
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

397
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,454
Why are you unhappy?

398
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,373
Your customers make me unhappy.

399
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,167
What, you've gotten complaints?

400
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,751
Complaints I can handle.

401
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:52,422
What I can't handle is your customers'
inexplicable knowledge

402
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:56,467
of Insuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

403
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,596
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

404
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,182
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

405
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:05,018
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

406
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:09,397
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

407
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,775
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

408
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,736
Starting with our stockholders.

409
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,197
Who's helping them out, huh?

410
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:23,620
You know, Bob, a company...

411
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:24,954
Is like an enormous clock.

412
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,042
...is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

413
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:34,422
It only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

414
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:39,677
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

415
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:44,807
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

416
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:47,018
I'm being
metaphorical, Bob.

417
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,604
Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

418
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,439
Bob?

419
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,817
Bob? Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Parr.

420
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,904
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

421
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:01,074
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He is getting mugged!

422
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,701
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

423
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:07,330
Stop right now or you're fired!

424
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:12,001
Close the door.

425
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,089
Get over here, now.

426
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:23,388
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

427
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:28,101
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

428
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,812
You were this close to losing your...

429
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,197
Uh-oh.

<i>Please report to

- How is he?
- He'll live.

432
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,671
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

433
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,881
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

434
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,259
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

435
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,220
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

436
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,514
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

437
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,891
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

438
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:11,477
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

439
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:14,647
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

440
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,400
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

441
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,529
We can't keep doing this. We
appreciate what you did in the old days,

442
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:24,907
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

443
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,457
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

444
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,877
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

445
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,171
I'll make it work. Thanks.

446
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,256
Take care of yourself.

447
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,645
What are you waiting for?

448
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:58,775
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

449
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,194
Me, too, kid.

450
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:25,968
Huh?

451
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,274
"Hold still"?

452
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,693

455
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,627
<i>Rest assured,
your secret is safe with us.</i>

456
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:03,172
<i>My name is Mirage.
We have something in common.</i>

457
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:06,968
<i>According to the government,
neither of us exist.</i>

458
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:11,514
<i>Please pay attention, as this message
is classified and will not be repeated.</i>

459
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,058
<i>I represent a top secret division
of the government,</i>

460
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,352
<i>designing and testing
experimental technology,</i>

461
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:19,689
<i>and we have need
of your unique abilities.</i>

462
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,983
<i>Something happened
at our testing facility.</i>

463
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,526
- Honey!
- Huh? What?

464
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,361
- Dinner's ready.
- Okay.

465
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,030
<i>...it is contained
within an isolated area,</i>

466
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:32,410
<i>it threatens to cause incalculable
damage to itself and our facilities,</i>

467
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:35,246
<i>jeopardizing hundreds
of millions of dollars...</i>

468
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,914
Is someone in there?

469
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:40,251
- It's the TV, trying to watch.
<i>- Because of its sensitive nature...</i>

470
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,671
- Stop. It's time for dinner.
- One minute!

471
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:47,633
<i>If you accept, your payment will be
triple your current annual salary.</i>

472
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:51,554
<i>Call the number on the card.
Voice-matching will ensure security.</i>

473
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:55,516
<i>The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible.
You're still here.</i>

474
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:59,562
<i>You can still do great things. Or</i>

475
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:02,773
<i>you can listen to police scanners.
Your choice.</i>

476
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,859
<i>You have 24 hours to respond.</i>

477
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,527
<i>Think about it.</i>

478
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,526
<i>This message
will self-destruct.</i>

479
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:47,652
Uh-oh.

480
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,422
You are one distracted guy.

481
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,299
Am I? I don't mean to be.

482
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:16,138
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

483
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,893
I just want you to know how much it
means to me that you stay at it anyway.

484
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,604
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

485
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:25,898
- Something's happened.
- What?

486
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,650
- The, uh...
- What?

487
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:30,319
The company is sending me
to, uh, a conference.

488
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:32,613
- A conference?
- Out of town.

489
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,156
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

490
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,828
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

491
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,954
Yes.

492
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:43,165
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

493
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,750
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

494
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:47,962
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

495
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:51,299
<i>Hello?</i>

496
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,342
This is Mr. Incredible.

497
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,177
I'm in.

498
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,563
The Omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot.

499
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:09,066
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

500
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,028
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

501
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:15,698
Let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders.

502
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,869
We lost control. Now it's loose
in the jungle, threatening our facility.

503
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,080
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

504
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,206
How am I going in?

505
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:28,169
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5,000 feet.

506
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,631
Its cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

507
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:34,884
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

508
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:38,888
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

509
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,349
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

510
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,976
You are Mr. Incredible.

511
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,706
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

512
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:09,502
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

513
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,754
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

514
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:15,341
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

515
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,081
Showtime.

516
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,169
Huh?

517
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,714
Hmm.

518
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,189
Uh-oh.

519
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,460
Oh, my back!

520
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,024
Oh!

521
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,698
Surprising. We must bring him back.

522
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:11,619
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

523
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,307
Most important, keep things light.

524
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:37,269
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

525
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:39,897
Am I overdressed?

526
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,566
Actually, you look rather dashing.

527
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,694
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

528
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:48,989
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

529
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:52,868
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who I'm working for.

530
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,913
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

531
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,374
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

532
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:03,087
I was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

533
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,508
With a volcano?
He's attracted to power. So am I.

534
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:11,387
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

535
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:14,640
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

536
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:16,308
Aren't we all?

537
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:19,103
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on Earth.

538
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:22,314
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

539
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:26,652
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

540
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,779
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

541
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,156
Or you'll be late for work.

542
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,659
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

543
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,621
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

544
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,706
All that jazz.

545
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:11,715
<i>You have an appointment?</i>

546
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,675
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

547
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:17,679
<i>- All visitors are required...
- Go check the electric fence.</i>

548
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,765
<i>What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?</i>

549
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,062
<i>My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.
Come, come.</i>

550
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:37,074
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

551
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:41,453
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

552
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:44,373
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

553
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,750
Milan, darling. Milan.

554
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:50,796
Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

555
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,048
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

556
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:55,676
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

557
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:59,680
Feh! I used to design for gods.

558
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:05,894
But perhaps you come with a challenge,
eh? I was surprised to get your call.

559
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:08,272
E, I just need a patch job.

560
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:11,692
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

561
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:16,280
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

562
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,949
Moonlighting hero work?

563
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,909
Must have happened a long time ago.

564
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:23,996
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

565
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,582
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

566
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:30,878
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

567
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:34,089
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

568
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:36,758
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

569
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:39,344
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

570
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:41,889
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

571
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,141
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

572
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:47,102
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

573
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:50,522
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

574
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:53,692
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

575
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:54,985
Heroic!

576
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:58,739
Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

577
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,451
Oh! He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

578
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:03,577
No capes!

579
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:08,790
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

580
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:11,627
<i>Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.</i>

581
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:14,963
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

582
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,508
<i>All was well, another day saved</i>

583
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:21,428
<i>when his cape snagged
on a missile fin.</i>

584
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,805
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

585
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:24,932
Stratogale!

586
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:30,312
<i>April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.</i>

587
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:32,648
You can't generalize
about these things.

588
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:36,026
<i>Meta-Man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.</i>

589
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,947
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

590
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:43,450
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

591
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:45,535
You know I'm retired from hero work.

592
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:48,872
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

593
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:53,335
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

594
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:57,506
Fine.
I will also fix the hobo suit.

595
00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:02,177
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

596
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:17,526
Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

597
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:20,320
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

598
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,244
<i>- How soon can you get here?
- I'll leave tomorrow morning.</i>

599
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,121
<i>- See you there.</i>
- Goodbye.

600
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:34,668
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

601
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,671
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

602
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:39,548
duty calls.

603
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:49,391
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

604
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,979
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

605
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:56,648
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

606
00:46:56,732 --> 00:47:00,902
- So much.
- I love you, too.

607
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,001
<i>This is your automated Captain.</i>

608
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:19,254
<i>Would you care for more mimosa?</i>

609
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:22,507
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

610
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:28,805
<i>Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.</i>

611
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,523
<i>Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.</i>

612
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:06,593
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

613
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:07,969
Thanks.

614
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:10,764
Nice to be back, Mirage.

615
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:40,335
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

616
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:43,839
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

617
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,382
See you there.

618
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:19,332
Edna.

619
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,335
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
<i>- This is Edna.</i>

620
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:25,088
- E? This is Helen.
<i>- Helen who?</i>

621
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:28,425
Helen Parr? You know...

622
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:30,677
Elastigirl?

623
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,973
<i>Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!</i>

624
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,808
It's been a while.

625
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:38,393
There's only one person
Bob would trust

626
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:40,145
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

627
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,230
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

628
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:45,442
Much better than those
horrible pajamas he used to wear.

629
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:48,069
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

630
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,238
<i>- I'm calling about...</i>
- Don't make me beg.

631
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,781
- I won't do it, you know.
<i>- Beg?</i>

632
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:54,493
No, I'm calling about suit.

633
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:57,370
Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

634
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:01,208
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

635
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:15,722
Hmm.

636
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:33,949
It's bigger!

637
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:37,327
It's badder!

638
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,917
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

639
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:47,754
It's finally ready.

640
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:52,175
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

641
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:55,762
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

642
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:59,808
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

643
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:02,978
Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it.

644
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:07,232
I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan.

645
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:11,820
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

646
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,656
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

647
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:18,201
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

648
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:21,538
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

649
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,332
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

650
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:28,169
<i>It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.</i>

651
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:30,171
<i>You can't count on anyone.</i>

652
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,173
Especially your heroes.

653
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:35,552
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

654
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:39,055
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

655
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:40,599
That's the way it works.

656
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:43,435
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

657
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:46,104
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

658
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,815
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

659
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:52,902
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

660
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,782
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

661
00:51:57,866 --> 00:51:59,701
I can't believe it.

662
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:06,916
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

663
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,544
Am I good enough now?

664
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:12,631
Who's super now?

665
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:15,216
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

666
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,470
Oh, brilliant!

667
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:38,907
All right, try this one on for size,
big boy.

668
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,111
Gazerbeam.

669
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:29,457
Kronos?

670
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:59,487
<i>Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.</i>

671
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:07,203
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

672
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:11,541
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

673
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,920
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

674
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:17,839
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

675
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:21,509
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

676
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:25,346
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

677
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:27,724
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

678
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:30,727
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

679
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,896
That is why I show you my work.

680
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:34,689
That is why you are here.

681
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:43,531
Edna Mode.

682
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,284
And guest.

683
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,928
Come. Sit.

684
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:11,643
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

685
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:14,521
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

686
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:18,566
Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

687
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,569
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

688
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:26,574
And can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

689
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:30,745
Completely bulletproof.

690
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:35,708
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

691
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:38,753
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

692
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:42,924
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

693
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:46,219
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

694
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,805
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

695
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,682
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

696
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:56,771
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

697
00:55:56,813 --> 00:56:00,400
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

698
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:03,820
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

699
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:09,284
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

700
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:17,208
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

701
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:19,335
and still retain its shape.

702
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:22,380
Virtually indestructible,

703
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:26,134
yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

704
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:29,804
As an extra feature,
each suit contains a homing device,

705
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:34,142
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

706
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:38,313
Well, darling? What do you think?

707
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:42,901
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

708
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:44,485
Our family is underground.

709
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:47,739
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

710
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:50,366
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

711
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,328
Why would he keep secrets from you?

712
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,039
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

713
00:56:56,664 --> 00:57:00,043
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

714
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:03,588
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

715
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:06,215
Do you know where he is?

716
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:09,218
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

717
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:43,855
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

718
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:50,278
Are you okay?
What happened?

719
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,950
<i>Break surveillance
and engage. Continuing sweep...</i>

720
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:40,221
- <i>Insuricare.</i>
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

721
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:41,848
Bob Parr is my husband.

722
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:45,143
I was wondering if you could give me
the number of the hotel he's staying at?

723
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:49,605
- The number I have is no good.
<i>- Mr. Parr no longer works here.</i>

724
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:52,984
What do you mean? He's on
a business trip. A company retreat.

725
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:56,112
<i>My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.</i>

726
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:29,770
So, you don't know where he is.

727
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,109
Would you like to find out?

728
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:56,524
I am such an idiot.
I let this happen, you know.

729
01:02:57,441 --> 01:03:01,237
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

730
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,198
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

731
01:03:04,282 --> 01:03:08,703
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

732
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:11,205
What are you talking about?

733
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:16,919
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

734
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:19,088
What will you do? Is this a question?

735
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,674
Show him you remember
that he is Mr. Incredible,

736
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:24,719
and you will remind him who you are!

737
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:29,056
Well, you know where he is. Go!
Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

738
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:33,060
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

739
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:35,730
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

740
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:40,151
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

741
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,111
I should be back tonight. Late.

742
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:43,571
You can be in charge that long,
can't you?

743
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:46,866
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

744
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:49,327
Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy.

745
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:53,748
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

746
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:57,626
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

747
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,802
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

748
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:09,013
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

749
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:10,514
We all get cool outfits?

750
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,601
Dash!
You come back here this moment!

751
01:04:16,062 --> 01:04:18,564
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

752
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:21,442
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

753
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:24,445
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

754
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:27,281
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

755
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:31,577
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

756
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:34,455
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

757
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:36,707
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

758
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:40,127
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

759
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,673
What makes you think it's special?

760
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:47,510
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

761
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:59,480
Snug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me.

762
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:03,150
- <i>What do you need?</i>
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

763
01:05:03,234 --> 01:05:05,319
<i>Let me think.</i>

764
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:17,164
Island approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

765
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:18,916
VFR on top. Over.

766
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:24,672
Island tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner

767
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:27,049
requesting vectors to the initial.

768
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:40,020
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

769
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:44,316
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

770
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:49,447
At the same time. Yeah.

771
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:08,215
You, sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible."
I was right to idolize you.

772
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:11,177
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

773
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:15,222
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

774
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:17,725
I'm still geeking out about it!

775
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,563
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.

776
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:27,568
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

777
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:30,070
Lame, lame, lame.

778
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:31,572
All right, who did you contact?

779
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,492
Contact? What are you talking about?

780
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:42,666
I am referring to last night
at 23:07 hours

781
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,920
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

782
01:06:45,961 --> 01:06:48,923
I didn't know about the homing device.

783
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:57,473
And now a government plane
is requesting permission to land here.

784
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:58,557
Who did you contact?

785
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:00,726
I didn't send for a plane.

786
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:02,686
Play the transmission.

787
01:07:03,938 --> 01:07:07,316
<i>- India Golf checking in.</i>
- Helen!

788
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:10,486
So you do know these people.

789
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:13,697
Well, then,
I'll send them a little greeting.

790
01:07:16,534 --> 01:07:18,244
- Ow!
- Violet!

791
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:19,787
It's not my fault.

792
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:21,914
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.

793
01:07:21,956 --> 01:07:23,791
That's not true!

794
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:26,293
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what."

795
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:30,214
- ...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

796
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:33,133
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

797
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:36,345
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

798
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:38,722
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

799
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:41,600
All right, well, who'd you get?

800
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:44,103
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

801
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:47,481
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

802
01:07:47,523 --> 01:07:51,151
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

803
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:53,404
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

804
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:56,365
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

805
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:57,658
- Kari...
<i>- The beauty is</i>

806
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,411
they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

807
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:02,621
I wish my parents played Mozart

808
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:05,666
because half the time I don't know
what anyone's talking about.

809
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:09,378
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

810
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:12,381
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

811
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,466
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

812
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:17,219
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

813
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:20,055
Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.

814
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:22,057
<i>Who can handle it?</i>

815
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:32,318
India Golf niner-niner transmitting
in the blind guard.

816
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,278
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

817
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:06,602
Repeat, disengage.

818
01:09:06,685 --> 01:09:07,895
<i>- Friendlies...</i>
- No!

819
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:09,480
Call off the missiles. I'll do anything.

820
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:12,900
Too late. Fifteen years too late.

821
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:17,780
Friendlies two-zero miles
south-southwest of your position.

822
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:20,199
Angels 10. Track east. Disengage.

823
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,785
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

824
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:24,620
You said not to use our powers.

825
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:27,206
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

826
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:29,291
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

827
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:35,130
Mom?

828
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:36,757
Violet!

829
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,260
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

830
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:41,845
There are children aboard.

831
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:43,639
<i>- There are children aboard!</i>
- No!

832
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:46,934
Put a field around us now!

833
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:48,477
I've never done one that big.

834
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,645
Do it now!

835
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:52,606
Abort, abort, abort!

836
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,527
Abort, abort, abort!

837
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:29,476
Brace yourselves!

838
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:38,819
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

839
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,612
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

840
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:43,240
We're not gonna panic, we're not...
Look out!

841
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:57,171
- Oh, my God! Whose idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

842
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,798
We're dead! We're dead!

843
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,760
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

844
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:04,178
Stop it!

845
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:06,555
We are not gonna die!

846
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,599
Both of you will get a grip.

847
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:11,101
Or so help me
I will ground you for a month!

848
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,686
Understand?

849
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:17,608
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

850
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:19,735
Ah, you'll get over it.

851
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:23,405
I seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone."

852
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,542
Release me. Now!

853
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:37,127
Or what?

854
01:11:37,211 --> 01:11:38,754
I'll crush her.

855
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:41,715
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

856
01:11:41,757 --> 01:11:44,635
It'll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick.

857
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,720
Show me.

858
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,360
I knew you couldn't do it.

859
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:04,196
Even when you have nothing to lose.

860
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:05,739
You're weak.

861
01:12:06,657 --> 01:12:08,534
And I've outgrown you.

862
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:22,214
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

863
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:24,258
That way is our best bet.

864
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:27,094
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?

865
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:31,223
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

866
01:12:31,265 --> 01:12:34,101
I expect you to trust me.

867
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:37,331
What a trooper.

868
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:39,958
I'm so proud of you.

869
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,877
Thanks, Mom.

870
01:13:47,883 --> 01:13:50,427
I think your father is in trouble.

871
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:53,513
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot either.

872
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:55,098
I'm going to look for him.

873
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:58,018
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.

874
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,312
- What?
- You heard her.

875
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:06,318
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

876
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:07,694
Protect it.

877
01:14:07,736 --> 01:14:09,863
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.

878
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:13,158
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!

879
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:17,412
Remember the bad guys

880
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:20,290
on those shows you used to watch
on Saturday mornings?

881
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,877
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

882
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:27,673
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

883
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:31,009
They will kill you if they get the chance.

884
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:33,387
Do not give them that chance.

885
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:35,222
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

886
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:38,433
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

887
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:43,897
Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.

888
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:46,775
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

889
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:50,487
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

890
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:56,076
Mom!

891
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:59,621
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

892
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:02,708
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

893
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:05,085
Shh. It isn't your fault.

894
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:08,755
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you.

895
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:11,383
But things are different now.

896
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:14,469
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

897
01:15:14,803 --> 01:15:16,888
You have more power than you realize.

898
01:15:17,389 --> 01:15:19,725
Don't think. And don't worry.

899
01:15:20,017 --> 01:15:22,310
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

900
01:15:23,437 --> 01:15:24,980
It's in your blood.

901
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:05,645
- He's not weak, you know.
- What?

902
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:08,023
Valuing life is not weakness.

903
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:11,943
Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

904
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:13,695
I had everything under control.

905
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:16,656
And disregarding it is not strength.

906
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:19,493
I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all.

907
01:16:19,618 --> 01:16:22,079
I knew he wouldn't have it in him
to actually...

908
01:16:22,162 --> 01:16:24,915
Next time you gamble, bet your own life!

909
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:41,515
Okay, okay, okay.

910
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,405
A rocket?

911
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:34,836
Hey!

912
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:36,439
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

913
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:38,275
What do you think is going on here?

914
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:40,485
You think we're on vacation?

915
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:43,697
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

916
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,032
Or worse,
their marriage.

917
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:47,909
Their marriage?

918
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:52,706
So, the bad guys are trying to wreck
Mom and Dad's marriage.

919
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:54,958
Forget it. You're so immature.

920
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:58,253
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

921
01:19:58,336 --> 01:20:02,173
I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh.

922
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,047
Cool!

923
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,215
Cool!

924
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:48,678
<i>Roger.
We are ready for launch.</i>

925
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:02,108
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

926
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:16,790
<i>ETA two-niner. Over.</i>

927
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:23,046
<i>TCI clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.</i>

928
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:27,842
<i>Not responding to IFF.</i>

929
01:21:27,926 --> 01:21:29,719
<i>IRCM reads negative.</i>

930
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:32,931
- Bob.
- What?

931
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:34,224
I didn't say anything.

932
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:05,213
<i>Identification, please.</i>

933
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:07,006
Hey!

934
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:10,093
- Hey, Violet! Come here, look. It talks!
- What? What?

935
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:11,678
There. That one.

936
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:13,346
<i>Voice key incorrect.</i>

937
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:15,014
"Voice key"?

938
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,809
<i>Voice key incorrect.</i>

939
01:22:17,851 --> 01:22:19,519
Wait a second.

940
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:23,189
- What do we do?
- Run!

941
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:25,358
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

942
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:33,783
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

943
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:58,183
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

944
01:22:58,224 --> 01:23:00,685
In fact, there's no time at all.

945
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:02,896
- Please...
- Why are you here?

946
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:07,942
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

947
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:11,571
Family survived the crash.

948
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:13,656
They're here on the island!

949
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:15,116
They're alive?

950
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,632
- Helen?
- Hello.

951
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:32,884
You must be Mrs...

952
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:36,095
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

953
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:39,098
That's what I was doing. Let go of me!

954
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:42,268
Let go, you lousy, lying,
unfaithful creep!

955
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:46,231
How could I betray the perfect woman?

956
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:48,107
Oh, you're referring to me now?

957
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:49,400
Where are the kids?

958
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,277
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

959
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:54,739
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

960
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:56,574
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

961
01:23:56,616 --> 01:24:00,203
They stowed away.
You're not striking the proper tone.

962
01:24:08,503 --> 01:24:09,546
Think they're supers?

963
01:24:09,629 --> 01:24:12,090
Dash, remember what Mom said.

964
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:13,633
- What?
- Stop talking!

965
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,886
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

966
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,680
- What?
- Run!

967
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:21,891
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

968
01:24:23,518 --> 01:24:24,811
Show yourself!

969
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:26,873
Hey!

970
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,757
Ha, ha!

971
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,733
I'm alive. Yeah!

972
01:25:55,735 --> 01:25:56,736
Uh-oh.

973
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:09,642
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.

974
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:10,977
But I didn't want you to worry.

975
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,437
You didn't want me to worry?

976
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:15,356
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

977
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,651
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

978
01:27:21,112 --> 01:27:23,990
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

979
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:38,379
You can't hide from me.

980
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:46,804
- There you are.
- Hey!

981
01:27:51,142 --> 01:27:52,769
Don't touch my sister!

982
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:02,779
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!

983
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:04,530
Whatever you do, don't stop!

984
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:23,049
Mom! Dad! Hey!

985
01:28:24,926 --> 01:28:26,010
Kids.

986
01:28:26,052 --> 01:28:27,887
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

987
01:28:27,929 --> 01:28:30,431
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

988
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,284
I love you.

989
01:28:50,368 --> 01:28:51,869
- Wow.
- Whoa.

990
01:29:06,551 --> 01:29:07,927
Time out!

991
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:12,890
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

992
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:17,311
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

993
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:22,149
You married Elastigirl? Whoa!

994
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:25,653
And got busy!

995
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:30,324
It's a whole family of supers.
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

996
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:32,994
Oh, this is just too good!

997
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:36,581
<i>- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...</i>

998
01:29:36,622 --> 01:29:41,627
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

999
01:29:41,711 --> 01:29:45,047
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

1000
01:29:45,131 --> 01:29:47,884
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

1001
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:52,680
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

1002
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:55,641
I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were!

1003
01:29:55,683 --> 01:29:59,854
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

1004
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:02,690
Oh, I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

1005
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:06,819
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

1006
01:30:06,903 --> 01:30:08,112
I'll give them heroics.

1007
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:11,574
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

1008
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:14,827
And when I'm old and I've had my fun,
I'll sell my inventions

1009
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:19,248
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

1010
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:22,168
And when
everyone's super

1011
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:27,006
no one will be.

1012
01:30:52,448 --> 01:30:54,408
Fire at will!

1013
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:04,543
<i>It's overwhelming the tanks.</i>

1014
01:31:04,627 --> 01:31:05,836
I'm sorry.

1015
01:31:06,379 --> 01:31:10,091
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

1016
01:31:10,174 --> 01:31:13,970
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

1017
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:17,014
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

1018
01:31:17,056 --> 01:31:18,224
Shh. Don't interrupt.

1019
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:20,977
So caught up in the past that I...

1020
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:27,024
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

1021
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:29,151
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

1022
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:33,239
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

1023
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:35,992
but I think it's time we wind down now.

1024
01:31:39,245 --> 01:31:40,913
We need to get back to the mainland.

1025
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:43,624
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

1026
01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:54,760
Where are all the guards?

1027
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:56,804
Go, go!

1028
01:32:01,267 --> 01:32:04,103
Hey, every time they run,
you take a shot.

1029
01:32:20,286 --> 01:32:22,455
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

1030
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:25,041
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

1031
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,043
How about a rocket?

1032
01:32:31,172 --> 01:32:34,842
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

1033
01:32:35,426 --> 01:32:37,636
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

1034
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:43,142
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed
the password by now.

1035
01:32:43,184 --> 01:32:45,978
- How do I get into the computer?
<i>- Say please.</i>

1036
01:33:02,161 --> 01:33:03,913
- Honey?
- What?

1037
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:05,831
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

1038
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:09,585
Where is my supersuit?

1039
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:12,755
- I put it away.
- Where?

1040
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:16,175
- Why do you need to know?
- I need it!

1041
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:19,261
Don't you think about
running off doing no derrin'-do.

1042
01:33:19,345 --> 01:33:21,222
We've been planning
this dinner for two months!

1043
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:24,683
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

1044
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:28,270
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

1045
01:33:28,354 --> 01:33:30,523
"Greater good"?
I am your wife!

1046
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:33,526
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

1047
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:38,614
Run!

1048
01:33:40,366 --> 01:33:41,700
My baby!

1049
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:48,749
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?

1050
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:52,086
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1051
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:57,133
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

1052
01:34:00,094 --> 01:34:01,971
All right, stand back.

1053
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:10,104
Someone needs to teach
this hunk of metal a few manners.

1054
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:13,149
Ha, ha!

1055
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:43,637
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

1056
01:34:46,015 --> 01:34:48,100
How you doing, honey?

1057
01:34:48,184 --> 01:34:50,728
Do I have to answer?

1058
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:56,192
Kids, strap yourselves down
like I told you.

1059
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,239
Here we go, honey.

1060
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:03,949
Ready, Violet?

1061
01:35:04,992 --> 01:35:06,952
Ready? Now!

1062
01:35:10,748 --> 01:35:12,291
This is gonna be rough.

1063
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:22,051
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1064
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:23,802
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1065
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:25,471
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

1066
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:29,558
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

1067
01:35:29,642 --> 01:35:31,477
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1068
01:35:31,518 --> 01:35:33,145
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1069
01:35:33,229 --> 01:35:34,772
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1070
01:36:02,591 --> 01:36:04,677
Is everybody okay back there?

1071
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:08,514
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

1072
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:14,395
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1073
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:18,023
While what?
I watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1074
01:36:18,065 --> 01:36:20,526
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1075
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:23,279
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1076
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:25,197
I'm with you for better or worse.

1077
01:36:25,447 --> 01:36:27,283
I have to do this alone.

1078
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:29,285
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1079
01:36:29,368 --> 01:36:31,245
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again?
- No!

1080
01:36:31,328 --> 01:36:32,579
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1081
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:34,707
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1082
01:36:34,748 --> 01:36:36,834
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1083
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,919
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?

1084
01:36:39,003 --> 01:36:40,921
I can't lose you again!

1085
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:45,217
I can't. Not again.

1086
01:36:45,968 --> 01:36:47,803
I'm not strong enough.

1087
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:59,356
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1088
01:36:59,398 --> 01:37:00,607
I don't know what'll happen.

1089
01:37:01,317 --> 01:37:03,694
We're superheroes. What can happen?

1090
01:37:08,407 --> 01:37:10,117
Vi! Dash! No!

1091
01:37:20,002 --> 01:37:21,003
Violet?

1092
01:37:24,506 --> 01:37:26,759
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1093
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:39,938
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1094
01:37:51,033 --> 01:37:52,368
Frozone!

1095
01:37:52,451 --> 01:37:53,660
Yeah!

1096
01:37:56,455 --> 01:37:57,539
Bob!

1097
01:37:58,916 --> 01:37:59,917
Hey!

1098
01:38:16,183 --> 01:38:17,476
Syndrome's remote!

1099
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:28,570
The remote controls the robot!

1100
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,158
Throw it, throw it!

1101
01:38:33,242 --> 01:38:34,493
Go long!

1102
01:38:45,796 --> 01:38:46,922
Got it!

1103
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:53,762
Honey, take out its guns!

1104
01:39:01,061 --> 01:39:02,104
Gotcha!

1105
01:39:48,192 --> 01:39:49,860
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!

1106
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:54,239
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1107
01:39:57,284 --> 01:39:58,285
The robot?

1108
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:07,711
It's coming back!

1109
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:12,257
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1110
01:40:14,259 --> 01:40:17,262
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is

1111
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:22,267
itself.

1112
01:40:22,351 --> 01:40:23,602
It's getting closer!

1113
01:40:23,644 --> 01:40:25,771
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

1114
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:28,857
It's not doing anything.

1115
01:40:28,941 --> 01:40:30,943
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1116
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:37,950
Honey!

1117
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:46,250
Wait a minute. Press that button again!

1118
01:40:47,793 --> 01:40:50,420
No, the other one! The first one!

1119
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:51,672
First button! Got it!

1120
01:40:51,755 --> 01:40:53,382
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1121
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:56,969
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1122
01:40:57,052 --> 01:40:58,804
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

1123
01:40:58,929 --> 01:41:01,431
- Helen!
- What are you waiting for?

1124
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:03,809
A closer target! You got one shot!

1125
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:07,854
Everybody duck!

1126
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,046
Hey, Zone.

1127
01:41:39,344 --> 01:41:41,179
Huh? No!

1128
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:45,350
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1129
01:41:45,434 --> 01:41:49,605
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1130
01:41:52,649 --> 01:41:55,444
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

1131
01:41:55,527 --> 01:41:57,821
Yeah. Hurt then, too.

1132
01:42:01,241 --> 01:42:03,535
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1133
01:42:03,619 --> 01:42:07,664
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1134
01:42:07,706 --> 01:42:09,750
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1135
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,501
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

1136
01:42:11,543 --> 01:42:13,587
Let the politicians figure that one out.

1137
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:17,299
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1138
01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:18,383
You did good, Bob.

1139
01:42:19,593 --> 01:42:23,972
<i>Hi, this is Kari.
I have a question about Jack-Jack...</i>

1140
01:42:24,056 --> 01:42:25,432
Come on. We're in a limo.

1141
01:42:25,932 --> 01:42:28,518
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1142
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,396
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.
- It looks good.

1143
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,149
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1144
01:42:34,232 --> 01:42:36,526
Not as cool as you running on water.

1145
01:42:36,568 --> 01:42:40,405
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1146
01:42:40,447 --> 01:42:43,075
and whiplashed him into the other guy.
Sweet!

1147
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:45,827
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
<i>- It's me.</i>

1148
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:49,206
<i>Jack-Jack is fine,
but weird things are happening.</i>

1149
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:52,876
<i>Jack-Jack's still fine,
but I'm getting really weirded out!</i>

1150
01:42:53,585 --> 01:42:54,961
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

1151
01:42:55,045 --> 01:42:57,464
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!

1152
01:42:57,547 --> 01:43:01,677
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1153
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,388
<i>I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!</i>

1154
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:07,349
<i>Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.</i>

1155
01:43:07,432 --> 01:43:09,434
<i>I need help, Mrs...</i>

1156
01:43:09,518 --> 01:43:11,144
Bob, listen to this.

1157
01:43:11,228 --> 01:43:13,271
<i>I'm gonna call the police...</i>

1158
01:43:13,647 --> 01:43:15,399
<i>Hi, this is Kari.</i>

1159
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:19,444
<i>Sorry for freaking out,
but your baby has special needs.</i>

1160
01:43:20,195 --> 01:43:21,780
<i>Thanks for sending a replacement.</i>

1161
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:24,074
I didn't call a replacement.

1162
01:43:28,787 --> 01:43:31,915
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1163
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:36,837
You took away my future.

1164
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:40,298
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1165
01:43:40,382 --> 01:43:43,593
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1166
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:47,347
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1167
01:43:51,852 --> 01:43:55,147
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.

1168
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,080
What's happening?

1169
01:44:18,003 --> 01:44:21,173
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1170
01:44:25,302 --> 01:44:26,762
Throw me.

1171
01:44:31,141 --> 01:44:32,601
Bob, throw me!

1172
01:44:38,774 --> 01:44:39,858
No!

1173
01:44:42,194 --> 01:44:45,405
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1174
01:44:45,489 --> 01:44:46,865
I'll get your son!

1175
01:44:48,992 --> 01:44:50,202
Oh, no.

1176
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:04,591
Look at Mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1177
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:07,427
Everything is all right.

1178
01:45:23,068 --> 01:45:24,694
That's my girl.

1179
01:45:25,278 --> 01:45:27,656
Does this mean
we have to move again?

1180
01:45:31,284 --> 01:45:32,702
Oh, man.

1181
01:45:32,911 --> 01:45:35,455
That was totally wicked!

1182
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:55,183
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1183
01:45:55,267 --> 01:45:58,186
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

1184
01:45:58,270 --> 01:45:59,771
- Hey.
- Hey.

1185
01:45:59,813 --> 01:46:02,524
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

1186
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:04,568
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1187
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:08,238
I feel different. Is different okay?

1188
01:46:08,363 --> 01:46:11,616
Hey, different is...
Different is great.

1189
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,660
Would you...

1190
01:46:13,869 --> 01:46:15,453
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

1191
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:17,205
- ...you and I...
- Yeah?

1192
01:46:17,289 --> 01:46:18,623
- Do you...
- Shh.

1193
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:22,002
I like movies.
I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?

1194
01:46:22,919 --> 01:46:25,088
A movie.
There you go. Yeah.

1195
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:27,841
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

1196
01:46:32,971 --> 01:46:35,390
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!

1197
01:46:35,473 --> 01:46:38,435
Come on, run! Pick up the pace.

1198
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:39,519
Run!

1199
01:46:39,603 --> 01:46:40,979
Pull back, pull back!

1200
01:46:41,062 --> 01:46:43,607
Pace it. Slow down just a little bit.

1201
01:46:44,232 --> 01:46:45,775
- Make it close!
- Second.

1202
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:48,486
Close second, yeah!

1203
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,784
That's my boy!

1204
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,828
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1205
01:46:56,912 --> 01:46:58,496
I didn't know what the heck
you wanted me to do.

1206
01:47:11,843 --> 01:47:14,846
<i>Behold the Underminer!</i>

1207
01:47:15,513 --> 01:47:18,016
<i>I am always beneath you,</i>

1208
01:47:18,058 --> 01:47:21,019
<i>but nothing is beneath me!</i>

1209
01:47:21,436 --> 01:47:27,067
<i>I hereby declare war
on peace and happiness!</i>

1210
01:47:27,776 --> 01:47:32,364
<i>Soon all will tremble before me!</i>

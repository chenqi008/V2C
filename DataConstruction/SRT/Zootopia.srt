1
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,370
Fear. Treachery Bloodlust.

2
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,340
Thousands of years ago,

3
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,808
these were the forces
that ruled our world.

4
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,884
A world where prey
were scared of predators.

5
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,207
And predators had an uncontrollable,
biological urge...

6
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,567
to maim, and maul, and...

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,521
Blood! Blood! Blood!

8
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,727
And death.

9
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,766
Back then, the world was divided in two.

10
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,967
Vicious predator...

11
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,524
or meek prey.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,001
But over time, we evolved.

13
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,801
And moved beyond our primitive,
savage ways.

14
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,851
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,884
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

16
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,007
Yeah.

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,528
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,082
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,443
I don't have to be
a lonely hunter anymore.

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,967
Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.

21
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,845
I'm gonna be an actuary!

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,284
And I can make the world a better place.

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,044
I am going to be...

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,889
a police officer!

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,724
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,565
It may seem impossible to small minds...

27
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,371
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,405
But, just 211 miles away...

29
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,121
stands the great city of Zootopia!

30
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,642
Where our ancestors
first joined together in peace...

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,160
and declared that anyone can be anything!

32
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,002
Thank you and good night!

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,331
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

34
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,367
Nope.

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,171
Well, we gave up on our dreams
and we settled. Right, Bon?

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,567
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

37
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,604
See, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,081
If you don't try anything new,
you'll never fail.

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,651
I like trying actually.

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,245
What you father means, hon...

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,925
is it's gonna be difficult,

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,401
impossible even,
for you to become a police officer.

43
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,086
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
Bunnies don't do that.

44
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,321
- Never.
- Never.

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,328
Then, I guess I'll have to be
the first one.

46
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,122
Because I am gonna make the world
a better place.

47
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,171
Or, heck, you know, you want to talk
about making the world a better place...

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,089
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,208
Yes! Your dad, me...

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,450
your 275 brothers and sisters.
We're changing the world!

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,487
One carrot at a time.

52
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,405
Amen to that.
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

53
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,731
Just putting the seeds in the ground.

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,451
At one with the soil.
Just getting covered in dirt.

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,290
You get it, honey.
It's great to have dreams.

56
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,330
Yeah. Just as long as you don't
believe in them too much.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,161
Where'd the heck she go?

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,009
Give me your tickets right now...

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,811
or I'm gonna kick
your meek little sheep butt.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,605
Cut it out, Gideon!

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,205
What are you gonna do? Cry?

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,088
Hey!

63
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,328
You heard her. Cut it out.

64
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,363
Nice costume, loser.

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,420
What crazy world are you living in

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,921
where you think a bunny could be a cop?

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,242
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,322
Come and get them.

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,460
But watch out, because I'm a fox,

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,688
and like you said
in your dumb little stage play...

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,201
us predators used to eat prey.

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,687
And that killer instinct
is still in our "Dunnah."

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,968
I'm pretty much sure
it's pronounced "DNA."

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,690
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,683
You don't scare me, Gideon.

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,802
- You scared now?
- Look at her nose twitch!

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,807
She is scared!

78
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,769
Cry little baby bunny.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,683
Cry, cry...

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,481
You don't know when to quit, do you?

81
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,444
I want you to remember this moment...

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,340
the next time you think you will ever
be anything more than just a stupid...

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,442
carrot-farming, dumb bunny.

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,681
That looks bad.

85
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,330
Are you okay, Judy?

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,642
Yeah. I'm okay.

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,521
Here you go.

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,444
Wow! You got our tickets!

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,965
You're awesome, Judy!

90
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,522
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't
know what he's talking about.

91
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,728
Well, he was right about one thing.

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,489
I don't know when to quit.

93
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,121
Listen up, cadets.

94
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,285
Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems
within its city limits.

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,561
Tundratown...

96
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,921
Sahara Square...

97
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,764
Rainforest District, to name a few.

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,180
You're gonna have to master all of them

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,681
before you hit the streets, or guess what?

100
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,769
You'll be dead!

101
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,848
Scorching sandstorm!

102
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,605
You're dead, Bunny Bumpkin!

103
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,607
1,000-foot fall!

104
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,483
You're dead, Carrot Face!

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,445
Frigid ice wall!

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,920
You're dead, Farm Girl!

107
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,603
Enormous criminal.

108
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,011
You're dead. Dead, dead, dead!

109
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,329
Filthy toilet! You're dead, Fluff Butt.

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,161
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!

111
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,481
There's never been a bunny cop.

112
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,607
- Never.
- Never.

113
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,451
Just a stupid, carrot-farming dumb bunny,

114
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,524
As mayor of Zootopia,
I am proud to announce...

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,963
that my Mammal Inclusion Initiative
has produced...

116
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,845
its first police academy graduate.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,325
Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...

118
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,403
Judy Hopps.

119
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,005
Oh, gosh.

120
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,125
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.

121
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,810
- Oh, yes. Right!
- Thank you.

122
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,246
Yay, Judy!

123
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,168
Judy...

124
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,401
it is my great privilege
to officially assign you...

125
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,683
to the heart of Zootopia: Precinct One.

126
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,001
City Center.

127
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,643
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

128
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,522
I won't let you down. This has been
my dream since I was a kid.

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,287
It's a real proud day for us little guys.

130
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,526
Bellwether, make room, will you? Come on.

131
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,526
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

132
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,364
- Officer Hopps, right here!
- Look this way please!

133
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,601
Hold still. Smile!

134
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,725
We're real proud of you, Judy.

135
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,370
Yeah. Scared, too.

136
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,807
Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,567
I mean, Zootopia. So far away.
Such a big city.

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,562
Guys...

139
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,768
I've been working for this my whole life.

140
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,242
We know. And we're just
a little excited for you, but terrified.

141
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,121
The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,766
And also bears.
We have bears to fear, too.

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,286
Say nothing of lions and wolves.

144
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,481
- Wolves?
- Weasels.

145
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,641
You play cribbage with a weasel.

146
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,926
And he cheats like there's no tomorrow.

147
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,250
You know what, pretty much all
predators. And Zootopia's full of them.

148
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,083
Oh, Stu.

149
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,730
And foxes are the worst.

150
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,005
Actually, your father does have
a point there. It's in their biology.

151
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,446
Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?

152
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,125
When I was nine.

153
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,289
Gideon Grey was a jerk
who happened to be a fox.

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,368
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

155
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,131
Sure, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case...

156
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,402
we made you a little care package
to take with you.

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,648
- And I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.

158
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,847
Yeah, that's safe, to have that.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,445
This is fox repellent.

160
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,567
The deterrent and the repellent,
that's all she needs.

161
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,648
- Check this out!
- For goodness sake.

162
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,580
She has no need for a fox Taser, Stu.

163
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,921
Come on. When is there not
a need for a fox Taser?

164
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,845
Okay, look! I will take this,
to make you stop talking.

165
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,644
Terrific! Everyone wins!

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,366
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

167
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,020
Okay, gotta go! Bye!

168
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,929
Bye, Judy!

169
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,049
I love you guys.

170
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,040
Love you, too.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,809
Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.

172
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Oh, Stu, pull it together.

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,371
Bye, everybody!

174
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,721
- Bye-bye, Judy!
- Bye, Judy!

175
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,490
I love you!

176
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,882
Bye! Bye!

177
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,961
Goodbye!

178
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,165
I messed up tonight
I lost another fight

179
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,002
Lost to myself
But I'll just start again

180
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,362
I keep falling down

181
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,642
I keep on hitting the ground

182
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,410
But I always get up now

183
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,483
To see what's next

184
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,660
Birds don't just fly

185
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,728
They fall down and get up

186
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,891
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

187
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,008
I won't give up
No I won't give in

188
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,100
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

189
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,260
No I won't leave

190
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,811
I want to try everything
I want to try even though I could fail

191
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,620
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

192
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,404
Till I reach the end

193
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,881
Then I'll start again

194
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,404
No, I won't leave I want to try everything

195
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,201
I want to try even though I could fail

196
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,521
Try everything

197
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,931
Try everything

198
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,524
Try everything

199
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,370
I'll keep on making those new mistakes

200
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,284
And I'll keep on making them every day

201
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,241
Those new mistakes

202
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,121
Try everything

203
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,129
Try everything

204
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,204
Try everything

205
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,405
Try everything

206
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,881
I'm Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia.

207
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,481
Welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.

208
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,450
Luxury apartments with charm.

209
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,161
Complimentary delousing
once a month. Don't lose your key.

210
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,651
Thank you.

211
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,962
Hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor.

212
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,087
Yeah? Well, we're loud.

213
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,402
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

214
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,567
Greasy walls.

215
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,046
Hey, shut up!

216
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,122
Rickety bed.

217
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,361
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

218
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,447
Will you shut up?

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,081
Crazy neighbors.

220
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,321
I said, "Shut up!"

221
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,851
I love it!

222
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,166
Shut your mouth, shut up.

223
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,362
Come on!

224
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,329
He bared his teeth first!

225
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,886
Excuse me.

226
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,481
Down here.

227
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,967
Hi.

228
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,043
O-M-Goodness!

229
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,170
They really did hire a bunny! What!

230
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,210
I gotta tell you, you are even cuter
than I thought you'd be!

231
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,602
You probably didn't know, but a bunny
can call another bunny "cute"...

232
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,364
but when other animals do it...

233
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,567
it's a little...

234
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,241
I am so sorry! Me, Benjamin Clawhauser...

235
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,564
the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby,
donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

236
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,286
No, it's okay. Oh, you've actually got...
There's a...

237
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,726
In your neck. The fold.

238
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,609
Where? Oh!

239
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,604
There you went, you little dickens!

240
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,729
I should get to roll call,
which way do I...?

241
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,445
Bullpen's over there to the left.

242
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,210
Great. Thank you.

243
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,170
That poor little bunny's
gonna get eaten alive.

244
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,808
Hey, Officer Hopps.

245
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,803
You ready to make the world
a better place?

246
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,247
Atten-hut!

247
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,126
All right! Everybody sit.

248
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,571
I've got three items on the docket.

249
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,442
First... we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.

250
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,127
Francine...

251
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,161
Happy birthday.

252
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,601
Number two.

253
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,604
There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce...

254
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,727
but I'm not going to....

255
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,689
because I don't care.

256
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,640
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.

257
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,640
All predators, from a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.

258
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,881
And City Hall
is right up my tail to find them.

259
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,323
This is priority number one.

260
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,641
Assignments.

261
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,126
Officers Grizzoli...

262
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,300
Fangmeyer, Delgato.

263
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,563
Your teams take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.

264
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,885
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.

265
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,520
Your teams take Sahara Square.

266
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,808
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,889
Tundratown.

268
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,850
And finally, our first bunny...

269
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,571
Officer Hopps.

270
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,401
Parking Duty.

271
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,166
Dismissed.

272
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,964
Parking duty?

273
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,366
Chief!

274
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,402
Chief Bogo?

275
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,401
Sir, you said there were
14 missing mammal cases.

276
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,085
- So?
- So, I can handle one.

277
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,801
You probably forgot, but I was
top of my class at the Academy.

278
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,407
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

279
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,563
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

280
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,564
Well, then writing 100 tickets a day
should be easy.

281
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,485
100 tickets.
I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.

282
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,762
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.

283
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,046
Before noon.

284
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,927
Boom!

285
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,804
200 tickets before noon!

286
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,161
201.

287
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,520
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

288
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,363
Where'd he go?

289
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,920
I don't know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours...

290
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,444
but I don't want any trouble in here.
So, hit the road.

291
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,220
I'm not looking
for any trouble either, sir.

292
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,449
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop...

293
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,090
for my little boy.

294
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,887
You want the red or the blue, pal?

295
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,605
I'm such a...

296
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,642
Come on, kid. Back up.

297
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,167
Listen, buddy. What? There aren't any
fox ice cream joints...

298
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,407
in your part of town?

299
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,641
No, no. There are.

300
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,606
There are. It's just, my boy,
this goofy little stinker...

301
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,770
he loves all things elephant.
Wants to be one when he grows up.

302
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,846
Is that adorable?

303
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,563
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams? Right?

304
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,562
You probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says...

305
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,883
"We reserve the right to refuse service...

306
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,247
"...to anyone." So, beat it.

307
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,442
You're holding up the line.

308
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,287
Hello? Excuse me.

309
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,404
You're gonna have to wait your turn
like everyone else, meter maid.

310
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,369
Actually, I'm an officer.

311
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,085
Just had a quick question.

312
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,602
Are your customers aware
they're getting snot and mucus

313
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,642
with their cookies and cream?

314
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,130
What are you talking about?

315
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,807
I don't want to cause you any trouble,
but I believe scooping ice cream...

316
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,480
with an ungloved trunk
is a Class 3 health code violation.

317
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,243
Which is kind of a big deal.

318
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,323
Of course,
I could let you off with a warning...

319
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,121
if you were to glove those trunks and,
I don't know...

320
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,648
finish selling this nice dad
and his son a...

321
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,767
What was it?

322
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,002
A Jumbo Pop. Please.

323
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,605
A Jumbo Pop.

324
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,965
$15.

325
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,130
Thank you so much. Thank you.

326
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,523
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
I don't have my wallet.

327
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,490
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached
to my neck. That's the truth.

328
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,440
Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.
Got to be about the worst birthday ever.

329
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,807
Please don't be mad at me.

330
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,611
Thanks anyway.

331
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,164
Keep the change.

332
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,288
Officer, I can't thank you enough.

333
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,211
So kind, really. Can I pay you back?

334
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,846
Oh, no, My treat. It just...

335
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,620
You know, it burns me up to see folks

336
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,961
with such backward attitudes toward foxes.

337
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,970
I just wanna say
you're a great dad and just a...

338
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,004
a real articulate fella.

339
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,723
Well, that is high praise. It's rare that
I find someone so non-patronizing.

340
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,642
Officer...

341
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,006
Hopps. Mister...

342
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,481
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

343
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,005
And you, little guy...

344
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,403
You want to be an elephant
when you grow up? You be an elephant.

345
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,801
Because this is Zootopia.

346
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,247
Anyone can be anything.

347
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,886
Boy, I tell him that all the time.

348
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,044
All right, here you go. Two paws. Yeah.

349
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,170
Look at that smile.
That's a "happy birthday" smile.

350
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,721
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

351
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,246
Toot-toot!

352
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,407
Bye, now.

353
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,402
Goodbye!

354
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,889
Hey, little Toot-Toot...

355
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,090
Popsicles!

356
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,605
Get your popsicles!

357
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,767
Lumber delivery.

358
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,961
What's with the color?

359
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,121
The color?

360
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,041
That's red wood.

361
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,050
39, 40. There you go.

362
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,609
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

363
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,760
Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?

364
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,643
You kiss me tomorrow,
I'll bite your face off.

365
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,801
Ciao.

366
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,368
Well. I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

367
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,766
You liar!

368
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,485
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

369
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,642
And I'm not the liar. He is.

370
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,322
Hey!

371
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,324
All right, slick Nick,
you're under arrest.

372
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,800
Really? For what?

373
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,367
Gee, I don't know.
How about selling food without a permit.

374
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,602
Transporting undeclared commerce
across borough lines.

375
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,841
False advertising.

376
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,924
Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

377
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,321
And I didn't falsely advertise anything.
Take care.

378
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,687
You told that mouse
the popsicle sticks were redwood!

379
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,320
That's right. "Red wood."
With a space in the middle.

380
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,845
Wood that is red.

381
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,287
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.

382
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,204
You're gonna want to refrain
from calling me Carrots.

383
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,740
My bad. I just naturally assumed

384
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,161
you came from some little
carrot-choked Podunk, no?

385
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,083
No!

386
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,641
Podunk is in Deerbrooke County,
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

387
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,327
Okay. Tell me
if this story sounds familiar.

388
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,926
Naive little hick with good grades
and big ideas...

389
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,691
decides, "Hey, look at me!
I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

390
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,844
where predators and prey
live in harmony and sing "Kumbaya."

391
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,088
Only to find, whoopsie...

392
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,363
we don't all get along. And that
dream of becoming a big city cop?

393
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,047
Double whoopsie. She's a meter maid.
And, whoopsie number three-sie...

394
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,282
no one cares about her or her dreams.

395
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,488
And soon enough, those dreams die

396
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,364
and our bunny sinks into emotional
and literal squalor...

397
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,050
living in a box under a bridge...

398
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,567
till finally she has no choice
but to go back home...

399
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,200
with that cute, fuzzy-wuzzy little tail
between her legs...

400
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,327
to become...

401
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,005
You're from Bunnyburrow,
is that what you said?

402
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,050
So how about a carrot farmer.
That sound about right?

403
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,283
Be careful, now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.

404
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,565
Hey! No one tells me
what I can or can't be!

405
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,722
Especially not some jerk...

406
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,403
who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a popsicle hustler.

407
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,087
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia...

408
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,044
thinking they can be anything they want.

409
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,611
Well, you can't.

410
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,001
You can only be what you are.

411
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,328
Sly fox, dumb bunny.

412
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,324
I'm not a dumb bunny.

413
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,806
Right. And that's not wet cement.

414
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,726
You'll never be a real cop.

415
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,120
You're a cute meter maid, though.

416
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,649
Maybe a supervisor one day.

417
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,723
Hang in there.

418
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,807
You can't do nothing right, babe

419
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,962
I'm a loser

420
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,169
Oh, hey, it's my parents.

421
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,845
Oh, there she is!

422
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,762
Hi, sweetheart!

423
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,685
Hey there, Jude the dude.
How was your first day on the force?

424
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,842
- It was real great.
- Yeah?

425
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,206
Everything you ever hoped?

426
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,686
Absolutely.

427
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,289
And more. Everyone's so nice and...

428
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,851
- I feel like I'm making a difference.
- Wait a second.

429
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,240
Holy cripes, Bonnie, look at that.

430
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,965
Oh, my sweet heaven!

431
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,128
Judy, are you a meter maid?

432
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,727
This? No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing.

433
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,211
It's the safest job on the force!

434
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,966
She's not a real cop.
Our prayers have been answered!

435
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,367
- Glorious day!
- Meter maid! Meter maid!

436
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,205
- Meter maid! Meter maid!
- Dad. Dad. Dad!

437
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,044
It's been a really long day.
I should really...

438
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,326
That's right, you get some rest.

439
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,811
Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.

440
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,365
Bye-bye.

441
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,690
Buh-bye.

442
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,886
Hey, buddy, turn down
that depressing music.

443
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,204
Leave the meter maid alone.
Didn't you hear her conversation?

444
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,521
She feels like a failure!

445
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,205
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!

446
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,647
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

447
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,564
Tomorrow's another day.

448
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,007
Yeah, but it might be worse!

449
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,403
I was 30 seconds over!

450
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,002
You're a real hero, lady!

451
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,881
My mommy says she wishes you were dead.

452
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,207
Uncool, rabbit.
My tax dollars pay your salary.

453
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,564
I am a real cop. I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.

454
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,326
Hey, hey! You, bunny!

455
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,371
Sir. If you have a grievance, you may
contest your citation in traffic court.

456
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,409
What are you talking about? My shop!

457
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,443
It was just robbed! Look!

458
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,971
He's getting away!

459
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,570
Are you a cop or not?

460
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,525
Yes! Don't worry, sir! I've got this!

461
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,845
Stop! Stop, in the name of the law!

462
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,841
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

463
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,362
Coming through!

464
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,249
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-31.

465
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,526
I got dibs!

466
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,125
Officer Hopps. I am in pursuit!

467
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,530
You!

468
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,488
Freeze!

469
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,802
Hey, meter maid! Wait for the real cops!

470
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,121
Stop!

471
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,961
Sorry. Coming through.

472
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,361
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

473
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,246
Bon voyage-e, flat foot!

474
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,330
Hey, stop right there!

475
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,771
Have a donut, copper!

476
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,002
Oh, my God. Did you see
those leopard print jeggings?

477
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,611
I love your hair.

478
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,201
Thank you.

479
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,049
Come to papa.

480
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,725
You're gonna have to be patient and
wait in line just like everyone else...

481
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,928
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

482
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,722
I popped the weasel!

483
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,644
Hopps!

484
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,300
Abandoning your post.

485
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,811
Inciting a scurry.

486
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,923
Reckless endangerment of rodents.

487
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,929
But, to be fair...

488
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,641
you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

489
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,006
Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.

490
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,885
Those are a crocus varietal
called midnicampum holicithias.

491
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,286
They're a Class-C botanical, sir.

492
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,006
I grew up in a family where
plant husbandry was kind of a thing.

493
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,685
Shut your tiny mouth now!

494
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,364
Sir, I got the bad guy.

495
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,567
That's my job.

496
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,849
Your job is putting tickets on parked cars!

497
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,765
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's here
to see you again.

498
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,842
Not now.

499
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,286
Okay, I just didn't know
if you'd want to take it this time.

500
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,407
She seems really upset.

501
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,971
- Not now!
- Sir...

502
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,966
I don't want to be a meter maid,
I want to be a real cop.

503
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,886
Do you think the mayor asked me what
I wanted when he assigned you to me?

504
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,246
But, sir, if...

505
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,125
Life isn't some cartoon musical
where you sing a little song...

506
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,727
and your insipid dreams
magically come true.

507
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,645
So, let it go.

508
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,763
Chief Bogo, please.
Five minutes of your time.

509
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,967
I'm sorry, sir.

510
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,248
I tried to stop her.
She is super-slippery.

511
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,124
I gotta go sit down.

512
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,643
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

513
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,600
My husband has been missing for
10 days. His name is Emmitt Otterton.

514
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,807
Yes, I know.

515
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,008
He's a florist.

516
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,443
We have two beautiful children.
He would never just disappear.

517
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,570
Ma'am, our detectives are very busy.

518
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,770
Please. There's got to be someone
to find my Emmitt.

519
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,728
Mrs. Otterton...

520
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,887
I will find him.

521
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,130
Thank you.

522
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,330
Bless you. Bless you, little bunny.

523
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,047
Take this.

524
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,601
Find my Emmitt. Bring him home...

525
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,683
to me and my babies, please.

526
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,166
Mrs. Otterton, please wait out here.

527
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,004
Of course. Thank you both so much.

528
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,487
One second.

529
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,684
You're fired.

530
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,001
What? Why?

531
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,531
Insubordination!

532
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,364
Now. I'm going to open this door...

533
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,330
and you're going to tell that otter
you're a former meter maid...

534
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,642
with delusions of grandeur...

535
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,524
who will not be taking the case!

536
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,530
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case.

537
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,170
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.

538
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,568
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.

539
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,445
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna
be so jazzed!

540
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,527
No, let's not tell the Mayor just yet.

541
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,530
And I've sent it and it is done,
so I did do that.

542
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,210
Well, I'd say the case is in good hands.

543
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,011
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

544
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,486
Like glue.

545
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,047
Good one.

546
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,168
Just call me
if you ever need anything, okay?

547
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,089
You've always got a friend
at City Hall, Judy.

548
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,685
All right, bye-bye.

549
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,888
Thank you, ma'am.

550
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,091
I will give you 48 hours.

551
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,321
Yes!

552
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,720
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.

553
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,529
Okay.

554
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,924
But, you strike out, you resign.

555
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,241
Okay.

556
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,287
Deal!

557
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,240
Splendid. Clawhauser will
give you the complete case file.

558
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,606
Here you go.

559
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,210
One missing otter.

560
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,801
That's it?

561
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,123
Yikes! That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen.

562
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,561
Leads, none. Witnesses, none.

563
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,763
And you're not in the computer system
yet, so resources, none!

564
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,082
I hope you didn't stake your career
on cracking this one!

565
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,523
Okay. Last known sighting.

566
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,961
Can I just borrow... Thank you.

567
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,166
Popsicle?

568
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,850
The murder weapon.

569
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,490
Get your popsicle.

570
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,326
Yeah. Because that... What does that mean?

571
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,402
It means...

572
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,760
I have a lead.

573
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,805
Hi! Hello? It's me, again!

574
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,962
Hey, it's Officer Toot-Toot.

575
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,128
No. Actually, it's Officer Hopps...

576
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,169
and I'm here to ask you some questions
about a case.

577
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,766
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

578
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,649
It wasn't me.

579
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,171
Hey, Carrots, you're going to
wake the baby. I gotta get to work.

580
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,521
This is important, sir.

581
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,843
I think your $10 worth of popsicles
can wait.

582
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,206
I make 200 bucks a day, Fluff!

583
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,529
365 days a year, since I was 12.

584
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,290
And time is money. Hop along.

585
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,363
Please, just look at the picture.

586
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,126
You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle,
right? Do you know him?

587
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,002
I know everybody.

588
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,722
And I also know that, somewhere...

589
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,980
there's a toy store
missing its stuffed animal,

590
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,811
so why don't you get back to your box?

591
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,689
Fine. Then we'll have to do this
the hard way.

592
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,045
Did you just boot my stroller?

593
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,049
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

594
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,848
For what? Hurting your feelings?

595
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,206
Felony Tax Evasion.

596
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,210
Yeah, $200 a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12.

597
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,002
That's two decades, so times 20,
which is $1,460,000, I think.

598
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,721
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.

599
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,644
Anyway, according to your tax forms...

600
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,485
you reported, let me see here... zero!

601
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,930
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.

602
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,570
Five years jail time.

603
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,927
Well, it's my word against yours.

604
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,769
200 bucks a day, Fluff!

605
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,605
365 days a year, since I was 12.

606
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,649
Actually, it's your word against yours.

607
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,207
And if you want this pen, you're going to
help me find this poor, missing otter...

608
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,206
or the only place you'll be selling
popsicles is the prison cafeteria.

609
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,083
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

610
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,402
She hustled you.

611
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,170
She hustled you good!

612
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,409
You a cop now, Nick.
You gonna need one of these.

613
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,766
Have fun...

614
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,967
working with the fuzz!

615
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,645
Start talking.

616
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,602
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.

617
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,762
Great. Let's go.

618
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,122
It's not exactly a place for...

619
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,441
a cute little bunny.

620
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,568
Don't call me cute. Get in the car.

621
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,603
Okay. You're the boss.

622
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,011
Hi.

623
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,121
Hello?

624
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,446
Hello?

625
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,569
Hello? Hello?

626
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,170
Hello. My name is...

627
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,483
You know, I'm going to hit
the pause button right there...

628
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,881
because we're all good
on Bunny Scout cookies.

629
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,927
No.

630
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,367
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

631
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,286
I'm looking for a missing mammal,
Emmitt Otterton, right here...

632
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,046
who may have frequented
this establishment.

633
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,284
Yeah, old Emmitt.

634
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,841
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

635
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,163
But, hey, you should talk
to his yoga instructor.

636
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,004
I'd be happy to take you back.

637
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,047
Thank you so much.

638
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,540
I'd appreciate that more than
you can imagine, it would be such...

639
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,766
You are naked!

640
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,005
For sure, we're a naturalist club.

641
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,448
Yeah. In Zootopia, anyone can be anything.

642
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,483
These guys, they be naked.

643
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,610
Nangi's just on the other side
of the Pleasure Pool.

644
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,206
Oh, boy.

645
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,209
Does this make you uncomfortable?

646
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,762
Because if so, there is no
shame in calling it quits.

647
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,928
Yes, there is.

648
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,082
Boy, that's the spirit.

649
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,363
Yeah, some mammals say
the naturalist life is weird...

650
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,648
but you know what I say is weird?

651
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,649
Clothes on animals!

652
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,044
Here we go.

653
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,888
As you can see, Nangi's an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.

654
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,201
Hey, Nangi.

655
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,609
These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.

656
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,568
Who?

657
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,042
Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to
your yoga class for like...

658
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,571
6 years?

659
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,330
I have no memory of this beaver.

660
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,244
He's an otter, actually.

661
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,124
He was here
a couple Wednesdays ago, remember?

662
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,042
No.

663
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,960
Yeah, he was wearing
a green cable-knit sweater vest...

664
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:27,405
and a new pair of corduroy slacks.
And a paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

665
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,449
Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?

666
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,300
No.

667
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,260
And we both walked him out,
and he got into this big old white car

668
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,771
with a silver trim.

669
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,725
Needed a tune-up.
The third cylinder wasn't firing.

670
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,769
- Remember that, Nangi?
- No.

671
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,689
You didn't happen to catch
the license plate number, did you?

672
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,770
Oh, for sure. It was 2-9...

673
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,684
T-H-D...

674
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,729
- 0-3.
- 0-3. Wow.

675
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,285
This is a lot of great info. Thank you.

676
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,603
Told you Nangi has a mind
like a steel trap.

677
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,810
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

678
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,168
Well, I had a ball.

679
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,765
You are welcome for the clue...

680
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,820
and seeing as how any moron
can run a plate,

681
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,844
I will take that pen and bid you adieu.

682
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,806
The plate. I can't run a plate.

683
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,246
I'm not in the system yet.

684
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,483
Give me the pen, please.

685
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,131
What was it you said?

686
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,282
"Any moron can run a plate"?

687
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,202
Gosh. If only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.

688
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,643
Rabbit, I did what you asked!
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

689
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,010
Not forever. Well, I only have
36 hours left to solve this case.

690
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,601
So can you run the plate or not?

691
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,400
Actually, I just remembered...

692
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,851
I have a pal at the DMV

693
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,650
Flash is the fastest guy in there.

694
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,484
If you need something done, he's on it.

695
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,171
I hope so. We are really fighting
the clock and every minute counts.

696
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,130
Wait. They're all sloths?

697
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,010
You said this was going to be quick!

698
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,289
Are you saying that because
he's a sloth, he can't be fast?

699
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,886
I thought in Zootopia,
anyone could be anything.

700
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,891
Flash, Flash, hundred-yard dash.
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

701
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,009
Nice to...

702
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,006
see you...

703
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,561
too.

704
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,007
Hey, Flash,
I'd love you to meet my friend.

705
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,090
Darling, I've forgotten your name.

706
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,411
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?

707
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,891
I am...

708
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,401
doing...

709
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,405
just...

710
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,727
Fine?

711
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,042
...as well as...

712
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,446
I can...

713
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,762
be.

714
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,206
- What...
- Hang in there.

715
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,407
...can I...

716
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,690
- do...
- I was hoping you could run a...

717
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,841
...for you...

718
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,087
Well, I was hoping you could...

719
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,287
today?

720
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,407
Well, I was hoping you could
run a plate for us.

721
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,289
We are in a really big hurry.

722
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,200
Sure.

723
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,725
What's the...

724
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,049
- plate...
- 2-9-T...

725
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,326
...number?

726
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,202
2-9-T-H-D-0-3

727
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,441
Two...

728
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,721
nine...

729
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,248
T-H-D-0-3.

730
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,281
...T...

731
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,570
H-D-0-3.

732
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,282
...H...

733
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,442
D-0-3.

734
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,607
...D...

735
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,245
0-3.

736
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,443
...0...

737
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,726
3.

738
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,130
Hey, Flash, want to hear a joke?

739
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,281
No!

740
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,761
Sure.

741
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,285
Okay. What do you call
a three-humped camel?

742
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,725
I don't...

743
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,086
know.

744
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,321
What...

745
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,487
do...

746
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,324
you call...

747
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,403
- a...
- Three-humped camel.

748
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,971
...three-humped...

749
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,968
camel?

750
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,161
Pregnant.

751
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,085
Yes, very funny, very funny.

752
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,480
Can we please just focus on the...

753
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,100
- Hey...
- Wait, wait, wait!

754
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,531
...Priscilla!

755
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,841
Oh, no!

756
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,330
Yes...

757
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,140
Flash?

758
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,002
What...

759
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,002
do...

760
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,844
- No!
- ...you call a...

761
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,446
A three-humped camel? "Pregnant!"
Okay, great, we got it.

762
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,001
...three... humped...

763
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,170
- Here...
- Yeah. Hurry.

764
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,368
- ...you...
- Thank you. "2-9-T-H-D-0-3."

765
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,442
...go.

766
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,001
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.

767
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,323
A limo took Otterton,
and the limo's in Tundratown!

768
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,244
Way to hustle, bud. I love you. I owe you.

769
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,203
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour, and...

770
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,328
It's night?

771
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,124
Closed. Great.

772
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,200
And I will bet you
you don't have a warrant to get in.

773
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,289
Darn it. It's a bummer.

774
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,363
You wasted the day on purpose.

775
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,220
Madam, I have a fake badge.

776
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,721
I would never impede
your pretend investigation.

777
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,046
It's not a pretend investigation. Look,
see? See him? This otter is missing.

778
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,921
Then they should've gotten
a real cop to find him.

779
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,281
What is your problem?

780
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,300
Does seeing me fail
somehow make you feel better

781
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,243
about your own sad, miserable life?

782
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,448
It does. 100%.

783
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,883
Now, since you're sans warrant...

784
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,884
I guess we're... done?

785
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,609
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

786
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,609
Hey!

787
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,005
First off, you throw like a bunny.

788
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,687
Second, you're a very sore loser.
See you later, Officer Fluff.

789
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,650
So sad this is over.
I wish I could've helped more.

790
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,043
The thing is, you don't need a warrant
if you have probable cause...

791
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,125
and I'm pretty sure I saw
a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

792
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,800
So you're helping plenty. Come on.

793
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,651
2-9-T-H-D-0-3. This is it!

794
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,766
Polar bear fur.

795
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,405
- Oh, my God!
- What?

796
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,291
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.

797
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,526
But on CD.

798
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,045
Who still uses CDs?

799
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,409
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.

800
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,361
Those are claw marks.

801
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,730
You ever seen anything like this?

802
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,967
No.

803
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,891
Wait, look.

804
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,242
This is him, Emmitt Otterton.

805
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,801
He was definitely here.

806
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,122
What do you think happened?

807
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,001
Now, wait a minute.

808
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,765
Polar bear fur, Rat Pack music, fancy cup?

809
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,967
I know whose car this is. We got to go.

810
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,660
Why? Whose car is it?

811
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,764
The most feared crime-boss
in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big.

812
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,400
And he does not like me. So we gotta go!

813
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,369
I'm not leaving. This is a crime scene.

814
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,847
It's gonna be an even bigger
crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here...

815
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,366
so we're leaving right now.

816
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,001
Raymond!

817
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,208
And is that Kevin? Long time, no see.

818
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,448
And, speaking of "no see,"
how about you forget you saw me?

819
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,647
For old times' sake?

820
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,887
That's a no.

821
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,081
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?

822
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,885
I may have sold him
a very expensive wool rug...

823
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,931
that was made from the fur of a skunk...

824
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,122
's butt.

825
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,407
Sweet cheese and crackers.

826
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,525
Is that Mr. Big?

827
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,761
No.

828
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,081
What about him?

829
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,401
- Is that him?
- No!

830
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,481
That's got to be him.

831
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,165
Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking!

832
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,562
Mr. Big, sir. This is a simple...

833
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,327
Yeah.

834
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,529
This is a simple misunderstanding.

835
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,447
You come here, unannounced, on the
day my daughter is to be married.

836
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,602
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...

837
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,567
The point is, I did not know
that it was your car...

838
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,240
and I certainly did not know
about your daughter's wedding.

839
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,364
I trusted you, Nicky.

840
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,409
I welcomed you into my home.

841
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,841
We broke bread together.

842
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,488
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.

843
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,768
And how did you repay my generosity?

844
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,891
With a rug made from the butt of a skunk.

845
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,849
A skunk-butt rug.

846
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,570
You disrespected me.

847
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,487
You disrespected my Gram-mama,
who I buried in that skunk butt rug.

848
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,726
I told you never to show your face
here again but here you are...

849
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,844
snooping around with this...

850
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,286
What are you? A performer?

851
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,601
What's with the costume?

852
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,568
Sir. I am a...

853
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,250
Mime! She is a mime.

854
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,609
This... mime cannot speak.
You can't speak if you're a mime.

855
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,000
No, I am a cop.

856
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,810
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

857
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,531
And my evidence puts him in your car.

858
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,205
So intimidate me all you want.

859
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,122
I'm going to find out what you did
to that otter if it's the last thing I do.

860
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,050
Then I have only one request.

861
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,642
Say hello to Gram-mama. Ice 'em.

862
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,725
I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

863
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,160
And you never will.

864
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,731
Please! No, no, no!

865
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,480
If you're mad at me about the rug,
I've got more rugs!

866
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,651
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

867
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,366
What did we say?

868
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,642
No icing anyone at my wedding!

869
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,246
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.

870
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,322
Ice 'em.

871
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,367
No, no no!

872
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,527
Wait. Please!

873
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,049
She's the bunny
that saved my life yesterday!

874
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,486
From that giant donut.

875
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,641
This bunny?

876
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,484
Yeah! Hi!

877
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,047
Hi. I love your dress.

878
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,761
Thank you.

879
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,281
Put 'em down.

880
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,485
You've done me a great service.

881
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,802
I will help you find the otter.

882
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,927
I will take your kindness
and pay it forward.

883
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,609
Otterton is my florist.

884
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,527
He's like a part of the family.

885
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,644
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

886
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,724
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.

887
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,204
But he never arrived.

888
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,130
Because he was attacked.

889
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,806
No. He attacked.

890
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,361
Otterton?

891
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,689
Otterton. He went crazy.

892
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,811
Ripped up the car,
scared my driver half to death...

893
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,440
and disappeared into the night.

894
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,769
But he's a sweet little otter.

895
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,124
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down...

896
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,521
we are still animals.

897
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,740
You want to find Otterton,
talk to the driver of that car.

898
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,444
His name is Manchas...

899
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,166
lives in the Rainforest District.

900
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,800
Only he can tell you more.

901
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,284
Mr. Manchas?

902
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,488
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

903
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,729
We just wanna know
what happened to Emmitt Otterton.

904
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,641
You...

905
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,006
should be asking...

906
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,962
what happened to me.

907
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,090
A teensy otter did that?

908
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,571
What happened?

909
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,569
He was an animal.

910
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,882
Down...

911
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,521
on all fours.

912
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,971
He was a savage!

913
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,921
There was no warning.

914
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,327
He just kept yelling
about the Night Howlers.

915
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,050
Over and over. The Night Howlers.

916
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,602
So you know about the Night Howlers, too?

917
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,171
Good. Good, good.

918
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,922
Because the Night Howlers are exactly
what we are here to talk about.

919
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,491
- Right?
- Yup.

920
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,368
So, you just open the door...

921
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,090
and tell us what you know...

922
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,408
and we will tell you what we know. Okay?

923
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,088
Okay.

924
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,088
Clever fox.

925
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,922
Mr. Manchas?

926
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,082
Buddy?

927
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,366
Are you...

928
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,367
okay?

929
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,925
Run. Run!

930
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,006
What is wrong with him?

931
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,525
I don't know!

932
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,447
Jump!

933
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,081
Come on!

934
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,206
Head down!

935
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,645
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.

936
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,122
Are you familiar with Gazelle, greatest
singer of our lifetime, angel with horns?

937
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,340
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.
Who's that beside her? Who is it?

938
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,762
Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.

939
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,842
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!

940
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,685
It's not, it's just a new app.
Hold on a second.

941
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,285
Clawhauser!

942
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,371
Listen to me, we have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!

943
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,447
Vine and Tuh-junja!

944
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,761
It's "Tuh-hunga!"

945
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,930
Okay, we're sending backup! Hopps?

946
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,845
Hopps!

947
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,328
There!

948
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,930
Head for the sky trams!

949
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,930
Get in! Carrots.

950
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,047
Carrots!

951
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,042
Go!

952
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,283
No, no, no!

953
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,726
Buddy.

954
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,689
One predator to another...

955
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,809
Now, I can tell you're a little tense...

956
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,644
so I'm just gonna give you
a little personal space!

957
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,328
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!

958
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,420
- I'm gonna let go!
- No, you, what?

959
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,522
One, two...

960
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,045
Carrots. You saved my life.

961
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,409
Well. That's what we do at the ZPD.

962
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,568
Well, this should be good.

963
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,365
I thought this was just a missing
mammal case but it's way bigger.

964
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,648
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

965
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,850
I believe he and this jaguar,
they went savage, sir.

966
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,881
Savage? This isn't the Stone Age,
Hopps. Animals don't "go savage."

967
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,083
I thought so, too, until I saw this.

968
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,980
What? He was right here.

969
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,605
The "savage" jaguar?

970
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,660
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

971
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,220
Or, maybe any aggressive predator
looks savage to you rabbits.

972
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,242
Let's go!

973
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,447
Wait, sir.

974
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,500
I'm not the only one who saw him.

975
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,840
Nick!

976
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,483
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

977
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,340
He was a key witness, and I...

978
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,660
Two days to find the otter...

979
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,081
or you quit.

980
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,969
That was the deal.

981
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,645
Badge.

982
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,929
- But, sir, we...
- Badge!

983
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,890
No.

984
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,380
What did you say, fox?

985
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,020
Sorry. What I said was, "no."

986
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,964
She will not be giving you that badge.

987
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,846
Look, you give her a clown vest
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile...

988
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,884
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

989
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,841
Yeah.

990
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,485
No wonder she needed to get help
from a fox.

991
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,802
None of you guys
were gonna help her, were you?

992
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,325
Here's the thing, Chief.

993
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,860
You gave her the 48 hours...

994
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,962
so, technically, we still have...

995
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,288
10 left to find our Mr. Otterton...

996
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,761
and that is exactly what we're gonna do.

997
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,284
So, if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.

998
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,805
Good day.

999
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,090
Officer Hopps.

1000
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,210
Thank you.

1001
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,681
Never let them see that they get to you.

1002
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,200
So...

1003
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,761
things do get to you?

1004
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,361
No, I mean, not anymore...

1005
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,525
but I was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

1006
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,687
Har-har.

1007
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,808
No, it's true.

1008
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,043
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

1009
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,180
and all I wanted to do
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

1010
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,060
So, my mom scraped together enough money

1011
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,561
to buy me a brand-new uniform...

1012
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,291
because, by God, I was gonna fit in.

1013
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,780
Even if I was the only predator
in the troop.

1014
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,802
The only fox.

1015
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,802
Okay, Nick.

1016
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,564
I was gonna be part of a pack.

1017
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,180
Ready for initiation?

1018
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,140
Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

1019
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,004
I was so proud.

1020
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,728
Okay.

1021
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,326
Now, raise your right paw
and deliver the oath.

1022
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,923
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave...

1023
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,004
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.

1024
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,980
Even though you're a fox?

1025
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,411
What?

1026
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,241
No! What did I do wrong, you guys?

1027
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,607
No, please! Tell me! What did I do wrong?

1028
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,370
What did I do?

1029
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,766
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle...

1030
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,851
you're even dumber than you look!

1031
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,010
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1032
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,160
I learned two things that day,

1033
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,651
One...

1034
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,850
I was never gonna let anyone see
that they got to me.

1035
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,120
And two?

1036
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,280
If the world's only gonna see a fox
as shifty and untrustworthy...

1037
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,444
there's no point in trying
to be anything else.

1038
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,161
Nick, you are so much more than that.

1039
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,970
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

1040
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,770
How about we go out to Chuck
in Traffic Central.

1041
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,644
Chuck, how are things looking
on the Jam Cams?

1042
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,968
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

1043
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,410
The Jam Cams.

1044
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,245
- Seriously. It's okay.
- No, no, no.

1045
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,609
There are traffic cameras everywhere!

1046
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,460
All over the canopy!

1047
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,846
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

1048
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,206
The traffic cams would have caught it!

1049
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,208
Bingo!

1050
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,205
Pretty sneaky, slick!

1051
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,722
However, if you didn't have access
to the system before...

1052
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,521
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt
is gonna let you into it now.

1053
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,841
No.

1054
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,007
But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

1055
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,611
Sir, if we could just review
these very important...

1056
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,002
Sir...

1057
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,525
I'm so sorry. Sir!

1058
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,689
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether.
Just take care of it.

1059
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,761
Please. And clear my afternoon.
I'm going out.

1060
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,321
No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting
with Herds and Grazing.

1061
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,891
Sir, if I could just...

1062
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,568
Oh, mutton chops.

1063
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,770
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?

1064
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,126
We need your help.

1065
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,324
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

1066
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,010
So fluffy!

1067
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:27,928
Hey!

1068
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,565
Sheep never let me get this close.

1069
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,131
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

1070
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,281
It's like cotton candy.

1071
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,407
Stop it!

1072
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,641
Where to?

1073
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,090
Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga.

1074
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,169
There! Traffic cams for the whole city.

1075
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,527
This is so exciting, actually!

1076
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,330
I never get to do anything this important.

1077
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,881
But you're the Assistant Mayor
of Zootopia.

1078
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,407
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

1079
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,046
I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote.

1080
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,565
But he did give me that nice mug.

1081
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,171
Feels good to be appreciated.

1082
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,651
Smell-wether!

1083
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,531
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

1084
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,569
I called him Lion-fart once.

1085
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,121
He did not care for that. Let me tell you,
it was not a good day for me.

1086
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,048
Yes, sir?

1087
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,844
I thought you were going to
cancel my afternoon!

1088
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,884
Oh, dear. I better go.

1089
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,641
Let me know what you find.
It was really nice for me to be...

1090
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,723
While we're young, Smell-wether!

1091
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,889
You think when she goes to sleep
she counts herself?

1092
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,929
Shush. Okay, traffic cams.

1093
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,209
Tujunga, Tujunga... We're in.

1094
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,609
Who are these guys?

1095
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,604
Timberwolves. Look at these dumb-dumbs.

1096
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,851
Bet you a nickel
one of them is gonna howl.

1097
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,325
And there it is.

1098
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,220
What is it with wolves and the howling?
It's like...

1099
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,243
Howlers. Night Howlers.

1100
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,562
That's what Manchas was afraid of! Wolves!

1101
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,200
The wolves are the Night Howlers.
If they took Manchas...

1102
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,089
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.

1103
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,766
All we gotta do
is find out where they went.

1104
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,207
Wait, where did they go?

1105
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,603
If I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal...

1106
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,727
which I never have...

1107
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,689
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

1108
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,646
Which would put them out...

1109
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,842
right there.

1110
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,540
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.

1111
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,850
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.

1112
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,286
How dare you.

1113
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,240
Acacia Alley?

1114
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,731
Ficus Underpass.

1115
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,100
South Canyon.

1116
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,122
They're heading out of town.

1117
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,484
Where does that road go?

1118
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,241
Gary, quit it!

1119
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,282
You're gonna start a howl.

1120
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,441
I didn't start it!

1121
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,365
Come on.

1122
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,811
You are a clever bunny.

1123
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,769
It looks like this was a hospital.

1124
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,723
You know, after you. You're the cop.

1125
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,367
Okay, all clear.

1126
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,687
All this equipment is brand new.

1127
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,401
Carrots.

1128
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,127
Claw marks.

1129
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,641
Yeah, huge claw marks. What kind of...

1130
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,163
Mr. Manchas.

1131
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,525
It's him.

1132
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,682
We found our otter.

1133
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,444
Mr. Otterton.

1134
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,008
My name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.

1135
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,969
We're gonna get you out of here now.

1136
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,480
Or not.

1137
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,927
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

1138
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,300
11, 12, 13, 14...

1139
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,620
Not including Manchas, it's 14.

1140
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,580
Chief Bogo
handed out 14 missing mammal files.

1141
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,700
They're all here.

1142
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,566
All the missing mammals are right here.

1143
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,684
Enough! I don't want excuses, Doctor!

1144
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,687
I want answers.

1145
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,126
Mayor Lionheart, please.

1146
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,140
We're doing everything we can.

1147
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,140
Really?

1148
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,140
Because I got a dozen and a half
animals here

1149
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,969
who have gone off-the-rails crazy...

1150
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,685
and you can't tell me why.

1151
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,451
Now, I'd call that awfully far
from "doing everything."

1152
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,806
Sir...

1153
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,689
it may be time to consider their biology.

1154
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,723
What? What do you mean "biology?"

1155
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,770
The only animals going savage
are predators.

1156
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,531
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

1157
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,524
Great idea. Tell the public.

1158
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,690
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor...

1159
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,500
who is a lion?

1160
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,740
I'll be ruined!

1161
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,126
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

1162
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,442
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

1163
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,843
And we are going to keep it that way.

1164
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,482
No, no, no!

1165
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,920
Someone's here.

1166
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,525
Sir, you need to go, now!

1167
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,364
Security! Sweep the area!

1168
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,289
Great! We're dead. We're dead.

1169
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,721
That's it. I'm dead, you're dead.
Everybody's dead!

1170
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,961
Can you swim?

1171
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,964
What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why?

1172
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,811
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

1173
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,249
We gotta tell Bogo!

1174
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,803
Wow! You are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.

1175
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,140
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now!

1176
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,241
Wait, is that Gazelle?

1177
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,168
No.

1178
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,164
I'm Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer.

1179
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,009
You have the app too?

1180
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,526
Chief!

1181
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,371
Clawhauser, can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?

1182
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,722
Yes of course! About that, sir.
Officer Hopps just called.

1183
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,327
She found all of them.

1184
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,168
Wow! I'm impressed.

1185
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,011
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything...

1186
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,845
You don't understand.
I was trying to protect the city!

1187
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,042
You were just trying to protect your job.

1188
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,084
No. Listen, we still don't know
why this is happening.

1189
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,500
It could destroy Zootopia.

1190
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,761
You have the right to remain silent.

1191
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,406
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1192
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,160
Ladies and gentlemammals.

1193
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,123
14 mammals went missing...

1194
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,967
and all 14 have been found
by our newest recruit...

1195
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,406
who will speak to you in a moment.

1196
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,860
But first, let me remind you...

1197
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,041
I'm so nervous.

1198
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,009
Okay. Press Conference 101.

1199
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,731
You wanna look smart? Answer
their question with your own question...

1200
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,929
and then answer that question. Like this.

1201
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,448
"Excuse me. Officer Hopps,
what can you tell us about the case?"

1202
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,204
"Well, was this a tough case?

1203
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,488
"Yes. Yes, it was." You see?

1204
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,324
You should be there with me.

1205
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,925
We did this together.

1206
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,163
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

1207
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:59,884
Funny you should say that,
because I've been thinking...

1208
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,563
It would be nice to have a partner.

1209
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,886
Here. In case
you need something to write with.

1210
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,650
At twenty-two hundred hours,
we found all these missing animals...

1211
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,406
Officer Hopps, it's time.

1212
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,220
They appear to be in good health,
physically if not emotionally

1213
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,281
So now, I'll turn things over
to the officer who cracked the case.

1214
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,164
Officer Judy Hopps.

1215
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,768
- Officer Hopps!
- Officer Hopps!

1216
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,802
Over here!

1217
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,808
Yes?

1218
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,764
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

1219
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,443
Well, the animals in question...

1220
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,562
Are they all different species?

1221
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,762
Yes. Yes, they are.

1222
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,180
Okay, so what is the connection?

1223
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:58,060
All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.

1224
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,289
So, predators
are the only ones going savage?

1225
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,131
That is accurate. Yes.

1226
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,645
Why is this happening?

1227
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,886
We still don't know.

1228
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,460
It may have something to do with biology.

1229
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,925
What do you mean by that?

1230
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,300
A biological component.

1231
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,609
You know, something in their DNA.

1232
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,260
In their DNA?
Can you elaborate on that, please?

1233
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,649
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands of years ago...

1234
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:34,100
predators survived through
their aggressive...

1235
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,884
hunting instincts.

1236
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,001
For whatever reason...

1237
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,600
they seem to be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways.

1238
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,410
Of course they did.

1239
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,580
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1240
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,780
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?

1241
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,260
It is possible. So we must be vigilant.

1242
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,660
And we at the ZPD are prepared
and are here to protect you.

1243
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,260
Will more mammals go savage?

1244
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,566
What is being done to protect us?

1245
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,100
Have you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

1246
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,420
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.
That's all the time that we have.

1247
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,851
No more questions.

1248
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,407
Was I okay?

1249
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,881
You did fine.

1250
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,620
That went so fast.

1251
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,260
I didn't get a chance to mention you,
or say anything about how we...

1252
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,940
I think you said plenty.

1253
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,769
What do you mean?

1254
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,247
"Clearly there's a biological component?"

1255
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,287
"These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways?"

1256
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,044
Are you serious?

1257
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,726
I just stated the facts of the case.

1258
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,406
I mean it's not like
a bunny could go savage.

1259
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,409
Right. But a fox could?

1260
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,881
Nick, stop it. You're not like them.

1261
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,809
Oh, there's a "them" now?

1262
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,651
You know what I mean.
You're not that kind of predator.

1263
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,290
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1264
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,445
The kind that makes you think
you need to carry around fox repellent?

1265
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,446
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice
that little item the first time we met.

1266
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,763
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1267
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,766
Do you think I might go nuts?

1268
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,083
Do you think I might go savage?

1269
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,322
Do you think I might try to...

1270
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,521
eat you?

1271
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,690
I knew it.

1272
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,287
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me.

1273
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,206
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.

1274
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,122
No. Nick. Nick!

1275
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,282
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

1276
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,124
No, he's my friend.

1277
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,083
We can't even trust our own friends?

1278
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,123
That is not what I said! Please!

1279
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:36,963
Are we safe?

1280
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,963
Have any foxes gone savage?

1281
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,660
More bad news in this city
gripped by fear.

1282
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,889
A caribou is in critical condition,
the victim of a mauling...

1283
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,042
by a savage polar bear.

1284
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,540
This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week...

1285
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,060
after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps
connected the violence

1286
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,845
to traditionally predatory animals.

1287
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,726
Meanwhile, a peace rally
organized by pop star Gazelle...

1288
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,300
was marred by protest.

1289
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,845
Go back to the forest, predator!

1290
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,980
I'm from the savanna!

1291
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,969
Zootopia is a unique place.

1292
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,567
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city...

1293
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,121
where we celebrate our differences.

1294
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,725
This is not the Zootopia I know

1295
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,323
The Zootopia I know is better than this.

1296
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,721
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1297
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,167
We don't know why these attacks
keep happening...

1298
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,170
but it is irresponsible
to label all predators as savages.

1299
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,682
That's not my Emmitt.

1300
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,606
We cannot let fear divide us.

1301
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,322
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.

1302
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,891
Come on, Hopps.

1303
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,405
The new mayor wants to see us.

1304
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,881
The mayor? Why?

1305
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,010
It would seem you've arrived.

1306
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,884
Clawhauser?

1307
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,610
What are you doing?

1308
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,289
They thought it would be better...

1309
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,207
if a predator such as myself
wasn't the first face that you see...

1310
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,522
when you walk into the ZPD.

1311
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,926
What?

1312
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,440
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.

1313
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,088
It's by the boiler.

1314
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,690
Hopps!

1315
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,090
I don't understand.

1316
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,244
Our city is 90% prey, Judy...

1317
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,926
and right now they're just really scared.

1318
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,610
You're a hero to them. They trust you.

1319
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:57,086
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want
you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1320
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,284
I'm not a hero.

1321
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,487
I came here
to make the world a better place...

1322
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,210
but I think I broke it.

1323
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:17,524
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

1324
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,127
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.

1325
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,801
Like you.

1326
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:30,321
With all due respect, sir, a good cop...

1327
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,803
is supposed to serve and protect.

1328
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,247
Help the city.

1329
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,887
Not tear it apart.

1330
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,840
I don't deserve this badge.

1331
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:45,802
Hopps...

1332
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,140
Judy, you've worked so hard to get here.

1333
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,846
It's what you wanted since you were a kid.

1334
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,684
You can't quit.

1335
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,888
Thank you for the opportunity.

1336
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,810
A dozen carrots.

1337
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,086
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

1338
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,287
Come on.

1339
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,927
Hey, there, Jude. Jude the dude.

1340
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,851
Remember that one? How we doing?

1341
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,041
I'm fine.

1342
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,646
You are not fine. Your ears are droopy.

1343
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,327
Why did I think I could make a difference?

1344
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,090
Because you're a trier, that's why.

1345
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,890
You've always been a trier.

1346
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,485
Oh, I tried.

1347
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,446
And it made life so much
worse for so many innocent predators.

1348
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,850
Not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil.

1349
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,240
Right on time.

1350
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,090
Is that Gideon Grey?

1351
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,242
Yep. It sure is. We work with him now.

1352
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,487
He's our partner.

1353
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,642
And we would never have considered it
had you not opened our minds.

1354
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,801
That's right.

1355
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,531
Gid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1356
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,651
That's really cool, you guys.

1357
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,491
Gideon Grey.

1358
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,086
I'll be darned.

1359
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:20,689
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1360
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,644
I had a lot of self-doubt,

1361
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,367
and it manifested itself in the form
of unchecked rage and aggression.

1362
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,682
I was a major jerk.

1363
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:33,247
I know a thing or two about being a jerk.

1364
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,005
Anyhow, I brought y'all these pies.

1365
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,847
Hey, kids, don't you run through
that midnicampum holicithias.

1366
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,643
Well, now, there's a $4 word, Mr. H.

1367
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,451
My family always
just called them Night Howlers.

1368
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,411
What did you say?

1369
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,288
Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1370
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,090
I use them to keep the bugs
off the produce...

1371
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,810
but I don't like the little ones
going near 'em...

1372
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,365
on account of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

1373
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,340
Yeah, Terry ate one whole
when we were kids

1374
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,680
and went completely nuts.

1375
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,167
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1376
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,641
A bunny can go savage.

1377
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,128
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

1378
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,330
Sure it did! There's a sizable divot
in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1379
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,848
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers!

1380
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,049
The flowers are making
the predators go savage!

1381
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,202
That's it! That's what I've been missing!

1382
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,887
Keys!

1383
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,286
Keys, keys, keys! Hurry! Come on!

1384
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,969
Thank you! I love you! Bye!

1385
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,561
You catch any of that, Bon?

1386
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,767
Not one bit.

1387
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,606
That makes me feel a little bit better.
I thought she was talking in tongues.

1388
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,729
Who is it?

1389
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,922
I need to find Nick.

1390
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,525
Please.

1391
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,767
Nick?

1392
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,851
Nick!

1393
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,210
Oh, Nick.

1394
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,084
Night Howlers aren't wolves.

1395
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,964
They're toxic flowers.

1396
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,180
I think someone
is targeting predators on purpose

1397
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,760
and making them go savage!

1398
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,446
Wow.

1399
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,569
Isn't that interesting?

1400
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,971
Wait! I know you'll never forgive me!
And I don't blame you.

1401
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,884
I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant...

1402
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,566
And irresponsible and small-minded.

1403
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,571
But predators shouldn't have
to suffer for my mistakes.

1404
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,482
I have to fix this.

1405
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,321
But I can't do it without you.

1406
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,365
And after we're done...

1407
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,249
you can hate me.

1408
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,884
And that'll be fine.

1409
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,368
Because I was a horrible friend...

1410
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,931
and I hurt you.

1411
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:09,565
And you can walk away knowing
that you were right all along.

1412
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,731
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1413
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:21,287
I really am just a dumb bunny,

1414
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,248
I really am just a dumb bunny,

1415
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,364
Don't worry, Carrots.
I'll let you erase it...

1416
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,521
in 48 hours.

1417
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,920
All right. Get in here.

1418
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,845
Okay. You bunnies are so emotional.

1419
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,447
There we go. Deep breath.

1420
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:48,286
Are you just trying to steal the pen?
Is that what this is?

1421
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,260
You are standing on my tail, though.
Off, off, off.

1422
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,202
I'm sorry.

1423
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,806
I thought you guys only grew carrots.

1424
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,681
What's the plan?

1425
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,570
We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1426
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,926
Okay. How?

1427
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,451
Know this guy?

1428
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,044
I told you. I know everybody.

1429
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,529
Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.

1430
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,722
All your favorite movies!

1431
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,002
I got movies that
haven't even been released yet.

1432
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,529
Hey, 15% off! 20!
Make me an offer! Come on!

1433
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,480
Well, well, look who it is.
The duke of bootleg.

1434
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,687
What's it to you, Wilde?

1435
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,211
Shouldn't you be melting down
a popsicle or something?

1436
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,441
Hey, if it ain't Flopsy the Copsy.

1437
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,083
We both know those weren't
moldy onions I caught you stealing.

1438
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,481
What were you gonna do
with those Night Howlers, Wezzleton?

1439
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,569
It's Weaselton! Duke Weaselton!

1440
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,603
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1441
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,888
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

1442
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,487
Ice him.

1443
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,206
You dirty rat! Why are you helping her?
She's a cop!

1444
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,404
And the godmother
to my future granddaughter.

1445
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,688
I'm gonna name her Judy.

1446
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,001
Ice this weasel.

1447
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,328
All right, all right, please!
I'll talk! I'll talk.

1448
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,970
I stole them Night Howlers
so I could sell 'em.

1449
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,003
They offered me what I couldn't refuse.

1450
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:06,968
Money.

1451
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,043
And to whom did you sell them?

1452
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,204
A ram named Doug.
We got a drop spot underground.

1453
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,364
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly,

1454
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,885
He's unfriendly,

1455
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,280
Come on.

1456
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,089
The weasel wasn't lying.

1457
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,244
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.

1458
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,082
You got Doug here.

1459
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,968
What's the mark?

1460
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,284
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

1461
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,124
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.

1462
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,361
I can hit him.

1463
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,530
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter through
the open window of a moving car.

1464
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,608
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.

1465
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,161
Or you'll see it on the news.
You know, whichever comes first.

1466
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:09,323
Hey, Doug, open up! We've got your latte.

1467
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,330
Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now.

1468
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,540
Out.

1469
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,900
Where are you going? Get back here!

1470
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,241
What are you doing? He's gonna see you!

1471
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,885
What are you looking at? Hey!

1472
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,571
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it. Carrots!

1473
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,601
Carrots!

1474
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,087
It better have the extra foam this time.

1475
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,241
Hey, open up!

1476
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,846
What are you doing?
You just trapped us in here.

1477
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,604
We need to get this evidence to the ZPD!

1478
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,763
Great! Here it is. Got it!

1479
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,843
- No. All of it!
- Wait, what?

1480
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,360
Great, you're a conductor now?

1481
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,126
It would take a miracle
to get this rust-bucket going.

1482
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,048
Well. Hallelujah.

1483
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,980
We kinda got a situation at the lab.

1484
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,206
It just got worse!

1485
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,180
Mission accomplished.

1486
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,681
Would it be premature
for me to do a little victory toot-toot?

1487
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,360
All right. One toot-toot.

1488
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,286
Well, I can cross that
off the bucket list.

1489
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,731
I may have to rescind that victory
toot-toot.

1490
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,845
Maybe that's just hail.

1491
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,522
Come here!

1492
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,609
Back off!

1493
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,565
Incoming!

1494
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:40,769
Carrots!

1495
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,405
Don't stop! Keep going!

1496
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,925
No, no! Please stop!

1497
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,770
Do not stop this car!

1498
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,569
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

1499
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,046
There's another train coming!

1500
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,685
Trust me. Speed up!

1501
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,724
Stop the train!

1502
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:20,681
Hey!

1503
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,650
Need some help?

1504
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,651
Oh, no, no, no! Too fast!

1505
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,604
Hold on!

1506
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,730
I think this is our stop!

1507
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,280
Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1508
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,410
Everything is gone.

1509
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,847
We've lost it all.

1510
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,007
Yeah...

1511
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,485
except for this.

1512
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,780
Nick! Yes!

1513
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,087
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

1514
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,927
Cut through the Natural History Museum!

1515
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,647
There it is!

1516
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,009
Judy!

1517
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,043
Mayor Bellwether!

1518
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,281
We found out what's happening.

1519
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,283
Someone's darting predators with a serum.

1520
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,363
That's what's making them go savage.

1521
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,364
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job!

1522
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,204
Thank you, ma'am.

1523
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,163
How did you know where to find us?

1524
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,163
I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.

1525
01:28:55,320 --> 01:29:00,326
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.

1526
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,881
Run.

1527
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,491
Get them.

1528
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,163
Carrots!

1529
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,242
I got you! Come here, come here.

1530
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,562
Okay, now just relax.

1531
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:25,921
Blueberry?

1532
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,161
Pass.

1533
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,922
Come on out, Judy.

1534
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,360
Take the case.

1535
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,766
Get it to Bogo.

1536
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,524
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
That's not happening.

1537
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,085
I can't walk.

1538
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:38,241
We'll think of something.

1539
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,767
We're on the same team, Judy.

1540
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:44,811
Underestimated, underappreciated.

1541
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,082
Aren't you sick of it?

1542
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,720
Predators. They may be strong and loud...

1543
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,487
but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1544
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,127
Think of it.

1545
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,288
90% of the population...

1546
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,681
united against a common enemy.

1547
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,280
We'll be unstoppable.

1548
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,805
Over there!

1549
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,721
Help!

1550
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,245
Well, you should have just stayed
on the carrot farm, huh?

1551
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,926
It really is too bad. I did like you.

1552
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,646
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1553
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,643
No, of course not.

1554
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,801
He is.

1555
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,120
No! Nick!

1556
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:54,249
Yes, police! There's a savage fox
in the Natural History Museum.

1557
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,482
Officer Hopps is down! Please, hurry.

1558
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,001
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

1559
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,241
But he can't help it, can he?

1560
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:06,923
Since preds are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

1561
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,687
Gosh. Think of the headline!

1562
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:25,050
"Hero cop killed by savage fox."

1563
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:29,841
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

1564
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,530
Yeah, pretty much.

1565
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,727
It won't work!

1566
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,491
Fear always works.

1567
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,723
And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1568
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,966
Oh, Nick.

1569
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,686
No.

1570
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,571
Bye-bye, bunny.

1571
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:59,404
Blood! Blood! Blood and death.

1572
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,800
All right, you're milking it.

1573
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,246
Besides, I think we got it.

1574
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,620
We got it up there, thank you, Yakety-yak!

1575
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,609
You laid it all out beautifully.

1576
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:07,562
What?

1577
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:08,881
Are you looking for the serum?

1578
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,681
Well, it's right here.

1579
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:11,887
What you've got in the weapon there?

1580
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:15,123
Those are blueberries.
From my family's farm.

1581
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,641
They are delicious. You should try some.

1582
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,371
I framed Lionheart. I can frame you, too.

1583
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,761
It's my word against yours.

1584
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,091
Actually...

1585
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,926
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia
to keep it that way,

1586
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,844
it's your word against yours.

1587
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,089
It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.

1588
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,965
Former mayor Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today...

1589
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,340
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks

1590
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,568
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1591
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,281
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot...

1592
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,761
claiming he was just trying
to protect the city,

1593
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,401
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1594
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,846
Well, yes. Yes, I did.

1595
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,800
It was a classic "doing the wrong thing
for the right reason" kind of a deal.

1596
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,860
In related news, doctors say
the Night Howler antidote

1597
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,121
is proving effective...

1598
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,124
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1599
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,201
Emmitt.

1600
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,121
Emmitt.

1601
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:22,687
Thank you.

1602
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,484
When I was a kid...

1603
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:31,281
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.

1604
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:35,809
Where everyone got along
and anyone could be anything.

1605
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,123
Turns out, real life's a little bit
more complicated...

1606
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,965
than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1607
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,804
Real life is messy

1608
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:50,207
We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.

1609
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:54,844
Which means, hey, glass half-full,
we all have a lot in common.

1610
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,850
And the more we try
to understand one another...

1611
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,890
the more exceptional each of us will be.

1612
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,803
But we have to try

1613
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,611
So, no matter what type of animal
you are...

1614
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,211
from the biggest elephant...

1615
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,851
to our first fox...

1616
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:18,170
I implore you... try

1617
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:21,682
Try to make the world a better place.

1618
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,361
Look inside yourself...

1619
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,209
and recognize that change...

1620
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,008
starts with you.

1621
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,925
It starts with me.

1622
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:36,208
It starts with all of us.

1623
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,330
All right, enough! Shut it!

1624
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:51,485
We have some new recruits
with us this morning...

1625
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,761
including our first fox.

1626
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,891
Who cares?

1627
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,566
You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1628
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,881
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1629
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,889
Assignments.

1630
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,566
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato...

1631
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,762
Tundratown SWAT.

1632
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,928
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard...

1633
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,082
undercover.

1634
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,607
Hopps, Wilde.

1635
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,210
Parking duty.

1636
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,049
Dismissed.

1637
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,083
Just kidding!

1638
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,244
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.

1639
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,740
Find him, shut him down.

1640
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,765
So, are all rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?

1641
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,166
Oops. Sorry.

1642
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,961
Sly bunny.

1643
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,446
Dumb fox.

1644
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,648
You know you love me.

1645
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,450
Do I know that?

1646
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,489
Yes. Yes, I do.

1647
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:00,131
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour.
I hope you have a good explanation.

1648
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:02,801
Flash?

1649
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,962
Flash? Hundred yard dash?

1650
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,926
Nick.

1651
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,540
Good evening, Zootopia!

1652
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:18,008
Come on, everybody, put your paws up!

1653
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:22,210
I messed up tonight
I lost another fight

1654
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:25,842
Lost to myself
But I'll just start again

1655
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,122
I keep falling down

1656
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,448
I keep on hitting the ground

1657
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,809
But I always get up now
To see what's next

1658
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:38,403
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1659
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,605
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

1660
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:47,004
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1661
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:51,529
I want to try even though I could fail

1662
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:55,002
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1663
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:59,410
Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again

1664
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:03,531
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1665
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:07,366
I want to try even though I could fail

1666
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,210
Try everything

1667
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,570
Try everything

1668
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,605
Try everything

1669
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,684
Put your paws in the air. Come on!

1670
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:37,127
Look how far you've come
You filled your heart with love

1671
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,285
Baby, you've done enough
Take a deep breath

1672
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:45,445
Don't beat yourself up
No need to run so fast

1673
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,924
Sometimes we come last
But we did our best

1674
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,482
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1675
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,401
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

1676
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,605
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1677
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,330
I want to try

1678
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,284
Even though I could fail

1679
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,961
I won't give up No, I won't give in

1680
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:14,090
Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again

1681
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:18,490
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1682
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:23,282
I want to try even though I could fail

1683
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:31,288
I'll keep on making those new mistakes

1684
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:39,961
And I'll keep on making them every day

1685
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:44,688
Those new mistakes

1686
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,084
Try everything

1687
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,284
Try everything

1688
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,330
Try everything

1689
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,643
Come on!

1690
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,770
Shake your tails with me. Come on!

1691
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,241
Yeah!

1692
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:22,000
I'll keep on making those new mistakes

1693
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:33,244
I'll keep on making them every day

1694
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,246
Those new mistakes

1695
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,964
Try everything

1696
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:47,085
Try everything

1697
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,210
Try everything

1698
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:59,001
Try everything

1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,951
Survival of the fittest.

2
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:56,205
It's the law of the jungle.

3
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:59,292
There's always someone trying
to take what's yours.

4
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,502
How do I know?

5
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:07,133
It almost happened to me.

6
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:14,474
Hi-yah!

7
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,522
 Tim Templeton...

8
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,982
Quit monkeying around.

9
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,734
Hot dogs are getting cold.

10
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,152
Hot dogs?

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,237
 At least,
this is how I remember it.

12
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:29,489
All right, buddy,
let's eat.

13
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,491
You see,
i was seven years old...

14
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,577
And back then, you relied
on your imagination.

15
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:36,537
When I wasn't
exploring the Congo...

16
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:38,998
I was a deep sea diver.

17
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,170
 Tim!

18
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,254
Our hero!

19
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:46,672
Don't worry, mom and dad.

20
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,673
I got this!

21
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:53,679
Grab on!

22
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,226
Some days,
i rescued my parents.

23
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:01,437
That way!

24
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:03,106
Other days, they rescued me.

25
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:06,109
- I'm losing control.
- Tim, look out!

26
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,028
 Tree!

27
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,029
 You're breaking up!

28
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,114
Slow down, Tim!

29
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,698
Turn, Tim.
Turn!

30
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:14,283
Ooh! Ow.

31
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,785
 Oh, are you hurt?
I'm okay.

32
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,078
Show mommy your teeth.

33
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:18,913
It was just the three of us.

34
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,373
The templetons.

35
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,708
And three is
the perfect number.

36
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,876
Interesting fact...

37
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,044
Did you know that the triangle

38
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,796
is the strongest
shape found in nature?

39
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,388
I was the luckiest kid ever.

40
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,723
My parents even had cool jobs.

41
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,560
They worked for the biggest
pet company in the world...

42
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,602
Puppy co.

43
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,645
Yes, Mr. Francis?

44
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,604
Puppy co needs you.

45
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:44,814
It's go time.

46
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,317
They worked in a department
called "marketing... "

47
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,653
Where they got to
launch new products.

48
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:57,577
Even though my parents
worked really hard...

49
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,122
They still made just
enough time for me.

50
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,083
Three stories, five hugs,
and my special song, right?

51
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,251
You got it!

52
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:29,150
Hey, Tim. How would you like
to have a baby brother?

53
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,445
No, thanks. I'm enough.

54
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:38,534
 Life was good.
Life was perfect.

55
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,328
But as I drifted off
to sleep...

56
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:43,456
Something my parents said
got me thinking.

57
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,708
Where do babies come from?

58
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:25,284
 The day I got a little
brother started like any other day...

59
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,870
But little did I know...

60
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,956
My life would
never be the same.

61
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,959
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a. M.

62
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,461
Wake up, little halflings!

63
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,462
Morning, wizzie!

64
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,257
 What great adventure
lies in wait for you today?

65
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:42,051
Hmm. Oh, yeah!

66
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,641
My parents always said that i
had an overactive imagination.

67
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:53,813
But I clearly remember...

68
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,941
The baby was delivered
in a taxi.

69
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Huh?

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What the...

71
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,173
Hey!

72
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:41,861
Tim, look who's here.

73
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:49,034
Meet your new baby brother.

74
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,286
Baby what?

75
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:53,747
Brother.

76
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,708
I had a million questions.

77
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,710
Who is this guy?
Why is he here?

78
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:58,878
What's with that outfit?

79
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,297
Why's he so fat?
Why's he staring at me?

80
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:03,299
Does he know karate?
What's going on?

81
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,051
That way?

82
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,094
- Okay.
- okay.

83
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:08,804
Right from the start,
he was yelling at people...

84
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:10,639
Ordering everyone around.

85
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,391
 Oh, you want this?

86
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:16,228
One thing was clear.
He was the boss.

87
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:19,482
He set up his office, right smack
dab in the middle of the house.

88
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,401
He conducted meetings.

89
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,403
You called?
Do you need senor squeaky?

90
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,614
Hey!

91
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,908
Lots and lots of meetings.
Whoa!

92
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,743
Even in
the middle of the night.

93
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,996
I'm up! I'm up!

94
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:35,581
We're coming!
We'll be right there!

95
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,959
If things weren't done to
his immediate satisfaction...

96
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,505
He had a fit.

97
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:48,761
Argh!

98
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:51,597
 Where's the bottle?
He has to have his bottle!

99
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,517
He had everyone wrapped around
his chubby little finger.

100
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,018
La la la!

101
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,103
Everyone except for me.

102
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,480
- Diaper!
- bottle!

103
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:00,898
- Diaper!
- bottle!

104
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:02,942
Dad! I can't sleep.

105
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,610
I know, bud. Me neither.

106
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,529
The baby needs a lot
of attention right now.

107
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,030
Okay, good talk!

108
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,323
- But...
- it's okay.

109
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:10,616
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

110
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:13,994
What about me?

111
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,540
The year: 2057.

112
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:22,002
Ensign t-Rex and I are investigating
a hostile alien invasion.

113
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,478
Whoa! Ah!

114
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,152
It's so much worse
than we thought.

115
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,415
Mom, he's naked!

116
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:01,917
I'm naked!

117
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,085
 Say "naked. "

118
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,253
No!

119
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:08,257
Ah.

120
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,425
Who's mommy's little cutie?

121
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,509
Are you mommy's little cutie?

122
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,012
 No, he's daddy's
little tough guy, right?

123
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,599
You know one of us has to go with
Mr. Francis to the pet convention.

124
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,058
Oh, in Vegas.

125
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,352
You know what? You should
go. No, no. You should go.

126
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Well, you need a break.

127
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:22,646
I'll stay with the baby,
and you...

128
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:24,231
Maybe the baby should decide.

129
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,858
Who do you want
to stay with you?

130
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,610
Daddy or mommy?

131
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:28,944
Or daddy?

132
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:30,571
He wants his mommy.
Ugh!

133
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,531
Okay, we need to talk!

134
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,658
In private.

135
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:35,743
Oh.

136
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,244
Sure.
About what, bud?

137
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,413
About the b-a-b-e-e.

138
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,290
"Y," Tim.

139
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,208
Why? Because he
came out of nowhere!

140
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,376
We don't even know him.

141
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,753
How can we trust him?

142
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,047
Come on, he's just a baby. 

143
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,301
Seriously?
I'm the only one who thinks

144
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,719
there's something weird
about this guy?

145
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,890
Oopsie! I got it.
Uh-oh. Five-second rule.

146
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:06,315
Tim?

147
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,735
Look at him! He wears a suit!

148
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,571
I know. Isn't it cute?
He's like a little man.

149
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,573
He carries a briefcase.

150
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,492
Does no else think that's...

151
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,952
Oh, I don't know,
a little freaky?

152
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,581
Well, you carried lam-lam
around until you were like...

153
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,000
This is not about lam-lam.

154
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:27,503
All babies
are different, Tim.

155
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,004
And each one is special.

156
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,923
He's taking over
the whole house!

157
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,424
Are you taking over the house?

158
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,343
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

159
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,097
Trust me, one day you're gonna
get to know this little guy...

160
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,766
And you are gonna love him
with all of your heart.

161
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:41,934
Just like we do.

162
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,686
All of your heart?

163
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,943
Never. Ooh!

164
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:09,169
Hello!

165
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:12,965
It's time for my three stories,
five hugs, and special song!

166
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,181
How about one story...

167
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:24,476
Three hugs,
and my special song?

168
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,233
Just my special song?

169
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:33,819
Mom?

170
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,487
Dad?

171
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:39,825
Hey.

172
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,744
What happened to bedtime?

173
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,997
We'll have it on Monday,
Mr. Francis.

174
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,999
Don't cry! Don't cry.

175
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:52,212
Hello?

176
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,265
Hello? No, ma'am, not yet.

177
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,560
No, I'm not making excuses.

178
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:09,521
Yes, ma'am, I know
I've been here a long time.

179
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,024
Believe me,
it feels like my whole life.

180
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,033
I'm making great progress
with the parents already.

181
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:25,537
The usual procedure, sleep
deprivation, hunger strikes.

182
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,372
They're very disoriented.

183
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,958
 I've got them eating
out of the palm of my hand.

184
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,377
They do everything for me.

185
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,712
It's hilarious.

186
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,464
But I think the kid
might be on to me.

187
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:38,383
No, I can handle him.

188
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,761
I know how important this
mission is to the company.

189
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,137
Mission?

190
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:45,140
Well, trust me, ma'am. You got
the right baby for this job.

191
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,725
Hands up, devil baby!

192
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:47,893
Fart! Poop! Doodie!

193
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:52,981
I've gotta deal
with the k-i-d.

194
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:54,107
You can talk!

195
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,568
Uh, goo-goo ga-ga.

196
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,987
No, you can really talk.
I heard you!

197
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:02,074
Fine. I can talk.

198
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,408
Now, let's see
if you can listen.

199
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,660
Get me a double Espresso...

200
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:06,745
And see if there's someplace
around here with decent Sushi.

201
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,998
I'd kill for a spicy
tuna roll right about now.

202
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,750
Get yourself
a little something.

203
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,418
Who are you?

204
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:17,172
Let's just say I'm the boss.

205
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,592
The boss? You're a baby!
You wear a diaper.

206
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,344
You know who else
wears diapers?

207
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:24,930
Astronauts and nascar drivers,
that's who.

208
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,473
It's called efficiency,
Templeton.

209
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:28,350
The average
toddler spends, what?

210
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,435
45 hours a year on the potty?

211
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,145
I'm the boss. 

212
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,939
I don't have
that kind of spare time.

213
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,649
Well,
you're not the boss of me.

214
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:36,859
I am the boss of you.

215
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:37,943
No, you're not.

216
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,111
Am, too.
Are not.

217
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,529
Am, too!
Are not!

218
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,281
Am, too.
Are not!

219
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,448
 Am, too.
Are not!

220
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,867
Am, too. Am, too.

221
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,118
Am, too. Am, too.

222
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,286
I was here first.

223
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,538
Just wait until mom and dad
find out about this.

224
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:52,040
Oh, yeah? You think
they'd pick you over me?

225
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,709
With your track record?

226
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,460
You don't know
anything about me.

227
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,381
So that's how you wanna
play it, huh? Let's see.

228
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:02,175
Templeton, Timothy.
Middle name...

229
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,971
I'm sorry. Leslie!

230
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,848
Mostly c's...
How do you know all that?

231
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:10,142
Can't ride a bike
without training wheels?

232
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,313
Even bears can ride a bike
without training wheels, Leslie.

233
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,231
Um...
Dob says you're seven.

234
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,608
Seven and a half.

235
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,528
Power nap!
Uh, you were saying?

236
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:23,155
I'm seven and a half.

237
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,823
Exactly! You're old.

238
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,910
It's time to make way
for the next generation.

239
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:29,328
It's the way of the world.

240
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,747
You would never ask
your parents for an old toy.

241
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:32,831
Lam-lam?

242
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,041
Everyone wants
the hot, new thing.

243
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,709
 Destroy. Destroy.

244
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:36,919
Lam-lam!

245
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,337
I've got fresh batteries.

246
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,504
Boom!

247
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,256
Mom and dad
don't even know you.

248
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:42,716
They love me!

249
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:44,343
Oh, yeah? Do the math, kid.

250
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,887
There's only
so much love to go around.

251
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:48,931
It's like these beads.

252
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,516
You used to have
all your parents' love.

253
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,936
All their time.
All their attention.

254
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:56,188
You had all the beads.

255
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,898
But then I came along.

256
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,942
Babies take up a lot of time.

257
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:03,528
They need a lot of attention.
They get all the love.

258
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,364
We could share.

259
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,783
You obviously didn't
go to business school.

260
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,915
Look, Templeton,
the numbers just don't add up.

261
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,376
There's not enough love
for the two of us.

262
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,711
Not enough beads
to go around.

263
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,130
And then,
all of a sudden, 

264
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,465
there's no place for Tim.

265
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,133
Tim doesn't fit anymore.

266
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:28,553
Oh, no!
What about Tim? 

267
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:34,309
So keep quiet.
Stay out of my way.

268
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:36,186
Or there's gonna be cutbacks.

269
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,607
 You can't be fired
from your own family.

270
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,406
Can you?

271
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,469
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a. M.

272
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:10,762
Wake up, little half...

273
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,390
What's the use?

274
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,643
Arise for
a nutritious breakfast!

275
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,270
It's 7:00 a. M.

276
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,404
Oh, what's wrong, Timothy?

277
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,614
Has that little dwarf
made you blue?

278
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:30,949
Mmm-hmm.

279
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,744
Then I shall cast upon him
a great curse!

280
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:36,246
He shall not pass!

281
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:37,789
It's no use, wizzie.

282
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,791
He's got mom and dad
completely fooled.

283
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,961
If they knew what I knew,
they'd never let him stay.

284
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:46,798
Perhaps your parents
need to be enlightened.

285
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,092
With a great curse!

286
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,510
They shall not pass!

287
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,554
Yeah. I need
to enlighten them...

288
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:54,848
With proof!

289
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,558
That's what I need, proof!

290
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,894
Expose his dark magic!

291
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,818
Testing, testing.

292
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,320
Testing, testing.

293
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,991
Maybe they can
return him to the store...

294
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,326
And get their money back!

295
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,119
We could buy a bouncy house!

296
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,665
Godspeed, Tim! It's 8:45 a. M.

297
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:28,131
Ninja.

298
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,510
Ninja.

299
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,815
Ninja.

300
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,191
Whoa!

301
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,824
Ninja.

302
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,092
Babies everywhere!
They're spreading.

303
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,886
Mom! Dad! What's going on?

304
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:19,057
It's an invasion!

305
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,642
Ah!

306
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,561
 It's a play date!

307
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:24,521
Aw!

308
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,231
That's a keeper.

309
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,567
It's a meeting,
and you won't be attending.

310
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,034
We'll see about that.

311
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:41,705
 Thank you all for
coming here on such short notice.

312
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,081
Now, before we begin...

313
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:45,876
Yes, sir!

314
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:47,252
Sure is!
Affirmative!

315
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,087
Jimbo, run some interference.

316
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:51,715
Hey!

317
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:53,008
We babies

318
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,509
are having a crisis!
Oh, no!

319
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,635
That's awful!
Horrible!

320
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:56,803
What is it?

321
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:58,597
It's simpler
if I just show you.

322
00:19:58,723 --> 00:19:59,723
Teddy, if you please.

323
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,600
Let's put on a show.

324
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,934
Oh.

325
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,811
Here we go!

326
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,313
Jimbo, hit the lights.

327
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:11,276
You see, babies aren't getting
as much love as we used to.

328
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,153
Why? Have we been bad?

329
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:14,279
No, staci.

330
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,114
But I'll tell you who is.

331
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,659
Behold our mortal enemy.
Puppies!

332
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,785
 Aw!

333
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,079
No!
That's exactly the problem.

334
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,665
Puppies?
What's the deal with puppies?

335
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,958
Throughout history...

336
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,127
People have loved babies

337
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,296
more than
anything in the world.

338
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,131
We've always been
a must-have item...

339
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,592
Number one
on every wish list.

340
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,637
Puppies were
merely accessories.

341
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,308
But all that changed when the
puppies began coming out...

342
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,477
With new designer models.

343
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:48,271
Each one more adorable
than the last.

344
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,190
Remember the labradoodle?

345
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:51,524
The peekapoo?

346
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:52,776
The chiweenie?

347
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,611
Try to say
"chiweenie" without smiling.

348
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:55,779
 Chiwee...

349
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,155
Not possible.
Don't waste your time.

350
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,323
We all laughed

351
00:20:58,449 --> 00:20:59,824
at the shar pei.

352
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:01,952
And now it's number one
in China.

353
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,370
Oh, no.
That's terrible!

354
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,288
Horrible!
Yes.

355
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:06,790
And it gets even worse.

356
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,251
Francis Francis,
the ceo of puppy co,

357
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,669
made this announcement.

358
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,170
Teddy, roll the clip.

359
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,339
And we are on schedule...

360
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:18,009
To release the most
adorable puppy ever.

361
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:21,638
We're gonna launch it at the
pet convention in las Vegas!

362
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:23,390
Watch out, world!

363
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:26,184
It's gonna crush
the competition!

364
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,228
Yay!
No, jimbo.

365
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:30,563
No "yay"!
We are the competition!

366
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,065
This is war.

367
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,693
Puppies are winning,
and babies are losing.

368
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,694
Thank you, Teddy.

369
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,904
And if this new puppy
is as cute as we fear...

370
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:40,573
It could put the baby business
out of business, baby.

371
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:41,741
That's awful!

372
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:42,867
Bad news, baby!

373
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,369
What are we going to do?

374
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,871
My job is to find out exactly
what that new puppy is...

375
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,707
So that baby corp
can stop it.

376
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,208
And you're going to help me.

377
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,084
Genius!
Home run!

378
00:21:51,294 --> 00:21:52,252
You still got it, boss!

379
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,211
Yay!

380
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,087
Yay.

381
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:56,131
Now, your parents
all work for puppy co.

382
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,466
So have you learned
anything from them?

383
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,884
Yes, sir!
Sure did!

384
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,219
Fantastic. Triplets, go!

385
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,137
A.
B.

386
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:03,221
C.
D.

387
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,598
No, what have you learned
about the new puppy?

388
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:06,891
Yay, puppy!

389
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,768
No, jimbo! Puppies are evil.

390
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:10,228
Staci, read back the notes.

391
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,939
I can't read. What's it say?

392
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:17,944
This is my team?

393
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,822
A muscle-head, a bunch
of yes men, and a doodler?

394
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,781
Exactly!
Affirmative!

395
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:22,615
Good call.

396
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:23,742
- Oh, yeah!
- nice one, bb!

397
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:24,993
Gotcha!

398
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:29,164
Put that cookie down.
Cookies are for closers.

399
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:30,915
Let's have another show!
No, Teddy, no!

400
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,751
How about a hug?
No more shows!

401
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,501
Boss?

402
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,045
There's plenty of
love to go around.

403
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:36,129
Go to sleep!

404
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:37,339
Nighty-night.

405
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:38,340
Boss!
Boss!

406
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:39,466
What?
Parents!

407
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:43,136
It's like they're having
their own little meeting.

408
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,435
Isn't that adorable?
Who wants dessert?

409
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:52,604
God, this is so humiliating.

410
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,357
God, this is so humiliating.

411
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:57,025
Wait until mom
and dad hear this.

412
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,945
Hey, Templeton,
what you got there?

413
00:23:02,823 --> 00:23:04,032
Oh, nothing.

414
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,492
Hand over the tape.

415
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:07,786
Never!

416
00:23:15,836 --> 00:23:17,962
Mom! Dad! Over here!

417
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,172
Hi, Timmy!

418
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,340
Hi! Anyway...

419
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,052
Flower power!

420
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,641
You can't get away from
Johnny law, simpleton.

421
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Ha!

422
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,022
Fasten your seat belt.
Let's go!

423
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:42,821
Run, run, run.

424
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:47,534
What? Hey!

425
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:48,868
Ha-ha.

426
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:49,994
Hmm.

427
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,663
 Uh-oh.

428
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:57,836
Run, run, run.

429
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,504
Catch, catch, catch.

430
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:04,843
Whoa!

431
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:07,679
Yes! 

432
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:12,684
Oh, yeah!

433
00:24:16,564 --> 00:24:18,189
Let go, you little...

434
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,442
 Oh, look! The kids
are finally getting along.

435
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:21,901
 That's nice.

436
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:38,877
Sayonara!

437
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:40,128
 Ooh.

438
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:43,256
You wanna play?

439
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:44,883
Let's play.

440
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,598
No!

441
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,893
Save boss! Save boss!

442
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,563
- Get him!
- I got him!

443
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,731
- I got him!
- I got him!

444
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:08,072
You're toast, baby man!

445
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,241
Upsies, I need upsies!

446
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,288
Who wants...

447
00:25:15,456 --> 00:25:16,581
Cheese sticks!

448
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,837
Mom, dad! I've got proof!

449
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:27,091
Ah!

450
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:31,804
Oh, someone can't go
down the stairs? Ha!

451
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:36,809
Nothing can stop me!

452
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,028
Mom! Dad! Where are you guys?

453
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:48,196
Hello?

454
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:49,781
Where did everyone go?

455
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,659
Mom, dad! The baby can talk!

456
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:54,494
Oh, can he now?

457
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:55,954
Wait, how did you...

458
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,288
Hand over the tape, Timmy.

459
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,957
Or lam-lam gets it, see?

460
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,792
No!

461
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,211
What's that, lam-lam?
You want a nose ring?

462
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:04,754
It's really not my scene,

463
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:06,923
but who am I to judge?

464
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:08,466
And an eyebrow ring?

465
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:09,717
Seems like a little too much,

466
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:10,885
lam-lam.
Ah!

467
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,845
How's that gonna look
in a job interview?

468
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:13,846
Stop it!

469
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:15,974
The tape, Timmy!
Or I'm gonna rip, rip, rip.

470
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,225
No! Let go!

471
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:18,393
You let go!
You let go!

472
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:19,852
Give me the tape!
Give me lam-lam!

473
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:24,983
Whoops! Too far.

474
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,068
Templeton! Templeton,
let's be reasonable.

475
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:29,153
We can be reasonable, right?
What are you doing?

476
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,239
You've been asking for this
since you got here!

477
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:33,157
We can talk about this
over a juice box!

478
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,826
Time for juice boxes is over.

479
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:37,328
No, Templeton. You wouldn't.

480
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:39,581
Say bye-bye, baby!
You're fired!

481
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:40,498
What are you doing?

482
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:41,666
Nothing.

483
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:46,838
My proof!

484
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,673
Tim! Explain yourself!

485
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,924
Yes, explain yourself.

486
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:51,759
It wasn't me!
It was the baby's fault.

487
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,011
The baby's fault?

488
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,929
It's true! He can talk.

489
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,724
They all can talk.
They were having a meeting.

490
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:59,017
There's something
about puppies.

491
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,352
It's one big
baby con-spy-racy!

492
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,271
Timothy Leslie Templeton!

493
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,856
We are very
disappointed in you.

494
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,358
No, we're mad at you!
Exactly, we're mad at you.

495
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,110
Mad?
You need a time-out!

496
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:11,029
You're grounded!
Yes, grounded!

497
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,196
For two...
Three!

498
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,364
Three days?
Weeks!

499
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:14,741
Weeks! Three weeks!

500
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:16,743
For three... evers!

501
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,702
Grounded?

502
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,538
You're gonna stay in this
house with your baby brother...

503
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,041
Until you learn
to get along.

504
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,293
Oh, great.

505
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:30,465
 It was
my first time behind bars.

506
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,300
The big house.

507
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:33,801
The lock-up.

508
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,054
Grounded for life.

509
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:40,224
The minutes turned into hours,
the hours into days.

510
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,226
Every man has
his breaking point.

511
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,270
This was mine.

512
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,581
It's okay, little halfling.

513
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:06,334
Perhaps I can be
of some assistance.

514
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,922
Blackbird singing
in the dead of night!

515
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,593
Pray, take these broken wings
and learn to fly!

516
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,345
Fly, you fools!

517
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:19,222
Thanks, wizzie. 

518
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:21,015
But it's not the same.

519
00:28:21,183 --> 00:28:23,810
If only I could
reach my magical shank.

520
00:28:23,977 --> 00:28:26,479
I could break us
out of this big house.

521
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:30,149
Psst! Templeton!

522
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:40,118
Templeton, we have to talk.

523
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,285
Go away.

524
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:52,797
Stop it!

525
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,549
That's my song, not yours.

526
00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:56,509
My parents wrote it
just for me.

527
00:28:56,677 --> 00:28:58,970
Really? Your parents
are Lennon and McCartney?

528
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,347
No, Ted and Janice.

529
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:02,807
You don't even
know their names!

530
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,559
You're just trying
to steal them from me.

531
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:05,977
You stole everything!

532
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:07,812
You're the one
who should be in jail!

533
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,858
 Look, it's time
we put our differences aside.

534
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,237
Oh, have you been...

535
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:17,739
No! 

536
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,992
Where's hr
when you need them?

537
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:31,919
Oh!

538
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:50,938
Take it.

539
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:52,857
I don't want
your filthy money.

540
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,193
Look, I told you
to stay out of my way.

541
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,195
I can't!
You're in my house.

542
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,446
I don't wanna be here...

543
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:00,281
Any more than
you want me to be here.

544
00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:02,283
Then why are you
torturing me?

545
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:04,952
The truth is
I'm no ordinary baby.

546
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,037
Well, no kidding.

547
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,289
I'm on a mission from above.

548
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:10,708
Are you the baby Jesus?

549
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,419
Yes. I'm the baby Jesus.

550
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,379
No!

551
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,965
You see, I'm more middle
management for the company.

552
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,092
The company? What company?

553
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
Here.

554
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,222
Take this.
It'll explain everything.

555
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,932
What do you want me
to do with that?

556
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,560
I want you to suck it.
You suck it!

557
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:30,603
No, it's for you to suck.
Ugh!

558
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:31,646
I'm not sucking that!

559
00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:33,314
Suck it.
I don't know where it's been!

560
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:36,400
It's not where it's been.
It's where it will take you.

561
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,568
Don't you wanna know...

562
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,570
Where babies really come from?

563
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,574
Binky. Papish. Nuk-nuk.

564
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,952
Boo-boo. Bo-Bo. Bah-bah.

565
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,412
Chupie. Hushie-baby. Tootsie.

566
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,623
It goes by many names.

567
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,751
But through its power,
you will know the truth.

568
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,676
Come on, faster!

569
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:09,851
Mommy!

570
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:24,949
Where are we?

571
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,451
Welcome to baby corp!

572
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,330
Whoa!

573
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:34,876
No way.

574
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:38,129
- Thank you.
- what?

575
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:42,466
Relax.
They can't see us or hear us.

576
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,801
We're, like,
virtual and stuff?

577
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:44,719
Yep.

578
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:45,845
You mean they won't feel this?

579
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,638
Nope. Nada.
Or this?

580
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:48,723
Karate!

581
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:51,434
Don't embarrass yourself,
Templeton.

582
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:52,518
I can still see you.

583
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:54,562
 So this is
where babies come from?

584
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,856
 Where'd you think,
the cabbage patch?

585
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:57,982
Magic fairies?

586
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,151
No, my parents told me that...

587
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,528
What?

588
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:04,739
Ugh, no. That's disgusting.

589
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:07,158
Yeah, it didn't sound
right to me, either.

590
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,369
I can't believe my parents
didn't tell me about this.

591
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,538
If people knew
where babies really came from,

592
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,831
they'd never have one.

593
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,708
Same thing with
hot dogs, by the way.

594
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:17,251
Going upsies! 

595
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,338
 So how come
i don't remember this place?

596
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,339
 Oh, you did.

597
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,758
But after normal babies get
their pacifiers taken away...

598
00:32:23,926 --> 00:32:25,843
You forget
all about baby corp.

599
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,345
How come you're not normal?

600
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,722
A few of us,
the best of the best...

601
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,515
Are selected for the...

602
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,434
Who-hoo!

603
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,937
For the ultimate honor.

604
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:38,522
Upper management.

605
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,193
This, Templeton,
is where all the action is.

606
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,695
Nap time in sector g.

607
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:47,281
So this whole
place is run by babies?

608
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:48,366
Yep.

609
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,701
My dad says,
"those who can, do. "

610
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,286
"And those who can't,
supervise. "

611
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,788
Your father is a hippie.

612
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,916
What happens
when you grow up?

613
00:32:57,084 --> 00:32:57,917
Well, we don't.

614
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:01,379
We drink a super-secret baby
formula that keeps us babies forever.

615
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,716
Back to work!
Formula break is over!

616
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,301
We're in a crisis here!

617
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:08,970
Don't you know
we're in a crisis here?

618
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:10,054
Who is that?

619
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,765
That is my boss.
Big boss baby.

620
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,892
What is she screaming about?

621
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,477
Well, see this pie chart?

622
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,938
Wow,
it looks like a giant pie.

623
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:21,565
It represents all the love
there is in the world.

624
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,984
I love pie.
Who doesn't?

625
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:23,985
Apple.
Fine.

626
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:25,069
No, cherry!
Perfect!

627
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,112
Not pumpkin.
Okay.

628
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,071
That's a vegetable.

629
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:30,616
Point is, the puppies' slice
is getting bigger and bigger.

630
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,577
They're stealing
all our love!

631
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,746
Oh, just like
you did to me.

632
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:36,914
Exactly.

633
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,083
Oh!
And if this keeps up...

634
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,794
There might not be enough pie
left for babies.

635
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:42,920
No pie?

636
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,755
No pie.

637
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:55,349
So, my mission...
Whoa!

638
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,268
...is to find out
what this new puppy is.

639
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,437
So you're, like,
on a spy mission? Cool!

640
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,273
Yes! Cool!
And if... when I succeed...

641
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,817
I'll become
a baby corp legend.

642
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:07,611
Like super big boss baby,
mega boss baby...

643
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,613
Seriously big boss baby...

644
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:11,365
And him.

645
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,118
Whoa,
now that's a big, fat baby.

646
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,704
No, that's big fat boss baby.

647
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:20,624
This is super colossal
big fat boss baby.

648
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,543
He was the youngest
chief executive infant

649
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,128
in the history of the company.

650
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,963
Was? What happened to him?

651
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,798
Retired, years ago.

652
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,967
But I still try and
live up to his legend.

653
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,802
In every situation,
i ask myself...

654
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,971
"W-w-s-c-b-f-b-b-d?

655
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:37,308
"What would super colossal
big fat boss baby do?"

656
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,853
So that's all you get?
Your picture on the wall?

657
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:42,313
Come here!

658
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:44,065
I'll get a promotion.

659
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,192
The corner office...

660
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:48,194
With my own private potty.

661
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,737
Wow.

662
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:52,323
So when you're done,
you're coming back here?

663
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,075
A- s-a-p, t-i-m.

664
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:56,827
I'm not a family man.
I belong behind a desk.

665
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:58,829
That's awesome!
I know, right?

666
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:00,206
Whoo!

667
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,499
- Pew pew.
- what?

668
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,169
So help me, I will nail
his diaper to the wall!

669
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,505
Have we heard anything
from that little boss baby...

670
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,173
That we sent down
to the templetons?

671
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,883
I don't know.
You're fired!

672
00:35:11,051 --> 00:35:11,842
Oh, no.

673
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,177
You're all fired!

674
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,179
The pet convention
is in two days.

675
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:16,847
If he doesn't come
up with answers...

676
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,599
He is fired, retired!

677
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:20,518
Gone!
Tour's over.

678
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,855
What was big bossy baby lady
screaming about?

679
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,274
She's demanding
actual results.

680
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:30,319
The pet convention is in two
days, and I've got nothing!

681
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:33,364
That's her! Don't answer it!

682
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,245
Ah! Huh?

683
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:40,746
 Ah!

684
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,872
Stress nap!

685
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:47,419
If I don't find out what that
new puppy is and fast...

686
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:49,213
Not only will I not
get that promotion...

687
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,631
I could get fired!

688
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:53,384
Hey, relax.

689
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,761
I'm sure there's other
cool jobs for babies, right?

690
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:58,055
Meanwhile,
two days goes by like that.

691
00:35:58,223 --> 00:35:59,306
You better start packing.

692
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:00,141
What?

693
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,433
Ooh!

694
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:02,893
You don't get it, Templeton.

695
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,563
If I'm fired,
they'll take away my formula.

696
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,606
I will turn into
a normal baby...

697
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:09,567
And live here
forever with you.

698
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,026
No!
Yes!

699
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:12,903
And I promise you this...

700
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:15,489
Every morning you wake up...

701
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:18,409
I'll be there. Shh.

702
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:20,452
Every night, at dinner...

703
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,538
I'll be there.

704
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:24,373
Every birthday party...

705
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,542
I'll be there.

706
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,127
Every Christmas!

707
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:29,461
 I'll be there

708
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:32,214
year after year after year.

709
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:34,216
We will grow old together.

710
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:39,638
You and I...

711
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,312
...will be brothers.

712
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:47,938
Always.

713
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,149
No. No, this is terrible!
I know.

714
00:36:50,317 --> 00:36:51,984
This can't be happening.
But it is!

715
00:36:52,152 --> 00:36:53,277
You can't stay here!
I can't!

716
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,070
Don't panic!
But it feels right!

717
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:57,072
I know,
but we have to fix this.

718
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,783
We have to make sure
you don't get fired.

719
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,618
We?

720
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,286
We.

721
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,746
I will help you...

722
00:37:04,915 --> 00:37:06,123
But just to get rid of you.

723
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,499
Deal?

724
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:10,252
Deal.

725
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,004
Here's to never
seeing you again.

726
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:13,672
Back at ya, baby.

727
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:18,594
Now let's get to work.

728
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:20,304
Come on, come on, come on.

729
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:21,639
Slice!

730
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,182
No, no.

731
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,310
There's nothing
here about a new puppy.

732
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,811
Aren't you gonna do
any work?

733
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,313
I'm very busy delegating.

734
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,024
He drains it!

735
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,818
So once we find
the file on the new puppy...

736
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:35,986
What do we do then?

737
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:37,696
Send in the baby ninjas?

738
00:37:37,864 --> 00:37:38,864
Even better.

739
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:40,824
I'm going to write
the perfect memo.

740
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,159
Boom!
Boom!

741
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,620
Wait. What's a memo?

742
00:37:44,788 --> 00:37:47,998
A memo is something you write
to give people information.

743
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,668
That's your plan? You're
gonna write a book report?

744
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,503
That's so boring.

745
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:53,879
No, Templeton.

746
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:56,674
Memos are for important things.

747
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,218
A memo can bring
people together.

748
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:01,887
A memo can be
a call to arms...

749
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:04,640
A manifesto, a poem.

750
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:07,518
A memo can change the world.

751
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:11,313
Wow! When you
explain it like that...

752
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:13,065
It still sounds boring.

753
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,067
You'll learn, kid.

754
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,235
You'll learn.

755
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:18,570
Wait a second. This is it!

756
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,072
What? What is it?

757
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,700
Check this out.
Take your kid to work day.

758
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:27,371
Ugh! People take children
to a place of business? Why?

759
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,914
Because it's awesome!

760
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:31,041
It's disgusting.

761
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,377
Don't you see?
We can get inside puppy co...

762
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,045
And find out
what the new puppy is!

763
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:38,215
 What's the point?

764
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:39,842
You're grounded.

765
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,052
Your parents aren't
going to take us anywhere.

766
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:45,556
You're right. They think
we hate each other.

767
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,391
Hate is a strong word.

768
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,018
It's the right word,
but still.

769
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:53,063
We have to convince them
that we're actual brothers.

770
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:54,064
Right.

771
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,774
That we...

772
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:57,192
Loathe?

773
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
No.

774
00:38:58,528 --> 00:38:59,361
Like!

775
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:00,779
No. That we...

776
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,449
La, la, la...

777
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:04,742
La, la, la...

778
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,201
Le, le, le...

779
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:09,121
No.

780
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:11,707
No way. No. You don't mean...

781
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,876
 Love each other.

782
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:18,172
I just threw up
a noodle and swallowed it.

783
00:39:18,882 --> 00:39:20,632
- Here comes the choo-choo train!
- no.

784
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:21,759
Choo, choo, chugga, chugga.
No choo-choo!

785
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,803
Hold the train! No! It looks
like it's already been eaten!

786
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,430
Who's there? I got a racket!

787
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:27,890
What's going on in here?

788
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:30,267
I'm just feeding the baby.

789
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:31,435
Um...

790
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:32,770
They're watching.

791
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,105
Choo-choo.

792
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,109
Okay.
Okay.

793
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,571
Choo-choo on that.

794
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:46,784
I don't wear nautical.
It's not even Friday!

795
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,577
Come on,
you're putting this thing on!

796
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:50,829
You gonna make me?
You can't make me, punk.

797
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:56,085
What have you done to me?
Stop!

798
00:39:56,252 --> 00:39:57,628
Get back here!
No!

799
00:39:57,754 --> 00:39:59,129
Oh! No way.

800
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,256
Come on!

801
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,926
 Tim,
what are you doing in here?

802
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:05,010
Oh, no.

803
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:06,261
Hey, what's all the racket?

804
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:09,515
Aw! Isn't he adorable?

805
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:13,644
Oh, I've got one for you, too!
Ahoy, Matey!

806
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:14,728
What?

807
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:15,604
Bummer.

808
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:16,814
 Smile!

809
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,526
Smile for the camera.

810
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:22,444
It makes me feel weak.

811
00:40:22,612 --> 00:40:24,655
Who's ticklish?
It doesn't work on me.

812
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:25,948
Here?
I'm dead down there.

813
00:40:26,116 --> 00:40:27,825
Come on,
everyone has a tickle spot.

814
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,162
 "'I don't think
I'll fit,' said gretel. "

815
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,998
Come here,
look at this. Shh!

816
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,167
"'I could get in myself. '

817
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,919
"and then,
hansel and gretel...

818
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:41,547
"Pushed the wicked old woman
into the oven.

819
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:45,259
"And the godless witch
was miserably burnt to death. "

820
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,057
Let me get this straight.

821
00:40:52,225 --> 00:40:55,352
The story is about cannibalism
and burning people alive.

822
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,270
Yeah.

823
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:58,522
No wonder kids
are so messed up!

824
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,858
Getting along is exhausting.

825
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:01,900
Back at ya, Tim.

826
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,069
You should have seen
your face in that picture.

827
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:05,279
You were all...

828
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:08,699
I'm not used to being tickled.

829
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,242
Once at a corporate retreat.

830
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:11,410
But those things
always get weird.

831
00:41:11,578 --> 00:41:13,537
What?
You've never been tickled?

832
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:14,872
What about your parents?

833
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,876
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

834
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,879
You didn't have parents,
did you?

835
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,423
Tim, I may
look like a baby...

836
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:26,925
But I was born all grown up.

837
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,804
I can't even imagine
not being a kid.

838
00:41:30,972 --> 00:41:33,223
You missed out on
your whole childhood?

839
00:41:35,602 --> 00:41:37,895
You never had
someone to love you?

840
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,150
You can't miss
what you never had.

841
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:10,594
Wake up, little halflings!

842
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,513
 Hey, Tim. Wake up, buddy.

843
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,431
What?
Rise and shine!

844
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,933
Is something wrong?
Am I fired?

845
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:17,935
No, you're late for work.

846
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:18,936
What?

847
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,188
It's take your kid to work
day! And you're the kid.

848
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:23,106
You're officially un-grounded.

849
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,608
- Really?
- really.

850
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,443
Can the baby come, too?

851
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:27,778
I don't see why not.

852
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,906
Yes! Yes, yes, yes! 

853
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,782
Yeah!

854
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,534
I wish I was that
excited for work.

855
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,118
Oh, look, it's my spatula.

856
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:41,875
Ow!

857
00:43:04,857 --> 00:43:06,149
 Yeah, baby.

858
00:43:10,863 --> 00:43:14,491
 All right, gentlemen.
Welcome to puppy co.

859
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:28,547
Wow! This is awesome!

860
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:29,548
And Tim, look!

861
00:43:30,383 --> 00:43:32,092
They have a puppy pool
and everything!

862
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,510
Isn't that sanitary?

863
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:36,054
Hey, bud, you wanna get
a picture with puppy co Pete?

864
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:39,182
Uh...

865
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:43,353
No, thanks. It's probably
too scary for the baby.

866
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,396
Nice call.

867
00:43:46,899 --> 00:43:49,026
Your dad and i
have some work to do.

868
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,528
You wanna come up to the
office and hang out with us?

869
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:53,530
We'll stick your
brother in the puppy zone...

870
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,532
While we have
a little Tim time.

871
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,950
Tim time?

872
00:43:57,118 --> 00:43:58,702
Dad and I know we
haven't been able

873
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,454
to do as much with
you as we used to.

874
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:02,205
So, what do you say?

875
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:05,709
Mmm.

876
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:12,090
No, thanks.

877
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:13,925
I'd rather spend
time with the baby.

878
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,052
Huh.

879
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:16,637
Oh, so cute.
Oh, that's so sweet.

880
00:44:19,974 --> 00:44:21,808
Way to keep your eyes
on the prize, Templeton.

881
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:24,603
We find out what the new
puppy is, and I go home.

882
00:44:25,438 --> 00:44:27,230
You guys stay in
the puppy zone, okay?

883
00:44:27,482 --> 00:44:28,899
Okay, bye!

884
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,442
Oh...

885
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:45,415
Yeah! Yoo-hoo!

886
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,460
Aha!

887
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,796
That's where we'll find the
secret file on the new puppy.

888
00:44:50,963 --> 00:44:52,339
We'll never get
through that door.

889
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:53,924
No, not that door.

890
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:56,593
The doggy door.

891
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,930
But how do we
get past the guard?

892
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Ah!

893
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:06,311
No, no, no. No way.

894
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:07,312
No!

895
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:12,109
Itchy, plushy, puppy pants!

896
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,780
Aw, what a cute,
little pup...

897
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:17,948
Ow!

898
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:19,616
Yay!

899
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,493
 Kids.
Psst!

900
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:22,953
Get down.

901
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,625
All the way down.

902
00:45:30,378 --> 00:45:33,296
I've never been
so humiliated in all my life.

903
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,470
Arf!

904
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:48,645
Hey!

905
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,525
Fetch!

906
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:57,154
What am I doing?

907
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:59,364
Whoa!
Oh, no!

908
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:03,660
Hmm.

909
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,503
Yes!

910
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,966
What a good boy.

911
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,384
No. No biting.

912
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,681
Timothy Templeton,
office ninja.

913
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:25,891
Ha!
Shh!

914
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,768
Over here.
What is it?

915
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:30,103
Ooh. It's gotta be in here.

916
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:33,523
It's begging us to go in.

917
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:38,528
Wow.

918
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:40,572
That's a lot of paperwork.

919
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:43,033
Huh. I thought
puppies shredded everything.

920
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,080
This is getting creepy.

921
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:50,791
I've come for your soul.

922
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:51,875
Cut it out!

923
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:53,710
Wait!

924
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,587
That's it!

925
00:46:55,755 --> 00:46:56,630
The file!

926
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,131
See! I was right.

927
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,382
Ah!

928
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:02,302
No. I've seen this
before somewhere.

929
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,596
We've gotta find something
to replace it with. Ow!

930
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:06,681
You're right.
Like another file. Ow!

931
00:47:06,766 --> 00:47:08,308
Yes! A file with
the same weight. Ow!

932
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,685
So it can be placed in
the exact same position. Ah!

933
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,770
With the exact same weight.

934
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:12,896
You already said that. Ah!

935
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,816
I know I said it. Ow, hey,
you hit me twice. Ow!

936
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,609
Make it a third time. Wait!

937
00:47:17,777 --> 00:47:19,319
I think I've seen one here.

938
00:47:21,614 --> 00:47:23,990
Smead Manila,
pressboard edges.

939
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:26,409
About 50 ounces. No, 49.

940
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,494
Try this one.

941
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:29,079
Wait!

942
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:34,251
Now it's perfect.

943
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:44,094
Oof.

944
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:47,305
Yes!

945
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:57,941
Uh-oh.
Oops.

946
00:48:04,866 --> 00:48:06,449
I feel like we should run.

947
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,327
 I know,
but it's just so mesmerizing.

948
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,372
I kind of wanna
see how it ends.

949
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,456
Yeah, me too.

950
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:22,632
Well, that didn't end well.

951
00:48:25,553 --> 00:48:26,553
 What?

952
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:32,684
What the...?

953
00:48:36,355 --> 00:48:38,189
Thanks for dropping in, kids.

954
00:48:38,357 --> 00:48:39,733
Francis Francis?

955
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:42,235
I see you've met
my big brother, Eugene.

956
00:48:42,403 --> 00:48:43,987
A man of few words.

957
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:45,989
None, in fact.

958
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,575
Can you put your
head back on, please?

959
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:51,328
What is all this?

960
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,747
 Surprise!

961
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:56,666
A baby corp binky?
Where did you get that?

962
00:48:56,876 --> 00:48:59,210
Oh, you don't recognize me?

963
00:48:59,378 --> 00:49:02,213
Perhaps from my youth!

964
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:08,094
  Super
colossal big fat boss baby?

965
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:09,262
Whoa!

966
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,349
He is him? And him is you?

967
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,352
Except older and wrinklier.

968
00:49:17,897 --> 00:49:19,105
That's not right.

969
00:49:19,273 --> 00:49:21,274
No. You were my hero!

970
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:23,234
How did you end up here?

971
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,487
You know what I do
to little kids

972
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:27,072
who ask lots of
questions about me?

973
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:28,239
Eugene!

974
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:29,366
 Ah!

975
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:36,206
I read them my story.

976
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,709
And, I baked cookies!

977
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,420
Eugene, my chair.

978
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:47,258
Now, it all
started at baby corp...

979
00:49:47,426 --> 00:49:49,803
A long, long time ago.

980
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:52,305
I was a hotshot executive...

981
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:54,224
Headed straight to the top.

982
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:56,643
Everyone loved me.

983
00:49:56,811 --> 00:49:59,145
They gave me a promotion,
the corner office...

984
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:00,647
My very own...

985
00:50:00,815 --> 00:50:02,607
 Personal potty?
Shing!

986
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:04,901
I had it all.

987
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:06,069
But then one day...

988
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:08,321
I made a terrible discovery.

989
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:10,782
I was getting old.

990
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,659
The formula
wasn't working anymore.

991
00:50:12,827 --> 00:50:16,079
It turns out I was
lactose intolerant.

992
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,414
- No!
- yes!

993
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,500
I got called in to see
the board of directors.

994
00:50:20,668 --> 00:50:22,085
 Who are
the boring directors?

995
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:24,671
The biggest baby
bosses of them all.

996
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:26,589
I thought they loved me.

997
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,342
But they replaced
me with someone new.

998
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:31,594
Someone younger.

999
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,013
That's horrible.

1000
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,932
 All of a sudden,
she got all the love...

1001
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,767
All the attention.

1002
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:40,770
You know how that feels,
don't you, Tim?

1003
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:42,772
It hurts, doesn't it?

1004
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,984
Yeah. It does.

1005
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:50,196
And then what happened?

1006
00:50:50,531 --> 00:50:51,865
 Well...

1007
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:53,616
They fired me!

1008
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,870
And took away
my special formula.

1009
00:50:57,038 --> 00:51:00,331
Then they sent me down
to live with a... 

1010
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,292
- Family!
- oh, Francis, no!

1011
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,127
Baby corp betrayed me!

1012
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:07,380
And I'm finally
going to get revenge...

1013
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:10,884
...with the forever puppy.

1014
00:51:11,052 --> 00:51:12,218
Huh?
That's it?

1015
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:13,344
 No, no.

1016
00:51:13,512 --> 00:51:15,680
Imagine a puppy
that never grows up.

1017
00:51:15,848 --> 00:51:19,559
A puppy that
stays a puppy forever.

1018
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:21,394
Once I launch
my forever puppies

1019
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:23,146
to every corner
of the world...

1020
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:24,814
They'll be so adorable...

1021
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,316
How cute!

1022
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:31,196
...no one will ever want
a baby ever, ever again.

1023
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,115
The end of baby corp!

1024
00:51:38,204 --> 00:51:39,370
Oh, please.

1025
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:42,332
A puppy that never grows up?
That's impossible!

1026
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,917
Isn't it?

1027
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:48,797
Oh, it was, until you
brought me the key ingredient.

1028
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,718
My secret formula.

1029
00:51:53,886 --> 00:51:55,678
It's mine! It's mine!

1030
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,680
It's all mine.

1031
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:58,515
No!

1032
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:02,393
You brought me the very thing
i needed to destroy baby corp.

1033
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:03,895
No!
Yes!

1034
00:52:04,063 --> 00:52:06,064
 You walked
right into my trap!

1035
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:08,066
You'll never get away with
this! Yeah, not if we...

1036
00:52:08,234 --> 00:52:09,692
What? Tell?

1037
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,070
Who are you gonna tell, Tim?
Your parents?

1038
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:13,238
Where are the boys?

1039
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:15,073
 I told them to
stay in the puppy zone.

1040
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:17,367
I'm taking them both with me
to las Vegas.

1041
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,536
So stay out of my way.

1042
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:23,248
I'd hate for them
to get terminated.

1043
00:52:23,582 --> 00:52:25,250
Ha! They'd never
leave us alone.

1044
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:26,459
Oh, really?

1045
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,880
Wait until they meet
puppy co's certified...

1046
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:34,092
In-house childcare expert.

1047
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:36,761
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

1048
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,305
 Oh, no.

1049
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:44,561
- Don't be nervous, buddy.
- it's only overnight.

1050
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,062
We'll be back
before you know it.

1051
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,314
Besides, you boys
are in great hands.

1052
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,111
 That's right!

1053
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:56,781
Eugenia is practically
perfect in every way.

1054
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:57,740
No.

1055
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,284
Please don't go with him.

1056
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,743
Francis Francis
is trying to...

1057
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,078
Oh, believe me...

1058
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:04,914
Eugenia won't take her eyes
off your children.

1059
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:07,125
Not for one second.

1060
00:53:07,293 --> 00:53:09,002
That's very reassuring.

1061
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,421
Now you see them.

1062
00:53:12,006 --> 00:53:14,174
And now, you don't.

1063
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:18,094
Too-da-loo!
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

1064
00:53:19,847 --> 00:53:21,097
 To the airport!

1065
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,862
It's over. I'm through.

1066
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,198
What do we do, Templeton?
What do we do?

1067
00:53:38,365 --> 00:53:40,742
We have to get to the airport
and stop Francis Francis...

1068
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,327
Before the plane takes off!

1069
00:53:42,494 --> 00:53:45,288
Yes! But how do we get past
scary poppins down there?

1070
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,332
Okay. There must be
something we can do.

1071
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:48,708
Uh...

1072
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:56,674
Hey, it's not that bad.

1073
00:53:59,345 --> 00:54:00,261
Are you okay?

1074
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,724
What's the matter with you?

1075
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:08,978
Ah! Don't look at me!

1076
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:10,855
 Oh, no!

1077
00:54:11,232 --> 00:54:13,149
Without that formula,
i turn into a normal baby.

1078
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,944
You know, goo-goo, ga-ga.
The whole bit!

1079
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:17,111
Oh, no!

1080
00:54:17,238 --> 00:54:19,280
Ah! Gross!

1081
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:20,531
Blegh!
Ew, ew!

1082
00:54:20,616 --> 00:54:21,616
Ow!

1083
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:24,285
I'm a ticking
baby time bomb!

1084
00:54:24,453 --> 00:54:28,915
I'm going to turn into a
puking, pooping, helpless baby!

1085
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:32,043
Wait a second.
That gives me an idea.

1086
00:54:32,211 --> 00:54:33,336
What? What is it?

1087
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,546
I've been through
a lot of babysitters...

1088
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:37,882
And they all fear one thing.

1089
00:54:48,769 --> 00:54:51,980
Now, ladies, the secret
to deep fried butter...

1090
00:54:52,147 --> 00:54:54,691
Is a healthy dab of margarine.

1091
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:55,775
Mmm.

1092
00:54:56,151 --> 00:54:57,819
Hey, Mr. lady man!

1093
00:54:58,737 --> 00:55:00,530
The baby. I think he's sick!

1094
00:55:03,075 --> 00:55:04,701
You gotta do something!

1095
00:55:06,245 --> 00:55:08,955
Oh, the horror!

1096
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,964
Templeton!
Delicious!

1097
00:55:21,302 --> 00:55:22,719
Gross! It got in your mouth!

1098
00:55:23,512 --> 00:55:25,388
It got in my mouth, too!

1099
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,475
I think I'm gonna be sick!

1100
00:55:33,856 --> 00:55:34,689
Swirly!

1101
00:55:39,737 --> 00:55:41,779
There's only an hour
before the plane takes off.

1102
00:55:41,947 --> 00:55:43,364
Whoa, whoa, who.
Let's take the bike.

1103
00:55:43,532 --> 00:55:44,741
Uh, the bike?

1104
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:46,701
I don't know.

1105
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,202
Ah!

1106
00:55:48,287 --> 00:55:49,037
Let's move!

1107
00:55:49,204 --> 00:55:50,246
Okay, but wait right here!
What?

1108
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:51,831
Where are you going?
Templeton!

1109
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:53,374
Always wear a helmet.

1110
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:57,378
Too-da-loo, toilet head!

1111
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:01,591
Ha! You'll never catch us!

1112
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:19,525
Staci!

1113
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:20,902
 Staci, come in!

1114
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,071
Oh, staci!

1115
00:56:23,238 --> 00:56:24,947
Is that you, boss?
Code red!

1116
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,282
I'm being chased
by a killer babysitter!

1117
00:56:26,408 --> 00:56:27,367
Gather the team!

1118
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:28,493
On it, boss.

1119
00:56:29,078 --> 00:56:29,869
Hello!
Hello!

1120
00:56:30,037 --> 00:56:31,245
Hello!
Code red.

1121
00:56:31,413 --> 00:56:32,038
 Got it!

1122
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:36,834
We got a code red. Repeat...

1123
00:56:37,002 --> 00:56:38,169
 We got a code red!

1124
00:56:40,923 --> 00:56:42,507
What are you doing, Templeton?
Go, go!

1125
00:56:42,674 --> 00:56:43,800
But that's jaywalking!

1126
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:44,967
Here, I'll pay your ticket.

1127
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,135
Go!

1128
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,600
Ha-ha!

1129
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:55,228
I think we lost him!

1130
00:56:56,855 --> 00:56:58,481
 Oh, no, we didn't!

1131
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:06,948
 Flower power!

1132
00:57:09,201 --> 00:57:10,201
Huh?

1133
00:57:12,621 --> 00:57:13,955
Mmm!
Mmm!

1134
00:57:19,128 --> 00:57:20,545
Pow, pow, pow!

1135
00:57:20,712 --> 00:57:21,921
Pow, pow, pow!

1136
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,339
Ha-ha! That's my boy!

1137
00:57:25,134 --> 00:57:26,384
Poppy!

1138
00:57:36,478 --> 00:57:37,687
Run, run, run.

1139
00:57:40,315 --> 00:57:41,315
Ha.
Huh?

1140
00:57:46,447 --> 00:57:47,280
 Uh-oh.

1141
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:48,906
Run, run, run.

1142
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,123
Hmm?

1143
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:11,137
Tim, you've gotta go faster!

1144
00:58:11,305 --> 00:58:12,638
I can't do it!

1145
00:58:12,806 --> 00:58:14,056
You can.

1146
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,309
You've got it in you,
Templeton. Now, eyes ahead.

1147
00:58:16,477 --> 00:58:17,685
I said eyes ahead, son!

1148
00:58:17,853 --> 00:58:20,021
Buttocks up!
Now pedal like you mean it!

1149
00:58:20,189 --> 00:58:23,232
Either you run the day,
or the day runs you.

1150
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:25,693
Good!

1151
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:27,612
Uh-oh!

1152
00:58:27,779 --> 00:58:30,114
My training wheels! I can't
ride without training wheels!

1153
00:58:30,282 --> 00:58:33,367
Whether you think you can or you
think you can't, you're right!

1154
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:34,702
What are you talking about?

1155
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:37,413
The path to success is not
a straight line, Templeton...

1156
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:39,081
But rather a wild ride...

1157
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:40,208
Like a ship at sea.

1158
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:41,709
And you're a sea captain...

1159
00:58:41,877 --> 00:58:43,586
Taming a turbulent ocean!

1160
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:48,257
I'm a sea captain,
taming the ocean!

1161
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:52,220
 Ah!

1162
00:58:52,304 --> 00:58:53,054
Good!

1163
00:58:53,222 --> 00:58:54,889
Tree! I'm gonna hit it!

1164
00:58:55,057 --> 00:58:57,016
Aim for failure,
and you'll always succeed.

1165
00:58:57,184 --> 00:58:58,601
What?
Aim away from failure!

1166
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:02,772
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

1167
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,857
Once success is a habit...

1168
00:59:05,025 --> 00:59:06,359
Then it's all downhill.

1169
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:08,152
Look!

1170
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,695
There they are! Mom, dad!

1171
00:59:12,157 --> 00:59:13,157
Train!
Choo-choo!

1172
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:15,910
Stop!

1173
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:18,329
What are you doing?

1174
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:21,624
We're gonna make it.

1175
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:22,583
But I don't have
a quote for this!

1176
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:26,629
Wow!

1177
00:59:33,345 --> 00:59:34,554
Huh? 

1178
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:38,683
You did it!

1179
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,810
No! We did it.

1180
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,479
And all without
your training wheels.

1181
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:51,362
Coming through!

1182
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:52,697
Baby on board!

1183
00:59:52,864 --> 00:59:53,990
Hang on to your diaper!

1184
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,784
Duck and cover!
Whoa!

1185
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:59,579
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold it, buddy!

1186
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:01,330
I'm gonna need
a strip search on two.

1187
01:00:06,128 --> 01:00:07,962
There they are! Mom, dad!

1188
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,213
Hey, not so fast!

1189
01:00:10,424 --> 01:00:11,424
Oh, no.

1190
01:00:13,135 --> 01:00:14,552
Ah, Templeton!

1191
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,137
 Hey!
Sorry!

1192
01:00:19,433 --> 01:00:20,558
Hey, where'd you go?

1193
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:22,643
Oh, no!

1194
01:00:22,811 --> 01:00:23,936
Not again!

1195
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:25,271
Not now!

1196
01:00:26,773 --> 01:00:27,815
What the...?

1197
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:29,358
Ah!

1198
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:32,320
No, no, no!

1199
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:33,613
Come on!

1200
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,615
I think I ate $1.75.

1201
01:00:35,782 --> 01:00:38,993
Excuse me, coming through!
Mom, dad!

1202
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:40,911
Hurry now! Move!

1203
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:42,079
We don't wanna
miss our flight!

1204
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:43,873
No!
I warned you!

1205
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:45,708
Wait!

1206
01:00:47,169 --> 01:00:48,461
No!
No.

1207
01:00:48,629 --> 01:00:50,421
Mom, dad! Stop!

1208
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:53,174
No!

1209
01:00:54,176 --> 01:00:56,135
No, no, no.

1210
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:01,932
They're gone.

1211
01:01:03,602 --> 01:01:04,644
I failed.

1212
01:01:06,146 --> 01:01:07,521
I would've
gotten to my parents

1213
01:01:07,648 --> 01:01:09,023
if I didn't have
to go back for you!

1214
01:01:09,191 --> 01:01:11,567
What? We would have been here
in plenty of time...

1215
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:13,653
If you knew how to ride
a bike like a normal kid!

1216
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,946
We're never going
to stop the launch on time.

1217
01:01:16,114 --> 01:01:18,199
Who cares?
My parents are in danger.

1218
01:01:18,367 --> 01:01:20,993
I care! Baby corp is going
to go out of business.

1219
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:22,995
Ugh! That's all
you ever talk about.

1220
01:01:23,163 --> 01:01:25,623
You don't even know what it's
like to be part of a family.

1221
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,667
And you don't know
what it's like to have a job!

1222
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:30,002
You don't know
anything about hugs,

1223
01:01:30,128 --> 01:01:32,296
or bedtime stories,
or special songs!

1224
01:01:32,464 --> 01:01:34,924
Oh, please!
Stop acting like a baby.

1225
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:36,050
You're a baby!

1226
01:01:36,343 --> 01:01:37,843
 You take that back.

1227
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:40,096
My life was perfect
until you showed up!

1228
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,348
Oh, believe me,
kid, the feeling is mutual.

1229
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,432
I wish I'd never met you!

1230
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,059
I wish you'd never been born!

1231
01:01:56,196 --> 01:01:57,530
Where are you going?

1232
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:01,033
Fine!

1233
01:02:31,273 --> 01:02:32,773
 Would Timothy Templeton

1234
01:02:32,858 --> 01:02:34,608
please pick up
the white courtesy phone?

1235
01:02:34,776 --> 01:02:36,944
Timothy Leslie Templeton,

1236
01:02:37,028 --> 01:02:39,238
please pick up
the white courtesy phone.

1237
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,073
 Leslie.

1238
01:02:42,784 --> 01:02:43,617
Hello?

1239
01:02:43,785 --> 01:02:45,995
It's me. Don't hang up, Tim!

1240
01:02:47,956 --> 01:02:51,542
Tim, I wasn't born.
I was hired.

1241
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:52,960
What do you mean?

1242
01:02:53,128 --> 01:02:55,671
Baby corp is the only
home I've ever known.

1243
01:02:57,257 --> 01:02:59,675
So you're right.
I don't know what it's like...

1244
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:01,135
To be part of a family.

1245
01:03:03,597 --> 01:03:04,930
But I do care.

1246
01:03:05,098 --> 01:03:06,140
You do?

1247
01:03:06,308 --> 01:03:07,516
Yeah.

1248
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:11,604
And the only way to save both
is to stop Francis Francis.

1249
01:03:11,772 --> 01:03:12,605
Yeah.

1250
01:03:12,773 --> 01:03:14,607
I can't do this
without you, Tim.

1251
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:17,109
I need you.

1252
01:03:17,277 --> 01:03:18,903
I guess we do make
a pretty good team.

1253
01:03:18,987 --> 01:03:19,987
No.

1254
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:23,449
Literally,
i can't reach the door knobs.

1255
01:03:23,617 --> 01:03:24,825
Oh, right.

1256
01:03:25,577 --> 01:03:26,952
Don't worry, Tim.

1257
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,788
We're gonna save your parents.

1258
01:03:29,623 --> 01:03:31,207
And your company.

1259
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,751
But how do we
get to Vegas now?

1260
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:36,003
We're gonna need a miracle.

1261
01:03:36,463 --> 01:03:37,296
Ah!

1262
01:03:46,348 --> 01:03:47,598
Follow that Elvis!

1263
01:03:47,766 --> 01:03:48,766
Why?

1264
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:50,976
Where there's Elvis,
there's Vegas!

1265
01:03:51,144 --> 01:03:53,062
There's another one!
Hey! Ha!

1266
01:03:53,313 --> 01:03:54,396
 And another one!
Mmm-hmm.

1267
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:56,232
Elvises everywhere!

1268
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,652
Tim, there's our flight!

1269
01:04:00,028 --> 01:04:01,320
And there goes our ticket!

1270
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:09,703
Hey! Don't be cruel!

1271
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:11,080
Sorry!

1272
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:13,040
Well, thank you!
Oh, baby!

1273
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:14,458
Well, thank you very much.

1274
01:04:14,626 --> 01:04:16,085
Hello.

1275
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:17,920
Hi.

1276
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:19,839
Ticket please.

1277
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:21,257
One moment.

1278
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:24,593
It's been stolen!

1279
01:04:24,803 --> 01:04:27,054
Impersonating an Elvis impersonator?

1280
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:27,763
Get him!

1281
01:04:27,806 --> 01:04:28,848
Humina, humina, humina.

1282
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:30,933
Stop!

1283
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:33,269
The ghost of Elvis!

1284
01:04:33,395 --> 01:04:35,563
Excuse me! Pardon me! Don't
step on my blue suede shoes!

1285
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,814
We gotta find seats!

1286
01:04:36,982 --> 01:04:38,107
Come on, this way!

1287
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:48,576
What is this place?

1288
01:04:48,743 --> 01:04:51,996
This, Templeton,
is first class.

1289
01:04:52,163 --> 01:04:53,247
Why is it empty?

1290
01:04:53,415 --> 01:04:54,748
No one can afford it.

1291
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:58,043
That's what makes it
so wonderful.

1292
01:04:58,753 --> 01:05:00,629
 Hello! This is captain Ross.

1293
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:02,798
Ladies and gentlemen,
and those in coach...

1294
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:05,885
Please fasten your seat belts.
We're about to take off.

1295
01:05:07,012 --> 01:05:08,512
What's the matter, Templeton?

1296
01:05:09,264 --> 01:05:13,309
My parents always hold my hand
during takeoff.

1297
01:05:20,942 --> 01:05:23,569
Boy, the stocks
are crazy today.

1298
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:34,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
captain Ross again.

1299
01:05:34,247 --> 01:05:36,165
As you can see, I've switched
off the seat belt sign.

1300
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,250
What are you two
boys doing up here?

1301
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,503
Oh, uh,
we're captain Ross's kids.

1302
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:42,963
He told us to sit here.

1303
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:46,383
Oh, well, can I get you
special guys anything?

1304
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:47,551
Anything?

1305
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:49,053
Anything.

1306
01:05:50,972 --> 01:05:52,932
Aye!
All right, Francis Francis.

1307
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:55,726
This will teach you to kidnap
the parents of one-eyed Tim.

1308
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,104
Oh, please.
If only it were that easy.

1309
01:05:59,272 --> 01:06:00,522
What's your plan?

1310
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,232
You're not gonna
write a memo, are you?

1311
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,401
Uh, no.

1312
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:07,071
Come on. You said you never
really had a childhood, right?

1313
01:06:07,238 --> 01:06:08,322
Why don't you give it a try?

1314
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,865
No, I can't.
It's fun!

1315
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:11,742
Here, let's get you
into character.

1316
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,327
I don't know.
I feel silly!

1317
01:06:13,495 --> 01:06:15,287
Go on!
Say something mean to him.

1318
01:06:15,455 --> 01:06:16,747
All right,
all right, all right.

1319
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:22,169
So, you went to
a community college, is it?

1320
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:23,170
I don't know.

1321
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:24,171
Keep going!

1322
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:27,967
And you have the guts
to ask me for a bonus, now?

1323
01:06:28,259 --> 01:06:29,510
Ha!
See!

1324
01:06:29,678 --> 01:06:31,095
Now you're getting into it.

1325
01:06:31,262 --> 01:06:32,221
Huh?

1326
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:35,224
Well, blow me down.

1327
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:37,518
Your exit interview is over!

1328
01:06:39,104 --> 01:06:40,479
Hey, that was pretty good.
Ha!

1329
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:41,563
Who was that guy anyway?

1330
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,315
The captain!
What?

1331
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:46,777
En garde! Ha-ha!
Whoa!

1332
01:06:52,117 --> 01:06:53,909
Ha!

1333
01:06:53,994 --> 01:06:54,994
Heave!

1334
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:56,620
Ho!

1335
01:06:56,955 --> 01:06:57,955
Oh.

1336
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:00,666
Thar she blows!

1337
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:08,590
Watch your stern!

1338
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:10,259
Aye!

1339
01:07:10,343 --> 01:07:11,969
 Dodge, parry,
and thrust!

1340
01:07:12,137 --> 01:07:13,512
Sounds like
a heck of a law firm!

1341
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,639
Nice try! Heads up!

1342
01:07:16,182 --> 01:07:17,725
You're fired!

1343
01:07:17,892 --> 01:07:20,394
And here's your
severance package. Ha!

1344
01:07:20,562 --> 01:07:23,063
Wait. You're not
supposed to end with "ha!"

1345
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:24,064
You're not?

1346
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,775
You're supposed
to end with "argh!"

1347
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:28,318
Got it! Argh!

1348
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:31,488
Hey, that's great!

1349
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:33,449
Thanks!
I just went with the flow.

1350
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:34,616
Ladies and gentlemen,

1351
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:35,701
and those in coach...

1352
01:07:35,869 --> 01:07:37,244
On the left side
of the plane...

1353
01:07:37,412 --> 01:07:40,914
You can see we're approaching
fabulous las Vegas.

1354
01:07:45,754 --> 01:07:46,879
Land ho!

1355
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:48,422
Ahoy, Matey.

1356
01:07:57,265 --> 01:07:58,515
Bye, dad! Thanks for the lift!

1357
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:00,142
Okay. What?
Let's move.

1358
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:01,393
Going to the heartbreak hotel?

1359
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:02,352
I'm going to
the heartbreak hotel.

1360
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,395
Me, too!
Me, too!

1361
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:04,396
Me, too!

1362
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,569
We've gotta get to
the convention center.

1363
01:08:10,737 --> 01:08:12,029
Should we get a taxi?

1364
01:08:12,197 --> 01:08:15,407
Darn! I spent all my per
diem. That's more our speed.

1365
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,745
Right.

1366
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:22,873
Excuse me, ladies.

1367
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,792
Can we get a ride home?

1368
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:28,462
Jimmy's been sick, and he
needs his expensive medicine.

1369
01:08:28,546 --> 01:08:30,672
 Aw...

1370
01:08:30,757 --> 01:08:32,257
Where do you live, sweetie?

1371
01:08:32,425 --> 01:08:34,927
The convention center.

1372
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:41,433
 Bye, sweetie!

1373
01:08:41,601 --> 01:08:42,976
Have a fun lady party!

1374
01:08:43,144 --> 01:08:44,603
Chicks dig babies.

1375
01:08:45,438 --> 01:08:48,273
The people of long island do
not know how to make an iced tea.

1376
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:49,775
 Whoa!

1377
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,986
 Oh, no! How are we gonna
find my parents in here?

1378
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:53,946
 Tim!

1379
01:08:54,114 --> 01:08:55,114
Over there.

1380
01:08:55,448 --> 01:08:56,824
Okay, now where's puppy co?

1381
01:08:56,991 --> 01:08:58,575
Puppy co,
puppy co, puppy co...

1382
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,702
Aha! Here it is. Found it!

1383
01:09:00,787 --> 01:09:01,787
Hmm.

1384
01:09:02,247 --> 01:09:04,248
Ah!
Aha!

1385
01:09:04,332 --> 01:09:05,624
But how did you...?

1386
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:08,043
Hey! Where'd you go?

1387
01:09:12,966 --> 01:09:13,966
Not again!

1388
01:09:15,426 --> 01:09:17,219
Come on! I need you!

1389
01:09:18,096 --> 01:09:19,304
I'm back! I'm back.

1390
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,849
What's going on?

1391
01:09:22,016 --> 01:09:23,016
 That's right.

1392
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:27,104
We're gonna launch a brand
new puppy in every continent.

1393
01:09:27,272 --> 01:09:28,939
In every country!

1394
01:09:29,107 --> 01:09:31,275
We're going to
take over the world,

1395
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,777
one heart at a time.

1396
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:38,740
Tim, there they are!
Mom, dad!

1397
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,034
Imagine a puppy
that never grows up...

1398
01:09:41,202 --> 01:09:43,162
Never gets old.

1399
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:48,000
A puppy that
stays a puppy forever.

1400
01:09:48,668 --> 01:09:52,421
I give you the only thing
you'll ever love...

1401
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:55,007
The forever puppy!

1402
01:09:59,512 --> 01:10:01,054
Mommy?

1403
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:05,100
Aw...
Avert your eyes, Templeton!

1404
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:06,185
Aw...

1405
01:10:07,896 --> 01:10:09,354
Hey! What are you doing here?

1406
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:11,440
Mom, dad!

1407
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:12,900
What are they doing here?

1408
01:10:13,067 --> 01:10:14,776
What are Tim
and the baby doing here?

1409
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,237
What are any of us
doing here, really?

1410
01:10:17,405 --> 01:10:19,198
What is going on here?

1411
01:10:19,699 --> 01:10:20,616
He's got my parents!

1412
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,618
We're really here to get them.

1413
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:23,535
Get them!

1414
01:10:23,703 --> 01:10:25,996
Get the forever puppy!

1415
01:10:27,248 --> 01:10:28,540
We've got to get backstage.

1416
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:32,628
 In there!

1417
01:10:33,004 --> 01:10:34,004
Argh!

1418
01:10:34,088 --> 01:10:35,297
Ah!
Run!

1419
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,677
Go, go, go!

1420
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:45,515
Left, right!
Left, right! Left, right!

1421
01:10:49,604 --> 01:10:50,604
Yes!

1422
01:10:53,441 --> 01:10:54,650
 Whoa!

1423
01:10:54,734 --> 01:10:56,818
 Fart. Poop. Doodie.

1424
01:10:57,737 --> 01:11:00,072
Look at all that formula.

1425
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,955
Now that's how you
launch a product.

1426
01:11:08,122 --> 01:11:08,830
Oh, no!

1427
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,083
He's putting them
under the rocket!

1428
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:14,419
Whoa!

1429
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:25,514
Elvis has left the building!

1430
01:11:28,643 --> 01:11:29,685
Woo-hoo!

1431
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:31,561
Mom, dad...

1432
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:32,646
I'm coming!

1433
01:11:32,814 --> 01:11:34,898
 Atta boy!
Go, Tim! Go!

1434
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:35,941
Go! Go!

1435
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,025
Argh!

1436
01:11:37,235 --> 01:11:38,235
 Ah!

1437
01:11:38,987 --> 01:11:40,153
Launch initiated.

1438
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:42,281
I'm launching
my forever puppies,

1439
01:11:42,407 --> 01:11:44,408
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

1440
01:11:44,742 --> 01:11:45,742
No!

1441
01:11:46,911 --> 01:11:49,454
Baby corp stole
all the love from me...

1442
01:11:49,622 --> 01:11:51,790
And now I'm going
to take it back from them.

1443
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:53,542
You should understand
what I'm talking about.

1444
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,962
You got replaced
just like me!

1445
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:58,672
No! I'm nothing like you!

1446
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,840
Bratty kid!

1447
01:12:00,008 --> 01:12:02,592
Let our parents go!
His parents. The parents.

1448
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,677
Yeah!

1449
01:12:03,845 --> 01:12:06,179
You could have had your parents'
love all to yourself again!

1450
01:12:06,347 --> 01:12:07,222
But no!

1451
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,307
You blew it!

1452
01:12:08,683 --> 01:12:10,767
You let that baby
boss you around.

1453
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:11,977
He doesn't work for me.

1454
01:12:12,145 --> 01:12:13,562
We're partners! Ha!

1455
01:12:14,814 --> 01:12:16,273
I'm not ticklish.

1456
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:18,150
Hey! Where's the baby?

1457
01:12:18,318 --> 01:12:19,735
Everyone has a tickle spot!

1458
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:20,652
My ears!

1459
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,154
Stop it!

1460
01:12:23,156 --> 01:12:24,990
Grr! Little brats!

1461
01:12:30,663 --> 01:12:33,248
 Nothing is going
to get in the way

1462
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:35,000
of my vengeance.

1463
01:12:35,168 --> 01:12:36,960
Not you, not anybody!

1464
01:12:37,128 --> 01:12:38,628
Baby corp is through.

1465
01:12:38,796 --> 01:12:40,255
I win! Ha!

1466
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:41,298
 Wrong!

1467
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,176
You're not
supposed to end with "ha!"

1468
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:47,220
That's right!
What?

1469
01:12:47,388 --> 01:12:49,097
You're supposed to end with...

1470
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:50,432
 Argh!

1471
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:52,309
En garde!

1472
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:55,604
You're fired!

1473
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:57,731
And here's your
severance package!

1474
01:13:03,905 --> 01:13:05,614
Take that,
you scurvy scallywag!

1475
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:06,490
 Argh!

1476
01:13:06,657 --> 01:13:08,450
One minute and counting.

1477
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:13,246
Help!
Anybody!

1478
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:17,042
Tim! What are you doing?

1479
01:13:18,836 --> 01:13:19,836
No!

1480
01:13:20,171 --> 01:13:21,713
Mom, dad, I'm coming!

1481
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:22,964
- Tim?
- is that you?

1482
01:13:23,257 --> 01:13:25,217
Don't worry, mom and dad.
I got this!

1483
01:13:25,385 --> 01:13:26,885
- Are you okay?
- is the baby all right?

1484
01:13:27,053 --> 01:13:28,011
Yes, the baby's fine.

1485
01:13:28,179 --> 01:13:29,304
 Who was that?

1486
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:30,931
That was me! 

1487
01:13:31,099 --> 01:13:32,224
The baby's fine.

1488
01:13:33,851 --> 01:13:35,102
It won't budge!

1489
01:13:35,269 --> 01:13:36,478
 What's happening?

1490
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:37,646
Wait a second!

1491
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,106
Hey.

1492
01:13:39,273 --> 01:13:40,607
I know a way to
move my parents.

1493
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:41,942
How?
We can use the puppies!

1494
01:13:42,568 --> 01:13:43,360
 Upsies.

1495
01:13:43,945 --> 01:13:45,153
I need upsies.

1496
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:46,738
But what if you
"go baby" again?

1497
01:13:46,906 --> 01:13:48,949
It'll be fine. Fine, fine.

1498
01:13:49,117 --> 01:13:50,033
Fine!

1499
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:51,535
It'll be fine.

1500
01:13:51,702 --> 01:13:53,578
Hang on to your diaper!

1501
01:14:01,712 --> 01:14:02,712
Whoa!

1502
01:14:03,881 --> 01:14:04,965
Woo-hoo!
- we're moving!

1503
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:06,425
 Why are we moving?

1504
01:14:06,592 --> 01:14:08,009
All right,
mom and dad, hang on!

1505
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,179
T- minus 30 seconds.

1506
01:14:11,347 --> 01:14:12,764
Oh, no! Wait!

1507
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:14,433
Hold on!

1508
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,809
Go, Tim! Get your parents...

1509
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,477
Out of here.

1510
01:14:18,604 --> 01:14:19,896
You've gotta jump!

1511
01:14:20,398 --> 01:14:22,065
Come on,
it's a piece of cake!

1512
01:14:23,609 --> 01:14:25,193
No! No Patty cake! Get down!

1513
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:29,698
Don't cry. I'm sorry.
Please don't cry!

1514
01:14:31,492 --> 01:14:32,617
20 seconds.

1515
01:14:37,081 --> 01:14:39,499
15 seconds.

1516
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,943
Three...
Gotcha!

1517
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:09,029
...two, one.

1518
01:15:09,197 --> 01:15:10,238
Blast off!

1519
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,252
Yeah!

1520
01:15:26,047 --> 01:15:28,048
Hey, are you still in there?

1521
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:30,675
Aha!

1522
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:36,223
Ah! What happened?
Did we win?

1523
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:37,224
We won!
We won?

1524
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:40,101
We won, we won, we won!
We won! Yes!

1525
01:15:41,646 --> 01:15:42,771
Victory nap!

1526
01:15:42,855 --> 01:15:43,855
Whoo-hoo!

1527
01:15:47,401 --> 01:15:48,527
You ruined everything!

1528
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:49,611
Whoa!
Ew!

1529
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,031
It's not fair! It's not fair!

1530
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,241
That's not right.

1531
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,701
Now you're
really going to pay!

1532
01:15:56,869 --> 01:15:59,829
Oh, yeah? It's time you pick
on someone your own size!

1533
01:16:01,832 --> 01:16:02,832
What?

1534
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:06,419
Eugene! You put me down!

1535
01:16:06,587 --> 01:16:08,421
You hear me?
I am the boss of you!

1536
01:16:16,222 --> 01:16:18,765
This time,
we'll raise him right.

1537
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:25,063
I'm sure that's
gonna turn out fine.

1538
01:16:25,565 --> 01:16:26,815
Tim, what's happening?

1539
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:28,567
Mom, dad, hold on!

1540
01:16:29,944 --> 01:16:30,986
Yes!

1541
01:16:31,529 --> 01:16:32,821
Tim?
Tim!

1542
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:34,489
Tim! Are you okay?

1543
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:35,740
I'm fine. We're fine.

1544
01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:36,908
You saved us.

1545
01:16:37,076 --> 01:16:38,326
You're our hero.

1546
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:39,911
And a great big brother.

1547
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:43,123
Oh! We love you both
so much.

1548
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:44,416
Both of us?

1549
01:16:44,584 --> 01:16:46,209
With all our heart.

1550
01:16:50,381 --> 01:16:52,090
Let's go home.

1551
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:01,349
How do I look?

1552
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,979
You look great.

1553
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,364
Well, team, good job.

1554
01:17:16,532 --> 01:17:18,491
Staci,
this letter should get you

1555
01:17:18,576 --> 01:17:19,993
into the school
of your choice.

1556
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:24,331
 Kindergarten?
That's right.

1557
01:17:24,498 --> 01:17:25,874
And if there's
anything else...

1558
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,000
How about a raise?

1559
01:17:27,168 --> 01:17:28,376
Staci, you don't get paid.

1560
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:29,794
One million ziggity-five!
Eight!

1561
01:17:29,962 --> 01:17:30,795
A tricycle!
Skates!

1562
01:17:30,963 --> 01:17:31,796
Candy corn?
Lollipop!

1563
01:17:31,964 --> 01:17:32,964
Deal.

1564
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,509
Best boss ever.

1565
01:17:36,677 --> 01:17:37,886
And you guys
don't always have to

1566
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:39,304
toe the company line,
you know?

1567
01:17:39,472 --> 01:17:40,722
It's okay to
think for yourself.

1568
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:41,723
No, sir!
No way!

1569
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:43,016
That's a terrible idea!

1570
01:17:43,184 --> 01:17:44,559
That's the attitude.

1571
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:45,810
Oh, you're so right!
You've got it, sir!

1572
01:17:45,978 --> 01:17:46,978
You're the man!
Absolutely!

1573
01:17:48,648 --> 01:17:49,898
Here you go, big guy.

1574
01:17:50,316 --> 01:17:52,233
Oh!
You've earned it.

1575
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,572
You wanna hug me, don't you?

1576
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,740
Mmm-hmm.

1577
01:17:59,659 --> 01:18:01,076
Ah! Ooh!

1578
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,328
I'll miss you too, buddy.
Okay.

1579
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,583
There, there.
It'll be okay, big guy.

1580
01:18:09,043 --> 01:18:10,043
 So...

1581
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,420
You did it.

1582
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,756
No. We did it.

1583
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,677
By the way, congratulations
on your promotion.

1584
01:18:18,844 --> 01:18:21,596
The corner office,
the private potty.

1585
01:18:21,681 --> 01:18:22,681
All that stuff.

1586
01:18:22,848 --> 01:18:24,349
But, hey! How about you?

1587
01:18:24,517 --> 01:18:26,601
You have your parents
all to yourself.

1588
01:18:30,606 --> 01:18:33,274
So what am I gonna tell
mom and dad after you leave?

1589
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:34,609
Oh, don't worry.

1590
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:37,237
Baby corp has a procedure
for situations like this.

1591
01:18:37,405 --> 01:18:40,281
It'll be like
i was never born.

1592
01:18:41,534 --> 01:18:42,742
I almost forgot!

1593
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:47,122
Hoo-hoo!
No way! Lam-lam!

1594
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:48,790
You fixed her.
Yep.

1595
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:51,292
She's as good as new.
She's a tough one.

1596
01:18:52,878 --> 01:18:55,296
Well, I guess we both got
what we wanted.

1597
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:56,923
It's a win-win.

1598
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,893
Oh, uh...

1599
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:10,103
Probably should...

1600
01:19:10,271 --> 01:19:11,271
Oh, yeah.

1601
01:19:11,814 --> 01:19:14,399
So, um, stay in school.

1602
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:16,609
I don't really have a choice.

1603
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:17,777
Yeah, right.

1604
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:20,989
Goodbye, Tim.
Bye.

1605
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,088
Oh, yeah, right.

1606
01:20:05,826 --> 01:20:07,827
 He left
as suddenly as he arrived.

1607
01:20:08,287 --> 01:20:09,037
Bye.

1608
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:12,457
Finally,
my life was perfect again.

1609
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,798
Forget about the baby.

1610
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:22,467
Forget about the baby.

1611
01:20:37,149 --> 01:20:38,066
 Oopsies!

1612
01:20:38,234 --> 01:20:39,484
Pardon me, big fella.

1613
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:01,756
 Surprise! 

1614
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:08,930
Hooray!

1615
01:21:33,038 --> 01:21:34,914
 Hup-hup. Hup-hup.

1616
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:41,421
Forget about the baby?

1617
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:44,299
No, thanks. I'm good.

1618
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,967
 Okie-dokie.

1619
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:58,479
Whoa!

1620
01:23:21,814 --> 01:23:22,939
Argh.

1621
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:38,538
 Dear boss baby...

1622
01:23:38,706 --> 01:23:40,540
I don't usually
write very much...

1623
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:43,793
But now I know that memos
are very important things.

1624
01:23:43,961 --> 01:23:46,170
Even though I never went
to business school...

1625
01:23:46,338 --> 01:23:48,548
I did learn to
share in kindergarten.

1626
01:23:48,716 --> 01:23:51,426
And if there isn't enough love
for the two of us...

1627
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,928
Then I wanna give
you all of mine.

1628
01:24:23,709 --> 01:24:25,376
I would like to
offer you a job.

1629
01:24:25,544 --> 01:24:26,669
It will be hard work...

1630
01:24:26,837 --> 01:24:28,880
And there will be no pay.

1631
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:32,717
But the good news is that
you can never be fired.

1632
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:35,928
And I promise you this.

1633
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:39,098
Every morning when you
wake up, I will be there.

1634
01:24:39,266 --> 01:24:41,601
Every night at dinner,
i will be there.

1635
01:24:41,769 --> 01:24:44,270
Every birthday party,
every Christmas morning...

1636
01:24:44,438 --> 01:24:45,605
I will be there.

1637
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,735
Year after year after year.

1638
01:24:56,533 --> 01:24:58,659
We will grow old together.

1639
01:25:00,037 --> 01:25:04,082
And you and I will
always be brothers.

1640
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:05,666
Always.

1641
01:25:08,587 --> 01:25:09,587
Whoo!

1642
01:25:26,563 --> 01:25:29,607
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a. M.

1643
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:33,986
What's the point, wizzie?

1644
01:25:34,154 --> 01:25:36,405
Because it's 7:00 a. M.

1645
01:25:36,573 --> 01:25:39,283
I have one job to do,
and you make it so difficult.

1646
01:25:43,831 --> 01:25:45,498
It's okay, little halfling.

1647
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:47,500
Sometimes,
i get confused too.

1648
01:25:47,668 --> 01:25:50,211
Especially during
daylight savings time.

1649
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:52,171
Spring forward, fall back.

1650
01:25:52,339 --> 01:25:54,549
We don't even have calendars
in the wizard's realm!

1651
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:58,261
There is no spring,
only darkness and winter!

1652
01:25:58,428 --> 01:26:00,721
I'm not confused
at all, wizzie.

1653
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:01,973
I just miss him.

1654
01:26:02,057 --> 01:26:03,057
Oh.

1655
01:26:15,863 --> 01:26:18,281
Tim, look who's here!

1656
01:26:18,365 --> 01:26:19,949
It's your new baby...

1657
01:26:20,117 --> 01:26:21,200
Brother!

1658
01:26:21,994 --> 01:26:23,452
You're here!
You're really here!

1659
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:24,787
Gentle, gentle.

1660
01:26:24,955 --> 01:26:26,956
You came back!

1661
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:30,877
Say hello to
Theodore Lindsey Templeton.

1662
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:32,336
 Lindsey?

1663
01:26:32,713 --> 01:26:35,089
Aw!

1664
01:26:35,174 --> 01:26:36,132
Who's ticklish?

1665
01:26:36,216 --> 01:26:37,175
Who's ticklish?

1666
01:26:37,259 --> 01:26:38,467
Here you go.

1667
01:26:42,556 --> 01:26:44,724
So, that's my story.

1668
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:47,643
Our story.

1669
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:52,190
Luckily for me and my little
brother, it had a happy ending.

1670
01:26:54,193 --> 01:26:56,235
Is that a true story, daddy?

1671
01:26:56,403 --> 01:26:58,613
Well, sweetie,
that's how I remember it.

1672
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,531
But you know what I found out? What?

1673
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:02,950
There's plenty of love
for everyone.

1674
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:04,035
Even me?

1675
01:27:04,203 --> 01:27:05,703
Especially you.

1676
01:27:05,871 --> 01:27:07,246
Just ask your uncle Ted.

1677
01:27:07,414 --> 01:27:09,790
 Hey, kid, I hear
you're gonna have a baby sister.

1678
01:27:09,917 --> 01:27:11,167
I wanted a horse.

1679
01:27:11,335 --> 01:27:13,920
 Here you go, kid.
Go get yourself a horse.

1680
01:27:14,087 --> 01:27:16,881
You know,
I'm proud of you, Leslie.

1681
01:27:17,049 --> 01:27:18,674
 Back at ya, Lindsey.

1682
01:27:29,019 --> 01:27:31,020
Hi there, baby sister.

1683
01:30:24,861 --> 01:30:25,611
 Argh!

1684
01:30:25,779 --> 01:30:26,987
 All right, guys.

1685
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:28,197
Time for bed.

1686
01:30:28,365 --> 01:30:30,449
Oh, come on, mom.
Just a little longer.

1687
01:30:30,617 --> 01:30:32,785
 Okay.

1688
01:37:10,183 --> 01:37:13,602
 Wake up, little halflings!
It's time to leave.

1689
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:17,189
Go and live
your peasant lives.

1690
01:37:18,233 --> 01:37:19,691
Be gone with you!

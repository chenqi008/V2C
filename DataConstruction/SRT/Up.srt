00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:51,628
Movietown
news presents spotlight on adventure.

2
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,133
What you are now witnessing

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,716
is footage never before seen
by civilized humanity,

4
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,547
a lost world in south America.

5
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,849
Lurking in the shadow
of majestic paradise falls,

6
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,890
it sports plants and animals
undiscovered by science.

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,226
Who would dare set foot
on this inhospitable summit?

8
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,235
Why, our subject today,
Charles muniz!

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,400
The beloved explorer lands
his dirigible, the spirit of adventure,

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,901
in New Hampshire this week,

11
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,030
completing a yearlong expedition
fo the lost world.

12
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,037
This lighter-than-air craft
was designed by muntz himself

13
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,078
and is longer than 22 prohibition
paddy wagons placed end to end.

14
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,915
And here comes the adventurer now.

15
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,167
Never apart from his faithful dogs,

16
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,548
muntz conceived the craft
for canine comfort.

17
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,668
It's a veritable floating palace
in the sky,

18
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,220
complete with doggy bath
and mechanical canine Walker

19
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,509
and, jiminy cricket, do the locals
consider muniz the bee's knees.

20
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,935
And how!

21
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,391
Adventure is out there!

22
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,133
But what
has muniz brought back this time?

23
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,939
Gentlemen, I give you
the monster of paradise falls!

24
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,944
Newsreel announcer:
And, golly, what a swell monster this is!

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,704
But what's this? Scientists cry foul.

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,952
The national explorers society
accuses munitz

27
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,784
of fabricating the skeleton.

28
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,039
Nol

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,899
newsreel announcer:
The organization strips muniz

30
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,129
of his membership.

31
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,802
Humiliated,
muniz vows a return to paradise falls

32
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,801
and promises
to capture the beast alive!

33
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,599
I promise to capture the beast alive,

34
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,388
and I will not come back unfil I do!

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,460
And so,
the explorer's off to clear his name.

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,230
Bon voyage, Charles muniz,

37
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,739
and good luck capturing
the monster of paradise falls!

38
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,060
Newsreel announcer:
Here's Charles muniz

39
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,325
piloting his famous dirigible.

40
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,459
He hurdles pikes peak

41
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,588
he hurdles the Grand Canyon.

42
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,594
He hurdles mount Everest

43
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,260
he goes around mount Everest.

44
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,179
Is there nothing he cannot do?

45
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,600
Yes, as muniz himself says,
adventure is...

46
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,145
Adventure is out there!
Look out!

47
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,148
Mount rushmore! Hard to starboard!

48
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,111
Must get spirit of adventure
over mount rushmore!

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,289
Hold together, old girl.
How're my dogs doing?

50
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:36,793
All engines, ahead full!
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,666
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.

52
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,546
It's a beautiful day.
Winds out of the east at 10 knots.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,134
Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.

54
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,472
Oh! There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.

55
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:59,270
Aw! It's a puppy! Ah! No time!
A storm! Lightning. Hail.

56
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,820
What are you doing? Ahhh!

57
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,819
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?

58
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,866
Only explorers get in here,

59
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,867
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.

60
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,874
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well, do you?

61
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,704
All right, you're in. Welcome aboard.

62
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,715
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

63
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,212
Hey, I don't bite.

64
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,094
You and me, we're in a club now.

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,939
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.

66
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,896
My name's Ellie.

67
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,568
There it is.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,661
Well, go ahead.

69
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,083
Go on.

70
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,564
Ow.

71
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,988
Hey, kid!

72
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,314
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.

73
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,240
I got something to show you.

74
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,954
I am about to let you
see something

75
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,783
I have never shown
to another human being.

76
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,244
Ever! In my life!

77
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,544
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.

78
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,918
Cross your heart. Do it!

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,847
My adventure book.

80
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,138
You know him.

81
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,892
Charles muntz, explorer.

82
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,020
When I get big,
I'm going where he's going,

83
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:06,693
south America.
It's like America, but south.

84
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,362
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

85
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,322
Paradise falls, a land lost in time.

86
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,705
I ripped this right out of a library book.

87
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,459
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.

88
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,170
Who knows what lives up there.

89
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,384
And once I get there?

90
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,430
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.

91
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:38,392
Only I just don't know
how I'm gonna get to paradise falls.

92
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,192
V that's it!
Ou can take us there in a blimp!

93
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,240
Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart!

94
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:56,367
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

95
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,912
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

96
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,000
Adventure is out there!

97
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,833
You know, you don't talk very much.

98
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,047
I like you!

99
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,888
Wow.

100
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,217
Hah!

101
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,850
Stevie, throw me a deuce!

102
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,071
Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?

103
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,906
Uh! Mail's here.

104
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:08,211
Shady oaks retirement.
Oh, brother.

105
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,648
Hey! Morning, Mr. fredricksen.
Need any help there?

106
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,600
No. Yes!

107
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,900
Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

108
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,439
Well, just to let you know,

109
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,113
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands,

110
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,611
and for double his last offer!

111
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,911
What do you say to that?

112
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,605
Uh, I take that as a no, then?

113
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,962
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

114
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,631
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

115
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,839
Yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.

116
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:56,518
You in the suit.
Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!

117
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,019
I am not with him!

118
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,690
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.

119
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,776
Tell your boss
he can have our house.

120
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,313
Really? When I'm dead!

121
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,149
I'll take that as a maybe.

122
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,598
Order now,
you get the camera,

123
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,830
you get the printer, 4x optical zoom,

124
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,366
Schneider lens, photo printer, sd card.

125
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,295
Good afternoon. My name is Russell.

126
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:33,676
And I am a wilderness explorer
in tribe 54, sweat lodge 12.

127
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,845
Are you in need
of any assistance today, sir?

128
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,974
No.

129
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,183
I could help you cross the street.
=no.

130
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,233
I could help you cross your yard.
=no.

131
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,979
I could help you cross your porch.
=no.

132
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,401
Well, I gotta help you cross something.

133
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,525
No. I'm doing fine.

134
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,367
Good afternoon. My name is Russell.

135
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,306
Kid... kid.
And I am a wilderness explorer

136
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,207
iin tribe 54, sweat lodge 12.
I... slow down. Kid!

137
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,655
Are you in need of any assistance...
Thank you,

138
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,519
but I don't need any help!
Today, sir?

139
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,051
Ow.

140
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,727
Proceed.

141
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,102
Good afternoon...
But skip to the end!

142
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,028
See these? These are
my wilderness explorer badges.

143
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:35,241
You may notice one is missing.
It's my assisting the elderly badge.

144
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,034
If I get it, I will become
a senior wilderness explorer.

145
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,744
The wilderness must be explored!

146
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,913
Al ar!

147
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,792
It's gonna be great!
There's a big ceremony,

148
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,417
and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges.

149
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,426
So, you want to assist an old person?

150
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,922
Yep! Then I'll be
a senior wilderness explorer.

151
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,268
You ever heard of a snipe?
Snipe?

152
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,391
Bird. Beady eyes.

153
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,433
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

154
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:14,281
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.
If only someone could help me.

155
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,738
Me, me! I'll do it!
I don't know. It's awfully crafty.

156
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,786
You'd have to clap your hands
three times to lure it in.

157
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,655
I'll find him, Mr. fredricksen!

158
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,124
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past...

159
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,290
Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.

160
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,248
Here, snipey, snipey.

161
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,961
Bring it back here when you find it.

162
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,129
Snipe!

163
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,902
Okay, keep her coming.
Keep coming.

164
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,465
And stop. Stop. Stop!

165
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,178
Why... hey! Hey, you!

166
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,833
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

167
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,314
I am so sorry, sir.
Don't touch that!

168
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,004
No, no, no.
Let me take care of that for you.

169
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,144
Get away from our mailbox!
Hey. Sir, I...

170
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,687
I don't want you to touch it!

171
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:55,824
Ow!

172
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,660
Steve, you all right?

173
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,862
Sorry,
Mr. fredricksen.

174
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,204
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.

175
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:53,372
The guys from shady oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?

176
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,682
What do I do now, Ellie?

177
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,149
Morning, gentlemen.

178
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,156
Good morning, Mr. fredricksen.
You ready to go?

179
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,364
Ready as I'll ever be.

180
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,828
Would you do me a favor
and take this?

181
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,206
I'll meet you at the Van in just a minute.

182
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:56,623
I wanna say one last goodbye
to the old place.

183
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,497
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

184
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:06,129
That's typical. He's probably
going to the bathroom for the 80th time.

185
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,845
You think he'd take better
care of his house.

186
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:56,137
So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard
from paradise falls!

187
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,446
Heh!

188
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,902
We're on our way, Ellie.

189
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,821
Huh?

190
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,055
Hi, Mr. fredricksen. It's me, Russell.

191
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,136
What are you doing out here, kid?

192
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,974
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch,

193
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:50,903
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.

194
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,410
Please let me in.

195
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,074
No.

196
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,835
Oh, alright, you can come...

197
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,049
Huh.

198
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,266
I've never been
in a floating house before.

199
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,889
Goggles. Look at this stuff.
Wow! You're going on a trip?

200
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,692
Paradise falls, a land lost in time.

201
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,590
You're going to south America,
Mr. fredricksen?

202
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,445
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

203
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,611
You know, most people take a plane,

204
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,035
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.

205
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,080
Whoa.
Is this how you steer your house?

206
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,581
Does it really work?

207
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,079
Kid, would you stop with the...

208
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,773
This makes it go right.
Let go of that...

209
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,288
And that way's left.
Knock it off!

210
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,423
Hey, look! Buildings.

211
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,427
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.

212
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,758
Wow! This is great!

213
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,306
You should try this, Mr. fredricksen.

214
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,806
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

215
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,438
Hey! I can see your house from here.

216
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,319
Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!

217
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,986
Well, that's not gonna work.

218
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,323
I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus.

219
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,493
Did you know that

220
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,246
the cumulonimbus forms

221
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,935
when warm air rises over cool air?

222
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,247
Stayed up all night
blowing up balloons... for what?

223
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,482
And that's how we get lightning.

224
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,962
That's nice, kid.
Mr. fredricksen?

225
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,278
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.

226
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,920
We're gonna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble...

227
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,840
What are you doing over there?
Look.

228
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,649
See? Cumulonimbus.

229
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,724
My pack!

230
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,905
Got ya!

231
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,894
I thought you were dead.

232
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,069
What happened?

233
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,576
I steered us. I did. I steered the house.

234
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,737
Steered us?

235
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,576
After you tied your stuff down,
you took a nap.

236
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,708
So I went ahead
and steered us down here.

237
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,497
Yeah. Sure.

238
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,474
Can't tell where we are.

239
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,594
Oh, we're in south America, all right.

240
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:55,310
It was a cinch
with my wilderness explorer GPS.

241
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,100
Gp... what?
My dad gave it to me.

242
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,485
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.

243
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,316
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

244
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,992
Oops.

245
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,958
We'll get you down, find a bus stop,

246
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,086
you just tell the man
you wanna go back to your mother.

247
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,836
Sure, but I don't think
they have buses in paradise falls.

248
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,342
There. That ought to do it.

249
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,263
Here, I'll give you
some change for bus fare.

250
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,842
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

251
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,600
Whoa. That's gonna be
like a billion transfers

252
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,352
to get back to my house.

253
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,823
Mr. fredricksen, how much longer?

254
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,702
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.

255
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,157
That thing was... building or something.

256
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,661
What was that, Mr. fredricksen?

257
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,046
We can't be close to the ground yet.

258
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,890
Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!

259
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,685
Wait, wait. Wait!

260
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,856
Russell, hang on! Hey!
Whoa! Whoa!

261
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,572
Walk back. Walk back.
Okay.

262
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,532
Come on. Come on.

263
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,924
Where... where are we?

264
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,762
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. fredricksen.

265
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,599
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

266
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,422
There it is.

267
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,994
Ellie, it's so beautiful.

268
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,956
We made it.

269
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,795
We made it! Russell! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!

270
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,300
You mean, assist you?

271
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,631
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
Okay. I'll climb up.

272
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,343
Sorry.

273
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,818
Now, when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up!

274
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,157
Got it?

275
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,951
You on the porch yet?

276
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,376
What? That's it?

277
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:54,053
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?

278
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:56,839
Great.

279
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:05,564
Hey, if I could assist you over there,
would you sign off on my badge?

280
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:10,857
What are you talking about?
We could walk your house to the falls.

281
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,524
Walk it?
Yeah! After all, we weigh it down.

282
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,909
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.

283
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,496
Now, we're gonna walk
to the falls quickly and quietly

284
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,203
with no rap music or flashdancing.
Uh-huh.

285
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:33,092
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.

286
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,677
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens...

287
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,096
Sand.
We're not getting to the falls.

288
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,048
I found sand!

289
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,599
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.

290
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,601
This is fun already, isn't it?

291
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:55,565
By the time we get there,
you're gonna feel so assisted.

292
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,284
Oh, Mr. fredricksen,
if we happen to get separated,

293
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,528
use the wilderness explorer call.

294
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,614
Al ar!

295
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,583
Wait. Why are we going
to paradise falls again?

296
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,745
Hey, let's play a game.

297
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:13,040
It's called
see who can be quiet the longest.”

298
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,967
Cool!
My mom loves that game!

299
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,822
Darn thing!

300
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,534
Come on, Russell.
Would you hurry it up?

301
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,865
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

302
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,491
Which knee?

303
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,542
My elbow hurts,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

304
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,381
I asked you about that five minutes ago.

305
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,673
Well, I didn't have to go then!

306
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:47,134
I don't wanna walk
anymore. Can we stop?

307
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,345
Russell, if you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

308
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,858
There are no tigers in south America.
Zoology.

309
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,147
Oh, for the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

310
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,402
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.

311
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,029
I've always wanted to try this.

312
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,242
Mr. fredricksen,

313
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,374
am I supposed to dig the hole
before or after?

314
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,001
None of my concern!

315
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,593
Oh. It's before!

316
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,261
Bah! La la la la lal

317
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,720
huh?

318
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,015
Tracks?

319
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,350
Snipe.

320
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,898
Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.

321
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,688
Snipe.

322
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:43,864
Huh?

323
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:04,215
Ha! Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe.

324
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,969
I am a wilderness explorer,
so I'm a friend to all of nature.

325
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,267
Want some more?

326
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,941
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.

327
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:24,485
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

328
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,236
Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice...

329
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,239
Giant snipe.

330
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,163
I found the snipe!
Oh! Did you?

331
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,795
Are they tall?
Oh, yes, they're very tall.

332
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,919
Do they have a lot of colors?
They do, indeed!

333
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,764
Do they like chocolate?
Oh, yes... chocolate?

334
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,349
Gah! What is that thing?
It's a snipe!

335
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,476
There's no such thing as a snipe!

336
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,267
But you said snipes eat your... whoa!
Hey!

337
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,358
Go on! Get out of herel go on!

338
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,990
Whoa!

339
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,283
Whoa!

340
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,370
Careful, Russell!

341
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:20,371
Hey, look, Mr. fredricksen.
It likes me. Whoa!

342
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,715
Russell!
No, stop! That tickles.

343
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,964
Get out of here! Go on! Get!

344
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:39,143
Uh-oh. No, no, no! Kevin!
It's okay. Mr. fredricksen is nice.

345
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,400
Kevin?
Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.

346
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,731
Beat itl vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!

347
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,237
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

348
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,031
Go on! Beat it!

349
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,584
Can we keep him? Please?

350
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,588
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.

351
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,759
No.

352
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:14,091
An explorer is a friend to all,
be it plants or fish or tiny mole.

353
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,926
That doesn't even rhyme.
Yeah, it does.

354
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,933
Hey, look. Kevin. What?

355
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:24,101
Get down! You're not allowed up there!

356
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,939
You come down here right now!

357
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,116
Sheesh!

358
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,282
Can you believe this, Ellie?

359
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,450
Ellie?

360
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,200
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?

361
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,127
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

362
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,588
She said for you to let me.

363
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,464
But I told him no. I told you no!

364
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,962
N-0.

365
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,143
I see you back there.

366
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,987
Go on! Get out of here! Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.

367
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,654
Hey, are you okay over there?

368
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,903
Uh... hello?

369
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,287
Oh!

370
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,119
Hello, sir! Thank goodness.

371
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,630
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

372
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,461
I can smell you.

373
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,173
What? You can smell us?

374
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,639
I can smell you.

375
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,022
Hey.

376
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,521
You were talking to a rock.

377
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,691
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.

378
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,774
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.

379
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,194
It is a dog! What?

380
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,205
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.

381
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,871
Hey, I like dogs.

382
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,619
We have your dog!

383
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,039
Whoa!
Wonder who he belongs to.

384
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,713
Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained. Shake.

385
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,134
Uh-huh.

386
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,222
Speak.
Hi, there.

387
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,215
Did that dog just say hi, there?

388
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,512
Oh, yes.

389
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,642
My name is dug.
I have just met you, and I love you.

390
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,066
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master,

391
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,687
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

392
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,906
My master is good and smart.

393
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,070
It's not possible.

394
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,660
Oh, it is,
because my master is smart.

395
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,907
Cool! What do these do, boy?
Hey, would you...

396
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,081
I use that collar...

397
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,585
10 talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.

398
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,081
Russell, don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!

399
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,502
I am a great tracker.

400
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,676
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.

401
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,878
Have you seen a bird?

402
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,217
I want to find one,
and I've been on the scent.

403
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,428
I am a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

404
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,268
Hey, that is the bird.

405
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,264
I have never seen one up close,
but this is the bird.

406
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,891
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

407
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,937
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

408
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,108
I can bark.

409
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,447
And here's howling.

410
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,204
Can we keep him?
Please, please, please!

411
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,455
No.
But it's a talking dog!

412
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:31,125
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.

413
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,622
Please be my prisoner.

414
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,292
Oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner!

415
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,305
Oh! Here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!

416
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,724
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What is this?

417
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,643
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

418
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:50,232
I'm getting prunes
and denture cream! Who are they?

419
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,646
Oh, man,
master will not be pleased.

420
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,771
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right, Alpha?

421
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,635
No.

422
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,492
Soon enough the bird
will be ours yet again.

423
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,657
Find the scent, my compadres,

424
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,488
and you too shall
have much rewardings

425
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,332
from master for the toil factor
you wage.

426
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,124
Hey, Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

427
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,413
You must've bumped it.

428
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,794
Yeah,
your voice sounds funny!

429
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,681
Beta! Gamma!
Mayhaps you desire to... squirrel!

430
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,802
Mayhaps you desire
to challenge the ranking

431
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,471
that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning.

432
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:34,313
No, no, no. But maybe
dug would. You might wanna ask him.

433
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:40,239
Yeah. I wonder if he's found
the bird on his very special mission.

434
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,408
Do not mention dug
fo me at this time.

435
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:47,739
His fool's errand will keep him
most occupied. Most occupied indeed.

436
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,877
Do you not agree with that
which I am saying to you now?

437
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:57,253
Sure, but the second master
finds out you sent dug out by himself,

438
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,924
none of us will get a treat.

439
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,136
You are wise,
my trusted lieutenant.

440
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,515
This is Alpha calling dug.
Come in, dug.

441
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:09,435
Hi, Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds funny.

442
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,605
I know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?

443
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,434
Why, yes.
The bird is my prisoner now.

444
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:16,984
Yeah, right!

445
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,771
Impossible! Where are you?

446
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,277
I am here with the bird,

447
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,110
and I will bring it back,
and then you will like me.

448
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,616
He 5 soft, dug, who s
on 0 you talking king to?

449
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,618
No, wait, wait!
What's dug doing?

450
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,540
Why's he with
that small mailman?

451
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,242
Where are they?

452
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,629
There he is. Come on!

453
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,970
Oh, please, oh, please,
oh, please be my prisoner.

454
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,467
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

455
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,470
That man there says
I can take the bird,

456
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,373
and I love that man there
like he is my master.

457
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,477
I am not your master!

458
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,101
I am warning you
once again, bird.

459
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,253
Hey! Quit it!
I am jumping on you now, bird.

460
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,563
Russell, at this rate,
we'll never get to the falls.

461
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,985
Here, bird.

462
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,866
I am nobody's master, got it?

463
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,414
I don't want you here,
and I don't want you here!

464
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,786
I'm stuck with you!

465
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,607
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

466
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,168
A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy!
A ball!

467
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,671
Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?

468
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,631
Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?

469
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,758
Yes, I do!
I do ever so want the ball.

470
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,305
Go get it!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

471
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,223
I will get it and then bring it back!

472
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,847
Quick, Russell.
Give me some chocolate.

473
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,974
Why?
Just give it to me!

474
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,805
Bird. Bird!

475
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,980
Come on, Russell.

476
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,687
Wait, wait, Mr. fredricksen.

477
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,618
What are we doing?

478
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,832
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

479
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,469
I think that did the trick.

480
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,714
Hi, master.

481
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,890
Afternoon.

482
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,578
Well, thanks for keeping us
dry anyway, Ellie.

483
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,538
Which one's the front?

484
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,424
Oh, boy.

485
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:49,220
Is this step three or step five?

486
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,757
There.

487
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:59,063
All done! That's for you.

488
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,486
Oh...

489
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,064
Tents are hard.

490
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:13,869
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,
with the gpms and the badges?

491
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,666
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

492
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,086
No.
All right. Here it goes.

493
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,131
I never actually built a tent before.
There, I said it.

494
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,835
You've been camping before,
haven't you?

495
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,386
Well, never outside.

496
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:35,304
Well, why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?

497
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,603
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff

498
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,305
well, why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.

499
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,732
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.

500
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,434
He's gotta be home sometime.

501
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,772
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

502
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,280
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

503
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,532
Phyllis isn't my mom.

504
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,827
Oh.

505
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,092
But he promised
he'd come to my explorer ceremony

506
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,966
to pin on
my assisting the elderly badge.

507
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,178
So, he can show me
about tents then, right?

508
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,350
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?

509
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:30,272
Don't wanna wake up
the traveling flea circus.

510
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,816
Mr. fredricksen?

511
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,778
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.

512
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,621
We have to protect him.

513
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,872
Can Kevin go with us?

514
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,417
All right, he can come.

515
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,208
Promise you won't leave him?

516
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,835
Yeah.
Cross your heart?

517
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,933
Cross my heart.

518
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,978
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

519
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,920
Morning, sweetheart.

520
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,681
We better get moving.

521
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,727
Bird's gone.

522
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,398
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right, everybody up!

523
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:52,695
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

524
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,615
Find the bird, find the bird!
Hi, hi. Point!

525
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,567
Look. There he is!

526
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,158
Point!

527
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,204
Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof

528
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:07,535
Yeah, get off of his...

529
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,215
What is it doing?

530
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,715
The bird is calling to her babies.

531
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,304
Her babies.

532
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,220
Kevin's a girl?

533
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,347
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.

534
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:32,026
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.

535
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,941
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?

536
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,026
But you promised to protect her.

537
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,408
Her babies need her.
We gotta make sure they're together!

538
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:46,536
Sorry, Russell.
We've lost enough time already.

539
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,118
Yeah.

540
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,511
This was her favorite chocolate.

541
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,179
Because you sent her away,
there's more for you.

542
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,889
Huh?

543
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,141
Kevin?

544
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,746
Where's the bird?
You said you had the bird.

545
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,043
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

546
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,167
Since I have said that,
I can see how you would think that.

547
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:37,341
Where is it?
Uh... tomorrow.

548
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:41,296
Come back tomorrow, and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.

549
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:46,221
You lost it!
Why do I not have a surprised feeling?

550
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,012
Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman

551
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,598
and the one who smells of prunes.

552
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,769
Master will be most pleased
we have found them

553
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,776
and will ask of them many questions.
Come!

554
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:03,405
Wait. We're not going with you!
We're going to the falls!

555
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,029
Get away from me!

556
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,167
Get down!

557
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,597
Stay!

558
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,400
You came here in that?

559
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,144
Uh, yeah.

560
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:24,740
In a house? A floating house?

561
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:36,085
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.

562
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:39,209
You're not after my bird, are you?
, y

563
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,170
but if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar,

564
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,502
I'd be happy to oblige.

565
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,473
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

566
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,767
My dogs made a mistake.

567
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,767
Wait. Are you Charles muntz?

568
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,474
Yeah, well, yes.

569
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,685
The Charles muntz?

570
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,982
Adventure is out there!

571
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,611
it's really him! That's Charles muntz!

572
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,277
It is? Who's Charles muntz?
Him!

573
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,267
Yes! Yes! That's him!
=I'm Carl fredricksen.

574
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:15,124
My wife and I,
we were your biggest fans.

575
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,950
Oh, well. You're a man of good taste.

576
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:21,459
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?

577
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,585
Uh-huh.

578
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,132
Now, attention, everyone!

579
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,053
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.

580
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,633
Follow me.
I like you temporarily.

581
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,434
You do smell like prunes.

582
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,556
Whoa!

583
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,306
I will not bite you.

584
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,857
The small mailman
smells like chocolate.

585
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,273
I'm sorry about the dogs.

586
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,356
Hope they weren't too rough on you.
We weren't.

587
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,909
Go ahead and moor
your airship right next to mine.

588
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:00,127
We're not actually going inside
the spirit of adventure itself?

589
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,249
Oh...

590
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,088
Would you like to?

591
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,415
Would 1?

592
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,418
Wait up, Mr. muntz.

593
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,800
Jiminy cricket.

594
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,177
Not you.
What do we do with dug?

595
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:17,011
He has lost the bird.
But him in the cone of shame.

596
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,317
I do not like the cone of shame.

597
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:29,940
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

598
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:33,778
New York, Munich, London.
Of course, I kept the best for myself.

599
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,997
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

600
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,575
Oh, yes, the arsinoitherium.

601
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,377
Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth.

602
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,206
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.

603
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,006
Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me.

604
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,506
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time

605
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,554
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.

606
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:56,342
Oh, my gosh!
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!

607
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,303
Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed.

608
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,684
That's an interesting story there.

609
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,815
Excellent choice.

610
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:07,690
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.

611
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,649
He and I fell into a habit
of playing gin rummy in the evenings,

612
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,574
and did he cheat!

613
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,903
Oh, he was horrible.

614
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,156
Master, dinner is ready.

615
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,617
Oh, dear. Broken translator.

616
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:26,297
It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.

617
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,819
Thank you, master.

618
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:30,050
I liked his other voice.

619
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:34,551
Well, dinner is served. Right this way.

620
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:38,847
So, how are things stateside, huh?

621
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,349
Almost tempted to go back a few times,

622
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,015
but I have unfinished work here.

623
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,102
Please. I hope you're hungry,

624
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:52,485
because epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.

625
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:00,281
Oh, epsilon, you've done it again!

626
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,410
Yes!

627
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,952
Hey! Hey!

628
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,417
Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this.

629
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,965
You know, it's because of you
she had this dream

630
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,715
to come down here
and live by paradise falls.

631
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,342
I'm honored. And now you've made it.

632
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,890
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

633
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:23,016
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,
a real treat.

634
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,906
Treat! Where's the treat!
Dog 2° treat!

635
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,645
No, no. Quiet!
Calm down, calm down.

636
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,213
I want a treat! I want a treat!
Hey!

637
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,818
I shouldn't have used that word.

638
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:33,648
Having guests is a delight.

639
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:37,610
More often I get thieves
come to steal what's rightfully mine.

640
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,739
Nol

641
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,748
they called me a fraud, those...

642
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:50,251
But once I bring back this creature,
my name will be cleared.

643
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,132
Beautiful, isn't it?

644
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,468
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.

645
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,269
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.

646
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:09,817
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.

647
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,315
You can't go in after it.

648
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:15,030
Once in, there's no way out.

649
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,615
I've lost so many dogs.

650
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:24,782
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to take.

651
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,500
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

652
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,342
Hey, that looks like Kevin.

653
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:40,222
Kevin?
Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.

654
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,390
I trained it to follow us.

655
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,685
Follow you? It's impossible. How?

656
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,605
She likes chocolate. Chocolate?

657
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:52,610
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

658
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:55,608
But it ran off. It's gone now.

659
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:07,041
You know, Carl, these people
who pass through here,

660
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,709
they all tell pretty good stories.

661
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,665
A surveyor making a map.

662
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,797
A botanist cataloguing plants.

663
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:27,558
An old man taking his house
to paradise falls.

664
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:38,230
I mean, that's the best one yet.
I can't wait to hear how it ends.

665
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:51,494
Well, it's been a wonderful evening,
but we better be going.

666
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,919
Oh, you're not leaving.

667
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,624
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.

668
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,926
Come on, Russell.
But we haven't even had dessert yet.

669
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,925
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.

670
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:07,635
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.

671
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,938
Oh, you really must stay. I insist.

672
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,941
We have so much more to talk about.

673
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,442
Kevin?

674
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,531
It's here.

675
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:32,753
Get them!

676
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,919
Hurry!
I am hurrying!

677
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,295
Ahhh! They're coming

678
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,012
Master, over here.

679
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,822
Go toward the light, master!

680
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,053
Russell!

681
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,983
Get back!

682
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,532
Go on, master!
I will stop the dogs!

683
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,360
Stop, you dogs.

684
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,713
Whoa!

685
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,848
Help!

686
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,686
Help!

687
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,359
Help!

688
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,943
Caw, caw! Raar! Caw, caw! Raar!

689
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,899
Give me your hand!

690
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,962
Hang on to Kevin!

691
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,904
Kevin.

692
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,560
Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

693
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:46,854
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?

694
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,416
All right, but we gotta hurry.

695
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,542
You lost them?

696
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,796
No, it was dug.

697
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:13,221
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!

698
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,639
Wait.

699
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,559
Wait a minute. Dug.

700
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,268
See anything?

701
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,821
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy, they are dumb.

702
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,356
This is crazy.

703
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:35,035
I finally meet my childhood hero,
and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

704
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,486
Hey, I know a joke.

705
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,488
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,

706
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,788
I forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead.

707
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,211
Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.

708
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,542
Careful, Russell.

709
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,218
You okay, Kevin?

710
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,551
You know what, Mr. fredricksen?

711
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,513
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.

712
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,230
Yeah? How so?

713
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,808
It's kind of wild.

714
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,570
I mean, it's not how they made it sound
in my book.

715
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,568
Get used to that, kid.

716
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,071
My dad made it sound so easy.

717
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,243
He's really good at camping

718
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,413
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff

719
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,207
he used to come to all
my sweat lodge meetings.

720
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:27,166
And afterwards,
we'd go get ice cream at fentons.

721
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,416
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

722
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,502
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside,

723
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:37,389
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones,

724
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,055
and whoever gets the most wins.

725
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,559
I like that curb.

726
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,564
That might sound boring,

727
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:55,107
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff I remember the most.

728
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,456
Look! There it is!

729
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,624
Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still.

730
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,809
Look at that bird go.
Wait up, you overgrown chicken.

731
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,563
That's it. Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

732
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,944
Run, Kevin! Run!

733
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,115
Oh, no!

734
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,574
Russell, give me your knife!

735
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,578
Get away from my bird!

736
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,980
Nol

737
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:24,954
No!

738
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,164
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.

739
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,881
Let her go! Stop!

740
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,636
Ke vin!

741
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,152
You gave away Kevin.

742
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,829
You just gave her away.

743
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:13,253
This is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of this!

744
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,667
Master, it's alright.

745
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,377
I am not your master!

746
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,215
And if you hadn't have shown up,
none of this would've happened!

747
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,592
Bad dog! Bad dog!

748
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,027
Now, whether you assist me or not,

749
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:42,115
I am going to paradise falls
if it kills me.

750
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:58,107
Here. I don't want this anymore.

751
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:39,824
Russell?

752
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:45,872
Russell!

753
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:49,497
I'm gonna help Kevin, even if you won't!

754
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,834
No, Russell! No!

755
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,538
Huh?

756
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:06,744
Russell?

757
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:14,920
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

758
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:17,426
Can you stay?
Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

759
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:18,802
And I'm your master.

760
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,421
You're my master?

761
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,805
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

762
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,676
Good boy, dug!
You're a good boy!

763
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,619
Yes!

764
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,463
Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...

765
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:09,475
And they wouldn't believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.

766
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,763
Master?

767
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:14,309
The small mailman has returned.
What?

768
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,310
Let me go.

769
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,280
Where's your elderly friend? Y

770
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,201
he's not my friend anymore.

771
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:28,163
Well, if you're here,
fredricksen can't be far behind.

772
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,329
Where are you
keeping Kevin?

773
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:33,711
Let me go!

774
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,000
Scream all you want,
small mailman.

775
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,499
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.

776
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,670
I'll unleash
all my wilderness explorer training!

777
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,175
Alpha,
fredricksen's coming back.

778
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,896
Guard that bird. If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

779
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:55,357
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!

780
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,313
Nice talking with you.

781
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:01,568
Ahhh!

782
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,362
Where are you, fredricksen?

783
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,219
Russell!

784
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,393
Mr. fredricksen!
Dug, bring her over!

785
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:43,773
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go get her!

786
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,070
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.

787
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,409
But I wanna help.

788
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:48,739
I don't want your help.

789
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:50,579
I want you safe.

790
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:00,088
How do we get past these dogs?

791
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:01,798
Point!

792
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,431
Ke vin.

793
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:17,105
Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way.

794
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,727
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.

795
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,817
Guard well that bird, my minions.

796
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:26,152
What do we do now, dug?

797
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,296
Who wants the ball?

798
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,295
Me! I want it!
Me! I do!

799
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,114
I want the ball!
Give it to me!

800
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,423
Then go get it!

801
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,839
I'm gonna get there first!

802
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:51,340
Getting the ball

803
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,933
I got it!

804
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:54,312
Uh-oh.

805
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,108
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.

806
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,144
Master! He's gone!
The old man!

807
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,315
He's here!

808
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,481
He's got the bird!
The bird's gone...

809
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:08,608
Calm down! One at a time!

810
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,864
L... want... to... help!

811
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Ha-ha!

812
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,030
He's in hall d!
He's in hall c!

813
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,510
It's the old man!

814
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:31,972
Does anyone know where they are?

815
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,732
Gray leader? Take down the house.

816
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,785
Gray leader, checking in.

817
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:58,979
Gray two, checking in.

818
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:00,443
Gray three, checking in.

819
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,006
Target sighted.

820
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,012
Come on, Kevin.

821
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,354
Auuggghh!

822
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,853
Any last words, fredricksen? Come on!
Spit it out!

823
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,852
Come on.
Enough!

824
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:12,907
I am taking that bird back with me.
Alive or dead!

825
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,889
Come on, Kevin.

826
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:03,082
I will have many enjoyments
from what I am about to do, dug.

827
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,958
He wears the cone of shame!

828
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,925
What?
Do not just continue sitting. Attack!

829
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:23,306
No, no! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!

830
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,266
Listen, you dog. Sit!

831
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:28,099
Yes, Alpha.

832
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,809
Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is...

833
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,231
Ohl

834
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,572
I can't do it.

835
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,151
Russell! Huh?

836
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:42,742
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

837
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,158
You leave Mr. fredricksen alone!

838
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,760
Hey, squirrel!

839
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,846
Squirrel? Where?
Where? Where?

840
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,271
Where's the squirrel?

841
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:13,773
I hate squirrels.

842
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,259
Master!

843
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:41,638
Russell! Over here! Let's go!

844
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,311
Mr. fredricksen!

845
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,514
Go on, Kevin!

846
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:06,572
Nol

847
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,763
Russell! Get out of there!

848
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,885
No! Leave them alone!

849
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:47,367
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go of her!

850
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:51,541
Kevin! Chocolate!

851
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,682
That was cool!

852
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:22,107
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Easy, Russell.

853
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,902
Oh, I am ready to not be up high.

854
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,932
Sorry about your house,
Mr. fredricksen.

855
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,354
You know, it's just a house.

856
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,572
Look at you. You're so soft.

857
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,747
Awl!

858
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,620
I wish I could keep one.

859
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,043
Where's my cane? I just had it here.

860
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:32,642
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

861
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,058
Bye, Kevin!

862
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:45,776
Ready?

863
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,490
Ready.

864
01:26:58,255 --> 01:26:59,995
And by receiving
their badges,

865
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:04,754
the following explorers will graduate
to senior explorers.

866
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:08,971
For extreme mountaineering lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.

867
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:13,684
For wild animal defensive arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.

868
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:16,348
For assisting the elderly...

869
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,353
Uh, Russell, is there someone that...

870
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:26,196
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

871
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:30,525
I'm here for him.

872
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,987
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

873
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:39,251
Russell, for assisting the elderly

874
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:43,922
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

875
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:49,174
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

876
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:53,298
The Ellie badge.

877
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:57,393
Wow.

878
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,601
All right,
I think that covers everybody.

879
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,732
So let's give a big explorer call

880
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:10,524
to our brand new
senior wilderness explorers.

881
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:11,901
Ready, everybody?

882
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,531
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

883
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:22,293
Blue one.
Red one.

884
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,750
Blue one.
Gray one.

885
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,708
Red one.
That's a bike.

886
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,797
It's red, isn't it?

887
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,753
Mr. fredricksen,
you're cheating.

888
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,759
No, I'm not. Red one.

889
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,636
That's a fire hydrant.

890
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,807
Maybe I need new glasses.

891
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,763
Another blue one.

892
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:06,596
J' adventure is out there
it's heading our way

893
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:10,759
so grab your scarf and goggles
let's fly

894
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:15,435
I've mapped out our journey
we're up here to stay

895
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:19,768
a sunset is our home
a moonbeam we will own

896
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:23,647
my spirit of adventure is you

897
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:28,364
freaks of nature span a globe
that's too big to deny

898
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:32,788
with canine guards we'll travel there
and spit into their eye

899
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:37,502
bang, bang
once the smoke has cleared

900
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:41,502
after all the crowds have cheered

901
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:46,087
we'll make it a joint venture
before we're in our dentures

902
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:49,799
my spirit of adventure is you

903
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:12,158
J' adventure is out there
let's crack some champagne

904
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:16,491
I've hung a hundred heads
on my wall

905
01:35:16,586 --> 01:35:21,000
to say that I'm traveled
is far too mundane

906
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:25,379
let's grab our aero-fare
the high-brows will be there

907
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:29,713
the spirit of adventure
is something to indenture

908
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:34,176
my spirit of adventure is you j

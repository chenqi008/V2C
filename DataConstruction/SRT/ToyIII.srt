1
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:11,445
Money, money, money. Hey!

2
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:21,038
You got a date with justice,
one-eyed Bart.

3
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,041
Too bad, sheriff. I'm a married man.

4
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,211
One-eyed Betty!

5
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,345
Whoa! Whoa!

6
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,812
I think you dropped something, mister.

7
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,689
Jessie?
Give it up, Bart!

8
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:48,273
You've reached the end of the line!

9
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,484
I always wanted to go out with a bang!

10
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:01,912
Oh, no!
The orphans!

11
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:06,208
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.

12
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,172
Ooh!

13
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,633
It's me or the kiddies, sheriff.
Take your pick.

14
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,843
Whoo-hoo!

15
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,722
Ride like the wind, bullseye!
Hee-yah!

16
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,354
Hold him steady!

17
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,070
Woody, hurry!

18
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,311
Glad I could catch the train!

19
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:09,646
Now let's catch some criminals.

20
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,274
To infinity and beyond!

21
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,113
Whoo-hoo!

22
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,198
Ooh!

23
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,918
Reach for the sky.

24
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:32,335
You can't touch me, sheriff!

25
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,548
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

26
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,351
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

27
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,730
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

28
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,989
Huh?

29
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:08,455
Evil Dr. Pork chop!

30
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,543
That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork chop to you.

31
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,005
Buzz,
shoot your laser at my badge.

32
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,923
Woody, no-it'll kill you. Just do it!

33
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,556
You're going to jail, Bart.
Watch out!

34
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,854
No, no, no. Just keep
playing. Just pretend I'm not here.

35
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,022
Oh, no, Molly!

36
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,817
No, it's okay, mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.

37
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,612
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

38
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,864
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?

39
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,285
Come on.
Say happy birthday to Molly.

40
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,164
Happy birthday!
Oh, charming.

41
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,874
Happy birthday!

42
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,377
Look how tall you're getting.

43
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,836
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

44
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,096
I came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!

45
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:49,764
Got it, Woody.

46
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:52,600
Buzz ugh (year to; The rescue!

47
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,854
Good work, buzz.

48
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,737
Yee-haw!

49
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,799
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

50
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,093
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

51
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,762
All right, whose foot's in my face?
It's mine. Give it back.

52
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,844
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

53
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,976
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

54
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,019
Yes. No.

55
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:38,021
I mean, why would
I mind squeezing next to you?

56
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,232
Is it hot in here?

57
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,317
Oh! Here they come!

58
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,071
Sarge, you got it?

59
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,531
Mission accomplished.

60
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,782
Hooray!

61
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:52,035
Careful. Careful!

62
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,371
Ooh!
Oh!

63
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:57,540
All right, guys. We got one shot at this.
Everyone ready?

64
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,418
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

65
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,670
Okay, buzz. Make the call.

66
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,851
Target is on approach.

67
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,229
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.

68
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:39,374
Hello? Anyone there?

69
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,211
Molly, stay out of my room!

70
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,379
I wasn't in your room.

71
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,423
Then who was messing
with my stuff?

72
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,883
It wasn't me.

73
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,558
Well, that went well.

74
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,603
He held me! He actually held me!

75
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:01,646
Oh, this is just sad.

76
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,149
Who we kiddin'?
The kid's 17 years old.

77
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,068
We ain't ever
gettin' played with.

78
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,490
Guys, hey, hold up.

79
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,242
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

80
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,493
Not again!

81
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,079
Oh, come on. Slink,
gather everyone up.

82
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,915
Uh, we are gathered, Woody.

83
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,667
Okay. First off,

84
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,796
we all knew operation playtime
was a long shot.

85
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,339
More like a misfire.

86
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:32,386
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about...

87
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,596
Being there for Andy. We know.

88
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:36,181
But we can try again! Right?

89
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,602
I'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

90
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,895
What?

91
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:44,230
Andy's going to college any day now.

92
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,233
That was our last shot.
Oh.

93
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,818
We're going
into attic mode, folks.

94
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,777
Keep your accessories
with you at all times.

95
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,864
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

96
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:56,493
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

97
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,288
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

98
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,457
Yeah, but now it's here.

99
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,875
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...

100
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,293
Hey, sarge! What are you doing?

101
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,006
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.

102
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,133
Moving on?
You're going awol?

103
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:14,010
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.

104
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:16,346
And let's face it,
when the trash bags come out,

105
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,098
we army guys are the first to go.

106
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,725
Trash bags?
Who said anything about trash bags?

107
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,938
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.

108
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:28,066
You're gonna need it.

109
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,901
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

110
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:32,505
We're getting thrown away?
No. No one's getting thrown away.

111
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,739
How do you know?

112
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:35,865
We're being abandoned!
We'll be fine, Jessie.

113
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:38,326
So why did sarge leave?
Should we leave?

114
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,663
I thought we were goin' to the attic.
Oh, I hate all this uncertainty!

115
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,767
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

116
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,669
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.

117
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:51,005
I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way.

118
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,676
Wheezy and etch and...
Bo peep?

119
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:59,097
Yeah. Even Bo.

120
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,434
All good toys
who've gone on to new owners.

121
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,188
But through every yard sale, every
spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

122
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,691
He must care about us,
or we wouldn't be here.

123
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:14,529
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm...

124
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,032
And we'll all be together.
Exactly!

125
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,950
There's games up there,
and books, and...

126
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:22,037
The racecar track!
The racecar track. Thank you!

127
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,499
And the old TV.
There you go, the old TV.

128
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,711
And those guys from the Christmas
decorations box. They're fun, right?

129
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,213
Yeah.

130
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:34,966
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.

131
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,594
And he'll play with us then, right?

132
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,388
We'll always be there for him.

133
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:42,724
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready,

134
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,268
and go out on a high note.

135
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,103
I'd better find my other eye.

136
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:49,189
Where'd you leave it this time?

137
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,359
Someplace dark. And dusty.

138
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,821
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on ebay.

139
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:59,532
Don't worry. Andy's gonna
take care of us. I guarantee it!

140
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,601
You guarantee it, huh?

141
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,729
I don't know, buzz.
What else could I say?

142
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,483
Well, whatever happens,
at least we'll all be together.

143
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,862
For infinity and beyond.

144
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,614
Can I have your stereo?
No.

145
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:41,296
Why not?
'Cause I'm taking it with me.

146
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,207
Can I have your computer?
No.

147
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,584
Your video games?
Forget it, Molly.

148
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,420
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

149
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,090
Anything you're not taking to college
either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

150
00:11:57,132 --> 00:12:00,176
Mom, I'm not leaving till Friday.
Come on. It's garbage day.

151
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,053
Mom.
Look, it's simple.

152
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:06,474
Skateboard, college.
Little league trophy, probably attic.

153
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:09,018
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

154
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,479
Why do you still have these toys?

155
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,607
Molly, out of my room!

156
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,317
Three more days and it's mine!

157
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,860
Molly, you're not off the hook either.

158
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,865
You have more toys
than you know what to do with.

159
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,077
Some of them could make
other kids really happy.

160
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,282
What kids?

161
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,453
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.

162
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,579
What's daycare?

163
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,914
Mom.
No buts.

164
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:32,208
You choose the toys you want to
donate, i'ii drop them off at sunnyside.

165
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,180
Poor Barbie.

166
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,514
I get the corvette.

167
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,058
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.

168
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:50,143
Like what?

169
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,145
Like what are you gonna do
with these toys?

170
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,189
Should we donate them to sunnyside?
No.

171
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,440
Maybe sell them online?

172
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,484
Mom, no one's gonna want
those old toys.

173
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,444
They're junk.

174
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,238
Fine. You have till Friday.

175
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:04,032
Anything that's not packed for college
or in the attic

176
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,118
is getting thrown out.
Whatever you say, mom.

177
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,691
What's happening?
We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

178
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,716
That's what's happening.

179
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:19,065
You need a hand?
I got it.

180
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:20,108
Here.

181
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,360
So, you gonna miss me
when I'm gone?

182
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,821
If I say no, do I still get your room?
Nope

183
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:26,739
then, yes, I'll miss you.

184
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:28,616
I can't breathe!

185
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:30,993
Oh, this can't be happening!
Quiet! What's that sound?

186
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,007
Andy!

187
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:48,261
That's not trash.
That's not trash!

188
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:50,305
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think. Oh!

189
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,892
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

190
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,109
Okay, boy. To the curb! Hee-yah!

191
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,321
No, buster! No!

192
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:12,160
Get up. Buster!

193
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,219
We're on the curb!
Oh, I knew it would come to this!

194
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,804
Pull, everyone! Pull!

195
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,233
It won't rip!
Oh, forget it!

196
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,944
It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene!

197
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:48,195
There's gotta be a way out!

198
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,918
Oh, Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

199
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,532
Point. Point. Point!

200
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,621
Push! Push!

201
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,206
I can hear the garbage truck!

202
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,042
It's getting closer.

203
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:39,914
Buzz! Jessie!

204
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,175
Andy threw us out.
Like we were garbage.

205
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,970
Junk. He called us junk.
How could he?

206
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,931
This doesn't make any sense.

207
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,560
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.

208
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,062
Sarge was right.
Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

209
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:05,731
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

210
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,484
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

211
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,277
Should we be hysterical?
No!

212
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,321
Yes!
Maybe! But not right now!

213
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:15,904
Yee-haw! Fellas, I know what to do.

214
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,291
What the heck?

215
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,045
Oh, we should've done this years ago.
Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

216
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:31,132
He's fine, buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.

217
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:32,800
Now we need to go!

218
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,720
You're right. Come on.

219
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,097
Buzz?
Woody!

220
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:41,267
What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

221
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,311
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.

222
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,645
We're going to daycare!

223
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,357
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?

224
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:49,984
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.

225
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,737
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.

226
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,656
Attic? So how did we
end up on the curb?

227
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:57,408
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.

228
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,869
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

229
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,329
And called us junk!

230
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:04,582
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.

231
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,459
Sure thing, college boy!

232
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:10,795
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.

233
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,842
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

234
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,904
Come on, buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.

235
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:20,181
Woody, wait. We need to figure out
what's best for everyone.

236
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,189
Oh, great. Great! It's gonna take us
forever to get back here.

237
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,326
Oh, it's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

238
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:44,868
Well, Molly and I have been
growing apart for years.

239
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:49,376
It's just... I can't believe
she would throw me away!

240
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,754
Welcome to the club, toots.

241
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:55,132
Okay, everyone, listen up. We can get
back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.

242
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:56,986
We'll hide under the seats
till we get back home.

243
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,594
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.

244
00:18:58,678 --> 00:18:59,887
Andy doesn't want us anymore.

245
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,265
He was putting you in the attic!

246
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,392
He left us on the curb!

247
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,228
All right, calm down! Both of you!
Okay, fine. Fine.

248
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,950
Just wait till you see
what daycare's like.

249
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,608
Why? What's it like?
Daycare is a sad, lonely place

250
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,861
for washed-up old toys
who have no owners.

251
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,676
Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
Oh, you'll see.

252
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,911
As soon as we get to daycare,
you'll be begging to go home.

253
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:40,511
Can anyone see anything?

254
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:41,846
There's a playground!

255
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,972
V'.

256
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,058
We hit the jackpot, bullseye!

257
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,185
So much for sad and lonely, huh?

258
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,580
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.

259
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:51,480
Perspective? This place is perfect.

260
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:55,609
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

261
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:01,198
Hey there!
Wow!

262
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:02,783
Haven't seen you in ages.

263
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,327
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

264
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,998
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

265
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,292
Say hi, sweetie.
Hi.

266
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,586
Hey, how are
your kids? Molly and Andy?

267
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:16,922
Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.

268
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,591
What?
Can you believe it?

269
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:22,219
You sure they won't miss these?
No, they never get played with.

270
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:26,765
You see any kids?
Where is she taking us?

271
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:35,524
Look!
Wow!

272
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,234
What? What is it?

273
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:43,991
No, no, no.

274
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,160
What's the matter with you?

275
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,997
I can't see!

276
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,833
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

277
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,334
Yay!

278
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,340
So now what do we do?
We go back to Andy's.

279
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:00,383
Anyone see an exit?

280
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,177
Exit, shmexit.
Let's get played with.

281
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,762
Careful. These toys might be
jealous of new arrivals.

282
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,014
I want to see!
Hey!

283
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,264
Rex!
It's my turn!

284
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:14,355
New toys!

285
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,571
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.

286
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,491
Buzz lightyear at your service.

287
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:26,867
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

288
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:32,248
Oh. Thank you. May I?

289
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,500
Ooh!

290
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,753
The claw!

291
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:48,722
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.

292
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:53,227
Welcome to sunnyside, folks.
I'm lots-o'-huggin' bear.

293
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,855
But please call me lotso.

294
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,815
Buzz lightyear. We come in...

295
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:01,902
First thing you gotta know about me,
I'm a hugger.

296
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:05,865
Oh, look at you all. You've been
through a lot today, haven't ya?

297
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,617
Oh, it's been horrible.

298
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,703
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.

299
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:14,290
We been dumped, donated,
yard-saled, secondhanded

300
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,668
and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait,

301
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:21,338
you'll find being donated was the
best thing that ever happened to ya.

302
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,801
Mr. Lotso, do toys here
get played with every day?

303
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:28,470
All day long. Five days a week.

304
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,473
But what happens
when the kids grow up?

305
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,350
Well, now, I'll tell ya.

306
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:35,686
When the kids get old,
new ones come in.

307
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,230
When they get old,
new ones replace them.

308
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:43,277
You'll never be outgrown or neglected,
never abandoned or forgotten.

309
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,781
No owners means no heartbreak.

310
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,282
Yee-haw!

311
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,786
It's a miracle.
And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

312
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,329
Because we're Andy's toys!

313
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,416
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

314
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:59,418
Well, it's his loss, sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.

315
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,897
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
Now, let's get you all settled in.

316
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:05,966
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!

317
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,469
Far out! Down in a jiff, lotso.

318
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,768
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

319
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,395
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.

320
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,199
Folks, if you want to step
right this way...

321
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,367
Hi, I'm Ken.

322
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,120
Barbie. Have we ever met?

323
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,288
Uh-uh.

324
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,290
I would've remembered.

325
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,084
Love your legwarmers.
Nice ascot-.

326
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,170
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.

327
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:45,214
Right on, lotso. This way, everybody.

328
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:50,841
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

329
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,599
What a nice bear.
And he smells like strawberries.

330
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,853
Folks, if I can share,
here at sunnyside, we've got,

331
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,813
well, just about anything
a toy could ask for.

332
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:02,690
Spare parts, superglue,

333
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,193
and enough fresh batteries
to choke a hungry hungry hippo.

334
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,529
Think you're gettin' old?
Wow.

335
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,155
Well, stop your worryin'.

336
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,993
Our repair spa will keep you
stuffed, puffed, and lightly buffed.

337
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,661
Ne“ 1

338
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:18,205
and this, well, this is where I live.

339
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:21,041
It's Ken's dream house.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.

340
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:24,044
And a whole room
just for trying on clothes.

341
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,381
You have everything!

342
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,300
Everything except
someone to share it with.

343
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:36,640
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me. Here we are.

344
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,687
Well, thank you, big baby.

345
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,857
Why don't you come meet
our new friends?

346
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:48,777
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together, me and him.

347
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:51,071
Abandoned by the same owner.

348
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:54,032
But we don't need owners
at sunnyside.

349
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,411
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

350
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:58,954
We control our own destiny.

351
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,582
Watch out for puddles.

352
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,253
And here's where
you folks'll be stayin'.

353
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,254
The caterpillar room.

354
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:10,549
Look at this place.
Wow!

355
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:12,634
Holy moly guacamole.

356
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,220
Jackpot, baby.

357
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:16,096
Whoa, puppy!
Hello.

358
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,222
Hello.
Hello.

359
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:21,101
It's so beautiful!

360
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,440
What the... oh. Hey, little guy.

361
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:28,901
How long's it been
since you all got played with?

362
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:29,985
It's been years.

363
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:34,282
Well, just you wait.
In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring,

364
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:37,201
and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreamin' of.

365
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,121
Play! Real play! I can't wait!

366
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:43,123
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be headin' back.

367
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,209
Welcome to sunnyside, folks.

368
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,395
Thank you.
Take care, pinky.

369
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,022
Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you.
Thank you, buddy boy.

370
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,215
Will I see you again?
Oh, I'll see you tonight

371
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,800
in my dreams.

372
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,219
Ken, let's get a move on.

373
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,721
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

374
00:25:57,805 --> 00:26:01,558
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Heck, you don't know me from g.I. Joe,

375
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:03,727
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...

376
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:05,651
Made for each other.
Made for each other.

377
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:08,815
Nay!
Y es.

378
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,818
Coming, lotso.

379
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,822
This is so exciting!

380
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,663
Sounds like kids to me.

381
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,208
Oh, I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?

382
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,835
How many you reckon are out there?

383
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,670
They sound so sweet.

384
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:39,346
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

385
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:41,932
But we need to go home.

386
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:44,226
We can have
a whole new life here, Woody.

387
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:47,312
A chance to make kids happy again.

388
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,149
Why don't you stay?
Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

389
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,502
Come on, woodster!
You'll get played with.

390
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,610
I can't. No.
Stay here.

391
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:55,013
You can make a new kid happy.
No, no. Guys, really. No!

392
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:59,074
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

393
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,161
And if he wants us at college,
or in the attic,

394
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,914
well, then, our job is
to be there for him.

395
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:07,499
Now, I'm going home.

396
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,670
Anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. Come on, buzz.

397
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:16,800
Buzz?

398
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,805
Our mission with Andy
is complete, Woody.

399
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,726
And what's important now
is we stay together.

400
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:28,937
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

401
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:31,481
Look under your boot, buzz.
You, too, Jessie.

402
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,775
Whose name is written there?

403
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:37,071
Maybe Andy doesn't
care about us anymore.

404
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,907
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!

405
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,701
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

406
00:27:41,742 --> 00:27:43,660
You can't just turn your back
on him now!

407
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,873
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!

408
00:27:50,793 --> 00:27:52,753
Okay, fine. Perfect.

409
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:56,381
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

410
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,600
So this is it?
After all we've been through.

411
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,911
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

412
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:31,166
Bullseye. No, I said, stay!

413
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:34,419
Look,

414
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:39,299
I don't want you left alone
in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

415
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:48,892
I gotta go.

416
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,064
Bonnie, you in here?

417
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,379
Come on. Come on.
Oh, no, no.

418
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,713
What... what the heck?

419
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,550
Now, that's better.

420
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,261
Bonnie!
Bluebells, cockleshells...

421
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:09,348
There you are.
Come on, honey. It's time to go home.

422
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,332
Oh! No, no, no, no!

423
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:18,959
Reach for the sky!

424
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,380
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...

425
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:32,305
You 're my favorite deputy.

426
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,641
Bonnie!
Coming!

427
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:39,604
Great.

428
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,783
Impenng

429
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,744
oh, it's gonna be okay, bullseye.

430
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,580
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.

431
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,249
Ah, he's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.

432
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,001
Toys are for playtime.

433
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:04,087
Oh, speaking of playtime,
they're lining up out there!

434
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:06,131
How many?
There must be dozens.

435
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:07,424
I can hardly wait!

436
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,926
Places, everyone!

437
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,776
At last! I'm gonna get played with!

438
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:28,486
Uh, Rex?
Come to papa.

439
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,301
I'ineking

440
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,918
There 's a snake in my boat.

441
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:30,298
I 'd like to join your posse, boys,
but first I 'm gonna sing a little song.

442
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:31,383
A sheriff!

443
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,928
Move over, Mr. Pricklepants.

444
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,723
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?

445
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:43,391
It's good for you. But don't drink
too much, or you'll have to... have to...

446
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,897
Be right back!

447
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,775
Psst! Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.

448
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,612
Can you tell me where I am?

449
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:53,113
The guy's just asking a question.

450
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,366
Well, excuse me.
I'm trying to stay in character.

451
00:33:57,826 --> 00:34:00,870
My name's buttercup.
You've met baron Von shush.

452
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,164
Hello, I'm Trixie.

453
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,793
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.

454
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:09,129
We're either in a café in Paris
or a coffee shop in New Jersey.

455
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:11,233
I'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor

456
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,133
with life-changing news.

457
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,978
We do a lot of improv here. Just stay
loose, have fun, you'll be fine.

458
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,848
No, no, no, no. I...
Who wants lunch?

459
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,516
Bee-boop-bee-boop.

460
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,396
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.

461
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,607
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

462
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,193
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?

463
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:40,948
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!

464
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,330
I know where to hide.

465
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,335
She'll never find us in here.

466
00:34:50,212 --> 00:34:51,671
What's wrong?

467
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:56,509
She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

468
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,346
You're doing great!
Are you classically-trained?

469
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,157
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here!

470
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:02,557
There is no way out.

471
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,203
Just kidding. Door's right over there.

472
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:08,313
Well, cowboy, you just
jumped right in, didn't ya? I'm Dolly.

473
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:09,689
Uh, Woody.
Woody?

474
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:11,482
Really? You're gonna stick with that?

475
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:14,194
'Cause now's your chance to change it,
new room and all.

476
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,904
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.

477
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,533
Who's the new guy?
Are you a real cowboy?

478
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:21,826
Well, actually...
'Course he's not, pea brain.

479
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,122
He don't even have a hat.
I do too have... my hat!

480
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:27,415
Told ya.
I found a spaceship!

481
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:28,833
Showtime.

482
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,378
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.

483
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,048
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.

484
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,385
Three, two, one, blastoff!

485
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:42,889
Yee-haw!

486
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:46,392
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.

487
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:57,654
Oh, I got a kink in my slink.

488
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,660
My tail! Where's my tail?

489
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,417
Someone need a hand?

490
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,919
Where's my nose?
Here it is.

491
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:14,272
Here's your arm.
Give me that. That's mine.

492
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:15,422
Honey, the mustache?

493
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,300
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

494
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:21,719
Andy never played with us like that.

495
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,722
We're just gonna have to
make the best of it.

496
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,575
But these toddlers,
they don't know how to play with us.

497
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,934
They're too young!
Yeah, they're sticky.

498
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,371
Well, we should be
in the butterfly room.

499
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,437
With the big kids!

500
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,521
That's right.

501
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:33,416
Yeah, you said it.
We'ii get this straightened out.

502
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,067
I'll go talk to lotso
about moving us to the other room.

503
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,532
Blast. Try that one.

504
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,783
It's locked!

505
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,869
Same here.
Try the windows.

506
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,871
Negatory.
It's a fenster-schneckler 380.

507
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,666
Finest childproof lock in the world.

508
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:52,792
We're trapped!
Wait.

509
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:54,210
Did anyone notice the transom?

510
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:57,797
Oh, great. How do we get up there?

511
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,303
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...

512
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,179
Three!
Whoa!

513
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:08,474
Let go!

514
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:28,119
He did it!
Yes, sir!

515
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,622
Way to go, buzz!

516
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,668
Yeah,
you think they had a fun playtime?

517
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,087
They might hear you.

518
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,800
Okay, now you start.
I...

519
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,093
Love...
You.

520
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,512
See? That time, I said love.
Okay, now me first.

521
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,638
Okay, okay, okay.
I...

522
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,847
Love...
You.

523
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,975
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.

524
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,727
You are so smart.

525
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,436
Come on, Romeo. We're late.

526
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:55,814
I'll wait up for you.
Kisses!

527
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,231
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.

528
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,482
Come on. Any splits?
Heya. Bring it here.

529
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,548
All right.
Here we go.

530
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,591
Come on, horsey, come on!

531
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,735
Come on, Turkey,
come on, Turkey.

532
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:07,362
Gobble, gobble, baby.
Come on, horsey.

533
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,387
Come on, duck.

534
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:10,406
All right, that's it. No more bets.
Come on! Right here.

535
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,533
Let me have the duck, let
me have the duck,

536
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,599
let me have the duck!

537
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,226
Here is a duck.

538
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,852
I won!
Ah, man!

539
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,648
Well, stretch takes the round.
You lost!

540
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,357
Okay, minimum bet, five monopoly.

541
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:22,942
Coyote's wild.
Here, here.

542
00:39:23,026 --> 00:39:24,587
Two Greens here.
Changing two double a's.

543
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:26,798
Hey, what do you guys think
of the new recruits? Any keepers?

544
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,615
Oh, please! Landfill!

545
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,243
Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
Toddler fodder.

546
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,121
But that space guy, he could be useful.

547
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:38,124
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

548
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,375
Neither are you, chunk.

549
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,963
You got a little keeper yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

550
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,507
Hey, lay off, twitch. Barbie's different.

551
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,509
Aw, Mr. Softy over here.

552
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,636
What do you expect from a girl's toy?

553
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,640
I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?

554
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,558
Ah, all them toys are disposable.

555
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,603
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

556
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:06,486
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

557
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:08,905
Let me go!

558
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:10,656
Take him to the “haw.

559
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,741
7' I

560
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,190
1225 sycamore.

561
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,693
Psst. Woody, what are you doing?

562
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:48,736
I gotta get outta here.

563
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,781
You're leaving?
But didn't you have fun today?

564
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:53,676
Well, of course I did,
more than I've had in years,

565
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,868
but, you see, I belong to someone else.

566
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,164
Who's yid-nuh?
I believe it's pronounced yid-nay.

567
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,124
Guys, it says Andy.

568
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,459
He's my Bonnie.

569
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:04,669
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.

570
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:07,422
Where's home?
Elm street. 234 elm.

571
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,800
You guys have a map?
We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?

572
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:13,261
I'ii fire up the computer.

573
00:41:18,558 --> 00:41:21,686
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to lotso!

574
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,563
Zip it, buck Rogers.

575
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:26,274
You don't talk to lotso
till we say you can...

576
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:32,155
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

577
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:33,990
He got out, lotso.

578
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:39,074
Got out? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.

579
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:45,084
F-a-oh, my schwarz.
There you go. I'm so sorry.

580
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,754
Lotso, there's been a mistake.
A mistake?

581
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,066
The children in the caterpillar room
are not age-appropriate

582
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,382
for me and my friends.

583
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,428
We respectfully request
a transfer to the butterfly room.

584
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:56,304
Well, request granted!

585
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,807
But, lotso...
Hush now, Kenneth.

586
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,226
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.

587
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,437
Why, I'd say
we've found ourselves a keeper.

588
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:07,440
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

589
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,405
We're calling you up
to the big leagues, son.

590
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,283
From now on,
you'll have anything you want.

591
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,451
Excellent. I'll go get my friends.

592
00:42:18,493 --> 00:42:21,120
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

593
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,582
Those caterpillar kids
need someone to play with.

594
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:25,583
But my friends don't belong there.

595
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,710
Oh, none of us do, I agree.

596
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:31,214
Which is why,
for the good of our community,

597
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,800
we ask the newer toys,
the stronger ones,

598
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:37,554
to take on the hardships
the rest of us can't bear anymore.

599
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:41,057
Well, I guess that makes sense.

600
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,896
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

601
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:48,773
Family man, huh? I understand.

602
00:42:49,524 --> 00:42:51,067
Put him back in the timeout chair.

603
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,529
What are ya... unhand me!

604
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,657
Bring in the bookworm.

605
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,121
Ah! Here it is.

606
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:06,332
It was filed under lightyear.

607
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,672
Let's see here.

608
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,925
Accessories. Maintenance.
Oh. Here we go.

609
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,763
Remove screws to access
battery compartment.

610
00:43:19,846 --> 00:43:21,013
What are you doing?

611
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:22,682
Stop!

612
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:24,308
Let go of me! Ow!

613
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:28,851
To return your buzz lightyear action
figure to its original factory settings...

614
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,818
slide the switch from play to demo.

615
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,572
Stop! No! No! No!

616
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:41,158
What was that?
Sounds like it came from the hall.

617
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,827
I'll see what it was.

618
00:43:45,705 --> 00:43:47,164
What do you see? Anything?

619
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,752
No, just a dark
hallway and... wait. Wait!

620
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:52,503
I see Andy!

621
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,381
What?
That's impossible.

622
00:43:54,422 --> 00:43:56,882
No, no, I really see him. In his room.

623
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,720
My other eye!
The one I left behind.

624
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,060
This is so weird. He 's packing up.

625
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:11,852
Uh-oh. Oh, here comes buster.
Out of the way! Get away!

626
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,485
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.

627
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,655
He's looking in the attic.

628
00:44:18,738 --> 00:44:22,074
Wait, there's mom.
Why is he so upset?

629
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,912
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

630
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,500
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!

631
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,085
He's looking for us?

632
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,046
50 Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!

633
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:37,423
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

634
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,316
Well, then, Woody was telling the truth.

635
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,553
Holy cow!
And you didn't believe him.

636
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,138
Hey, you didn't believe him first!

637
00:44:43,221 --> 00:44:46,140
Guys, we gotta... we gotta go home!

638
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,811
Lotso!
Hey, there.

639
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:52,480
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?

640
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,899
Thank goodness!
Have you seen buzz?

641
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:57,318
There's been a mistake. We have to go.

642
00:44:57,402 --> 00:45:01,902
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the Nick of time, too.

643
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,951
We were runnin' low on volunteers
for the little ones.

644
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,787
They just love new toys,
now, don't they?

645
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:10,831
Love? We've been chewed,
kicked, drooled on.

646
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,876
Just look at my pocketbook!

647
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,043
Hmm.

648
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:18,297
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' sunnyside.

649
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,801
Sweet potato!
Who do you think you're talking to?

650
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:26,552
I have over 30 accessories,
and I deserve more respect...

651
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:29,266
Ah... that's better.

652
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,894
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,
except me.

653
00:45:31,978 --> 00:45:34,021
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

654
00:45:34,105 --> 00:45:35,815
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.

655
00:45:35,857 --> 00:45:36,899
Whoa there, missy.

656
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,985
You're not goin' anywhere.

657
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,863
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?

658
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:45,491
Buzz! You're back!

659
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:47,034
Moo-yaw.
Buzz?

660
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,120
Hey!

661
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:51,497
Look out!

662
00:45:51,831 --> 00:45:52,998
What are you, nuts?

663
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,250
V

664
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,340
Prisoners disabled,
commander lotso!

665
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,634
Buzz, what are you doing?
Silence, minions of zurg!

666
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,803
You're in the custody
of the galactic alliance!

667
00:46:04,844 --> 00:46:06,345
Zurg?
Galactic alliance?

668
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,430
Oh, boy.

669
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,266
Good work, lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!

670
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,351
Yes, sir!

671
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,895
I'ine

672
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:19,650
ow!

673
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,612
Where do you think you're going?

674
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,658
Buzz! We're your friends!

675
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,702
Spare me your lies, temptress.

676
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:30,202
Your emperor's defeated,

677
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,415
and I'm immune to
your bewitching good looks.

678
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:36,167
Hey, mongol
keep your paws off my wife!

679
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,960
Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!

680
00:46:38,044 --> 00:46:39,045
Not him.

681
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,673
I think this potato needs to
learn himself some manners.

682
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,509
Take him to the box.

683
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,303
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?

684
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,805
Bad baby! Bad baby!

685
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:50,431
Ken? What's going on?

686
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:53,851
Barbie! I told you to wait
in the dream house.

687
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:55,213
What are you doing to my friends?

688
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,063
Get in there!

689
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,441
Barbie, wait!
Don't touch me.

690
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:03,027
We're through!
Barbie! I did...

691
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,407
And give me my scarf back!
Ow!

692
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,577
Lightyear! Explain our
overnight accommodations.

693
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,872
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.

694
00:47:14,914 --> 00:47:18,626
Any prisoner caught outside their cell
spends the night in the box.

695
00:47:19,085 --> 00:47:20,878
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

696
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:25,091
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

697
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,219
Prisoners do not speak
unless spoken to.

698
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:30,596
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night...

699
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:32,097
In the box! We get it.

700
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,311
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.

701
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:39,897
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

702
00:47:39,939 --> 00:47:41,273
Don't worry, commander.

703
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,527
Any doubt I had
got pounded out of me at the academy.

704
00:47:45,236 --> 00:47:46,779
Listen up, folks.

705
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:49,365
We got a way of doin' things
here at sunnyside.

706
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:52,493
If you start at the bottom,
pay your dues,

707
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,870
life here can be a dream come true!

708
00:47:55,663 --> 00:47:58,749
But if you break our rules,
step outta line,

709
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:04,042
try to check out early,
well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.

710
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:08,801
Woody! What did you do to him?

711
00:48:09,302 --> 00:48:11,637
You all get a good night's rest.

712
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:14,932
You got a full day
of playtime tomorrow.

713
00:48:21,022 --> 00:48:24,400
1225 syca...

714
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,904
Who's velocistar237?

715
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:30,614
Oh! That's just a dinosaur toy
down the street.

716
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,076
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.

717
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:34,952
Just a dinosaur.
All right.

718
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,164
Sycamore. Okay, enter!

719
00:48:38,998 --> 00:48:41,041
Please don't be far. Please, please!

720
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:45,504
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!

721
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,881
Yay!

722
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:51,344
I'm going to college! Look at me!
I'm big toy on campus! Hello!

723
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,097
Hey, I'll see you at the sock hop.
Okay, potsie.

724
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:57,808
Hey, listen. If any of you guys
ever get to sunnyside daycare,

725
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,994
you tell 'em Woody made it home.

726
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:02,229
You came from sunnyside?
But how'd you escape?

727
00:49:02,313 --> 00:49:04,148
Well, it wasn't easy.

728
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,359
What do you mean escape?

729
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,072
Sunnyside is a place
of ruin and despair.

730
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,701
Ruled by an evil bear
who smells of strawberries.

731
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,036
Lotso?

732
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,789
The guy may seem plush
and huggable on the outside,

733
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,583
but inside, he's a monster.

734
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,043
But... how do you know that?

735
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,046
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

736
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:34,803
Yeah, I knew lotso.

737
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:38,933
He was a good toy. A friend.

738
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:43,437
Me and him,
we had the same kid, Daisy.

739
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,900
I was there
when lotso got unwrapped.

740
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,071
Daisy loved us all.

741
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,739
But lotso,

742
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,992
lotso was special.

743
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,662
They did everything together.

744
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,791
You've never seen
a kid and a toy more in love.

745
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,628
One day, we took a drive.

746
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:10,923
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

747
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,010
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

748
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,896
She never came back.

749
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,278
Lotso wouldn't give up.

750
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:39,201
It took forever,
but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

751
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,836
But by then, it was too late.

752
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:03,142
Something changed that day
inside lotso.

753
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:05,477
Something snapped.

754
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,772
She replaced us. Come on!

755
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:11,067
No, she only replaced you!
She replaced all of us.

756
00:51:11,734 --> 00:51:12,776
Didn't she?

757
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,657
She don't love you no more!

758
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,159
Now come on!

759
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:29,331
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.

760
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,385
Then we found sunnyside.

761
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:50,564
But lotso wasn't my friend anymore.

762
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,318
He wasn't anyone's friend.

763
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,116
He took over sunnyside
and rigged the whole system.

764
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,660
So how'd you get out?

765
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,414
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.

766
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:09,208
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

767
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,379
It ain't right what lotso done.
New toys,

768
00:52:14,213 --> 00:52:16,173
they don't stand a chance.

769
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,717
But my friends are in there.
You can't go back.

770
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:21,220
Returning now would be suicide!

771
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:23,055
But what about your Andy?

772
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:26,058
Isn't he leaving for college?

773
00:52:44,702 --> 00:52:46,995
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

774
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,040
Impenng

775
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,127
oh, bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

776
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,590
But he ain't ever comin' back.

777
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,822
Rise and shine, campers!

778
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,490
Commander lotso, sir!

779
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,868
All quiet, nothing to report.

780
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,497
Excellent, lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at star command.

781
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,957
Wait! What've you done
with my husband?

782
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,543
Big baby.

783
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:40,465
Sweetheart!

784
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:46,055
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of Lincoln logs.

785
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:48,474
Uh, I don't think
those were Lincoln logs.

786
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:52,311
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!

787
00:55:14,268 --> 00:55:15,727
Uh, hello?

788
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,521
You shouldn't
have come back, cowboy.

789
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:21,942
They've cracked down hard since
you left. More guards, more patrols.

790
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:24,213
You and your friends
ain't ever getting out of here now.

791
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,529
I made it out once.

792
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:28,448
You got lucky once. Want my advice?

793
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,952
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

794
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:32,661
Yeah, for how long?

795
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:33,912
I 've been here years.

796
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,415
They'll never break me.

797
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:39,251
There's only one way
toys leave this place.

798
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,880
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

799
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,215
Then it's off to the dump.

800
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,010
Look, I appreciate
your concern, old-timer.

801
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:51,222
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.

802
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,517
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I'd sure be grateful.

803
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,771
Well, if you're gonna get out,

804
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,695
first thing you gotta get through 's
the doors.

805
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:05,569
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.

806
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:06,653
Got it. What else?

807
00:56:06,737 --> 00:56:08,947
Lotso has
trucks patrolling all night long.

808
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:11,366
Hallway, lobby, playground.

809
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:12,594
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?

810
00:56:12,618 --> 00:56:14,119
Eight-feet high.

811
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:15,954
Cinder block. No way through it.

812
00:56:16,038 --> 00:56:17,289
You go over or under.

813
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,541
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

814
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:22,294
It's not.
Your real problem 's the monkey.

815
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,215
The monkey's the eye in the sky.

816
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,883
He sees everything.

817
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,136
Classrooms.

818
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,314
Hallways.

819
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,908
Even the playground.

820
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:04,586
You can unlock doors,
sneak past guards, climb the wall,

821
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,299
but if you Don 't take out that monkey,
you ain't going nowhere.

822
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:12,094
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!

823
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,306
Recess! Come on, kids!

824
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:21,562
Psst! Psst!

825
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,772
Hey, guys.

826
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,232
Woody?
Woody!

827
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:26,692
Woody!

828
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,277
Hey, hey, hey, buddy!

829
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,570
Thank goodness!

830
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,906
You're alive!
'Course I'm alive!

831
00:57:33,157 --> 00:57:35,993
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's buzz?

832
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,703
Lotso did something to him!

833
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,955
He thinks he's a real
space ranger again.

834
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,457
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

835
00:57:41,832 --> 00:57:43,416
Return of the astro-nut.

836
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:48,251
Oh, Woody, we were wrong
to leave Andy. I was wrong.

837
00:57:48,589 --> 00:57:51,008
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

838
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,344
No, no, it's my fault
for leaving you guys.

839
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,680
From now on, we stick together.

840
00:57:56,722 --> 00:57:58,515
But Andy's leavin' for college.

841
00:57:58,557 --> 00:58:00,433
College? Hog-tie the mailman!

842
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,187
We gotta get you home
before Andy leaves tomorrow!

843
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,772
Tomorrow? But that means...

844
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:06,898
It means
we're busting out of here, tonight.

845
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,818
What? Impossible!
But there's no way out of here!

846
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,238
No, there is one way out.

847
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,781
One way.

848
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:18,243
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

849
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,834
Springy dog.
Present.

850
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,003
Green guys.

851
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,214
Cowgirl.
Here.

852
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:31,757
Horse.

853
00:58:32,925 --> 00:58:34,426
Piggy bank.
Yo.

854
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,637
Tyrannosaurus.
Here.

855
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:38,889
Barbie.
Here.

856
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,850
Potato head.

857
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,394
Potato head?

858
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,314
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!

859
00:58:48,315 --> 00:58:49,691
Impossible!

860
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:52,360
Hey!

861
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,751
Little late
for a stroll, eh, potato head?

862
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,420
That's Mr. Potato head to you,
smoothie.

863
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,548
Well, well, well.
You 're turning out to be

864
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:14,174
quite the troublemaker, aren't you?

865
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,737
What did you think you were
gonna do? Waltz right out of here?

866
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,471
Yeah,
and I would've got away with it, too,

867
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:19,948
if it weren't for you meddling toys!

868
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:21,348
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!

869
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,809
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!

870
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,394
You're a purse with legs.

871
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,354
Ow! Take him back to the box.

872
00:59:27,813 --> 00:59:31,900
No! No, not the box! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.

873
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:34,486
Really. No, no, no!

874
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,071
Okay, check.

875
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:40,284
Good work, lightyear. All right,
resume your, uh, space-guy-thingy.

876
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,703
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!

877
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,376
What do you want?

878
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,880
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go
to the butterfly room. With you!

879
00:59:52,963 --> 00:59:54,983
Yeah, well, you should've
thought of that yesterday.

880
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,299
I was wrong.

881
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:59,511
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your dream house.

882
00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:02,973
Please take me away
from this! Take me away!

883
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:05,392
Darn it, Barbie!

884
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,437
Okay, but things
are complicated around here.

885
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,649
You gotta do what I say.
I will, Ken! I promise!

886
01:00:13,692 --> 01:00:16,486
Wait. I'll do anything!
I'll change your diapers!

887
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:05,035
Go get the tape!

888
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:14,419
And this is where
the magic happens.

889
01:01:15,796 --> 01:01:17,130
Look at all your clothes!

890
01:01:17,214 --> 01:01:19,049
I can't believe
you never brought me up here!

891
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,653
Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
I know, I know, I know.

892
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:23,428
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.

893
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:26,097
Campus hero
with matching sports pennant, huh?

894
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,351
Flower power! Oh, Ken!

895
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:34,189
No one appreciates clothes
here, Barbie. No one.

896
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,235
Ken, would you
model a few outfits for me?

897
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:41,196
Just a few?

898
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:12,978
Go get the key.

899
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,647
Where is it, where is it?

900
01:02:15,689 --> 01:02:17,649
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!

901
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,700
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

902
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,203
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?

903
01:02:30,287 --> 01:02:33,206
I told you,
keep your hands off of my stuff!

904
01:02:33,582 --> 01:02:35,000
Make a move, porky!

905
01:02:36,126 --> 01:02:38,628
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!

906
01:02:40,839 --> 01:02:43,049
Hey! Hey!
Take that, walnut-brain.

907
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:44,300
No wonder you're extinct.

908
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,304
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!

909
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,347
Yoo-hoo!

910
01:02:51,475 --> 01:02:52,851
Help! Prison riot!

911
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,648
Get the tortilla.

912
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,606
Ready?
Ready.

913
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:48,656
Uh, Barbie?

914
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,579
No more games, Ken!
What did lotso do to buzz?

915
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,871
And how do we switch him back?

916
01:03:54,955 --> 01:03:56,873
You can't make me talk. You can't!

917
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,252
But I'd like to see you try.

918
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:54,722
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.

919
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,601
Oh! Barbie! Those were vintage!

920
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,579
It's okay. All right, go ahead,
rip 'em, I don't care.

921
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:00,645
They're a dime a dozen.

922
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:02,480
Ooh, glitter tux.

923
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,402
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?

924
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,654
Oh! A nehru jacket.

925
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,281
Barbie! Not the nehru.

926
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:14,075
This is from what, 1967?

927
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:15,743
The groovy formal collection, yes!

928
01:05:16,036 --> 01:05:19,497
What a shame.
Oh, no, no, no! No!

929
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,166
There's an instruction manual!

930
01:05:22,584 --> 01:05:25,044
Lotso switched buzz to demo mode!

931
01:05:26,296 --> 01:05:28,006
Where's that manual?

932
01:05:29,341 --> 01:05:31,593
I don't know why this couldn't wait
until morning, Ken,

933
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,679
but here you go.

934
01:05:44,606 --> 01:05:45,607
Eesh.

935
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:48,443
What's takin' so doggone long?

936
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,699
So how do we fix buzz?

937
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,136
What are you looking at, feathers?

938
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:17,472
Hey! Ow!

939
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:24,645
Yeah, fly away, you coward.

940
01:06:25,397 --> 01:06:26,523
Uh-oh.

941
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,735
Well, that's just great.

942
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,325
Help! Prison riot!

943
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:39,859
Mayday! Mayday!
Oh, give it up. No one can hear you.

944
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:43,081
Whal:?
I said. “No one an heel-you.

945
01:06:43,832 --> 01:06:45,959
What?
He said, no one can...

946
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,836
Shush! Will you be quiet?

947
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:49,421
Woody! You're back!

948
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,634
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

949
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:57,721
Star command! I've been
taken hostage by my own prisoners.

950
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,600
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!

951
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:03,226
Unhand me, zurg scum!

952
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,937
The galactic courts
will show you no mercy.

953
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,649
It's not working. Why is it not working?
Where's the manual?

954
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:12,253
Here we go! There should be
a little hole under the switch.

955
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:14,946
Little hole, got it!
To reset your buzz lightyear,

956
01:07:14,988 --> 01:07:17,115
insert paperclip...
Rex, use your finger!

957
01:07:17,157 --> 01:07:18,783
What?

958
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:20,618
Okay, now what?
All right, let's see.

959
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,705
Caution. Do not hold button
for more than five seconds.

960
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,293
It's not my fault!

961
01:07:38,011 --> 01:07:40,388
Now what did you do?
I just did what you told me!

962
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:50,190
Uh... Amigos! We're all amigos.

963
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:58,907
We gotta switch him back.

964
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,827
Well, how do we do that?
I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

965
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,871
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El buzzo.

966
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:10,626
Good luck, cowboy.

967
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,884
Here they come.

968
01:08:20,345 --> 01:08:21,846
Come on, buzz!

969
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,099
What took you so long?

970
01:08:25,183 --> 01:08:27,435
Things got complicated.
Where's potato head?

971
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,895
We haven't seen him.

972
01:08:31,356 --> 01:08:32,440
Buzz.

973
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,034
Did you fix buzz?

974
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,328
Uh, sort of.
Behind you.

975
01:08:45,662 --> 01:08:46,954
Someone's coming.

976
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:53,503
You would not believe
what I've been through tonight.

977
01:08:53,545 --> 01:08:55,296
Darling! Are you okay?

978
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,882
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.

979
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:01,094
You've lost weight. And so tall.

980
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,764
Ah! You're a sight for detachable eyes.

981
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:11,772
All clear.

982
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:16,985
Come on. Come on.

983
01:09:19,112 --> 01:09:20,154
We're almost there.

984
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,244
Back up. Back up!

985
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,169
Come on.

986
01:09:51,978 --> 01:09:53,104
(Mummy

987
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,498
Woody!

988
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,335
Come on. We're almost there.

989
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:08,596
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

990
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,318
Oh, way to go, buzz. Come on.

991
01:11:26,656 --> 01:11:29,784
Is it safe?
I guess I'll find out.

992
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,126
Woody? You okay?
Yeah.

993
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,878
Come on down. But not all at once.

994
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:41,963
What did he say?

995
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,149
I think he said, all at once.

996
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:44,507
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

997
01:11:44,549 --> 01:11:45,967
Geronimo!
Look out!

998
01:11:49,721 --> 01:11:50,763
Thanks, Jess.

999
01:11:52,557 --> 01:11:53,558
Almost there, guys.

1000
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:56,227
Slink, you think you can make it?

1001
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:59,605
Well, I might be old,
but I still got a spring in my step.

1002
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:03,901
He did it!
All right, slinkykins.

1003
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:05,654
Okay, climb across.

1004
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:09,741
You lost, little doggie?

1005
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,456
Well, well. Look who's back.

1006
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,090
I 'm sorry, cowboy.

1007
01:12:27,759 --> 01:12:29,093
They broke me.

1008
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:31,887
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

1009
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,599
He don't want you no more.

1010
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:35,892
That's a lie.
Is it?

1011
01:12:36,434 --> 01:12:38,102
Tell me this, sheriff.

1012
01:12:38,186 --> 01:12:41,314
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

1013
01:12:41,773 --> 01:12:43,608
You think you're special, cowboy?

1014
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:48,279
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.

1015
01:12:49,781 --> 01:12:51,532
Speak of the devil.

1016
01:12:57,372 --> 01:13:00,625
Now, we need toys
in our caterpillar room

1017
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:03,336
and you need to avoid that truck.

1018
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,298
Why don't you come on back,
join our family again?

1019
01:13:07,382 --> 01:13:10,885
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!

1020
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:15,306
And I'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours!

1021
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:19,143
Jessie's right! Authority should derive
from the consent of the governed,

1022
01:13:19,185 --> 01:13:20,477
not from the threat of force.

1023
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,773
If that's what you want.

1024
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:28,778
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, lotso.

1025
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,990
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

1026
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,160
Not to me, there's not.

1027
01:13:36,786 --> 01:13:39,330
Fine. Then why don't you join her!

1028
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,751
Oh, Ken!

1029
01:13:43,835 --> 01:13:45,002
Everyone, listen!

1030
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:48,464
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy
if we treated each other fair.

1031
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:51,717
It's lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid,

1032
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:53,511
and he put himself on top!

1033
01:13:53,553 --> 01:13:55,555
Anyone concur with Ken?

1034
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:01,436
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

1035
01:14:01,519 --> 01:14:06,019
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're at the dump.

1036
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,193
Wait! What about Daisy?

1037
01:14:10,445 --> 01:14:12,196
I don't know what you're talking about.

1038
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:14,865
Daisy? You used to do
everything with her?

1039
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,952
Yeah? Then she threw us out.
No.

1040
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:19,829
She lost you.
She replaced us!

1041
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:21,706
She replaced you.

1042
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,630
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

1043
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:26,252
You lied to big baby
and you've been lying ever since.

1044
01:14:27,712 --> 01:14:30,089
Where'd you get that?
She loved you, lotso.

1045
01:14:30,173 --> 01:14:31,382
She never loved me.

1046
01:14:31,424 --> 01:14:33,342
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

1047
01:14:39,015 --> 01:14:41,559
What? You want your mommy back?

1048
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:44,437
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!

1049
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,150
Push 'em in. All of 'em!

1050
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:53,238
This is what happens
when you dummies try to think.

1051
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:57,821
We're all just trash, waiting to be
thrown away! That's all a toy is!

1052
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:02,622
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

1053
01:15:04,749 --> 01:15:07,251
No! No! Wait a minute! Big baby, wait!

1054
01:15:10,296 --> 01:15:12,548
He's gone!
Holy cow.

1055
01:15:17,637 --> 01:15:18,888
Come on. Hurry!

1056
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:26,896
Oh, for crying out loud!

1057
01:15:31,067 --> 01:15:32,193
Woody!

1058
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,783
Oh, boy. Incoming!

1059
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,203
Come on!

1060
01:15:43,663 --> 01:15:44,705
Barbie, no!

1061
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:50,336
Woody!

1062
01:15:59,929 --> 01:16:02,056
Can you hear me?
Is everyone okay?

1063
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,934
Of course not,
you imbecile. We're doomed!

1064
01:16:06,978 --> 01:16:08,437
Everyone, go to buzz. Come on.

1065
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,942
We all here? Slinky? Rex?

1066
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:19,240
Against the wall, everybody.
Quick!

1067
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:22,409
Buzz!

1068
01:16:33,004 --> 01:16:34,005
They'll never make it!

1069
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:44,932
Look out!

1070
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:50,813
V

1071
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,573
Anyone see him?
Over here, y'all. I found him.

1072
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,828
Buzz, you okay?

1073
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:08,998
Buzz'. Buzz'.

1074
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:20,551
That wasn't me, was it?

1075
01:17:20,635 --> 01:17:24,680
Oh, buzz, you're back! You're back,
you're back, you're back, you're back!

1076
01:17:24,722 --> 01:17:27,307
Yes, I'm back. Where have I been?

1077
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:29,644
Beyond infinity, space ranger.

1078
01:17:29,894 --> 01:17:32,897
Woody! So where are we now?

1079
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,400
In a garbage truck
on the way to the dump!

1080
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,707
Hold on, we're going in!

1081
01:18:06,222 --> 01:18:07,723
You got all your pieces?

1082
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:09,391
The claw!

1083
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:12,979
My babies!
Hey, guys! No! No!

1084
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:15,981
No!

1085
01:18:22,113 --> 01:18:23,322
Hang on!

1086
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:37,879
Woody! What do we do?

1087
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:39,672
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...

1088
01:18:40,965 --> 01:18:42,591
Woody!
Slinky!

1089
01:18:44,135 --> 01:18:46,137
It's a magnet! Watch out!

1090
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:49,015
Don't worry, slink,
we'll get you down.

1091
01:18:49,098 --> 01:18:50,766
You might wanna take a look at this.

1092
01:18:54,812 --> 01:18:56,355
Quick! Grab something metal!

1093
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,029
You heard the guy.

1094
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,660
It's not working!

1095
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:15,541
Help! Help me. I'm stuck!

1096
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,419
Help, please! Help!

1097
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,212
Woody!

1098
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,508
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.

1099
01:19:27,428 --> 01:19:28,429
Woody!

1100
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:39,357
Go, go!

1101
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:46,739
Thank you, sheriff.

1102
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,032
We're all in this together.

1103
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:49,450
Right, guys?

1104
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:51,952
Guys?

1105
01:19:52,203 --> 01:19:54,371
Woody! Down here!

1106
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,043
Woody!
Oh, boy.

1107
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,381
Woody, look. I can see daylight.

1108
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:05,215
We're gonna be okay!

1109
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,176
Hey!

1110
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:09,511
I don't think that's daylight.

1111
01:20:33,619 --> 01:20:37,247
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

1112
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,374
Come on!

1113
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:42,211
Go. Go! Hit the button!

1114
01:20:49,802 --> 01:20:50,928
Hurry!

1115
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,726
Just push it! Push it!
Push it!

1116
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:00,187
Where's your kid now, sheriff?

1117
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:01,856
No. No!

1118
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:03,107
Lotso!

1119
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,928
Buzz! What do we do?

1120
01:22:53,342 --> 01:22:55,135
The claw.

1121
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:25,916
You know all that bad stuff I said
about Andy's attic?

1122
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,251
I take it all back.

1123
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:29,336
You're darn tootin'.
You said it.

1124
01:23:35,718 --> 01:23:38,554
Oh, darling. You were so brave.

1125
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:43,434
You saved our lives.
And we are eternally grateful.

1126
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,103
My boys!

1127
01:23:46,145 --> 01:23:47,396
Daddy!

1128
01:23:47,813 --> 01:23:49,940
Hey! Where's that fur ball lotso?

1129
01:23:49,982 --> 01:23:52,025
Yeah. I'd like to loosen his stitchin'.

1130
01:23:52,276 --> 01:23:54,861
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.

1131
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:05,748
Hey!
What you got?

1132
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,334
I had me one of these when I was a kid.

1133
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:10,962
Strawberries.

1134
01:24:13,005 --> 01:24:14,339
Impenng

1135
01:24:14,757 --> 01:24:17,634
hey, buddy. You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

1136
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,560
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.

1137
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:29,063
That's right, college boy.
Wait.

1138
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:31,148
What about you guys? I mean,

1139
01:24:32,483 --> 01:24:34,818
maybe the attic's not such a great idea.

1140
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:39,778
We're Andy's toys, Woody.
We'll be there for him, together.

1141
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:43,994
I just hope he hasn't left yet.
Wait a minute!

1142
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:45,787
Wait, I'll check!

1143
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:47,665
Andy's still packing.

1144
01:24:47,748 --> 01:24:49,833
But he's almost done!

1145
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:53,670
He lives halfway across town.
We'll never get there in time!

1146
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:10,479
Come on, buster.

1147
01:25:10,521 --> 01:25:11,957
Is that it, honey?
You got everything?

1148
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:13,691
Yeah. Just a few more boxes
in my room.

1149
01:25:13,733 --> 01:25:14,734
Okay. Come on.

1150
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:19,590
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

1151
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,532
All right. Go. Go, go!

1152
01:25:29,957 --> 01:25:31,291
Okay. All clear.

1153
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:41,260
Oh, there you are.

1154
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,560
There you go.
Buzz.

1155
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:56,942
This isn't goodbye.
Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

1156
01:25:57,276 --> 01:25:58,902
Yeah, but not too much fun.

1157
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:03,073
Woody, take care of Andy.
Yeah.

1158
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:05,784
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.

1159
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:07,662
Sure thing.

1160
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:11,707
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?

1161
01:26:12,124 --> 01:26:15,252
'Course I will. Besides, I know about

1162
01:26:15,294 --> 01:26:17,921
buzz's Spanish mode.
My what?

1163
01:26:17,963 --> 01:26:19,756
Honey, you want
some food for the road?

1164
01:26:19,799 --> 01:26:21,217
I'll get something on the way.

1165
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,261
You know where to find us, cowboy.

1166
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:40,611
Did you say goodbye to Molly?

1167
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,738
Mom, we've said goodbye
like 10 times.

1168
01:26:46,033 --> 01:26:48,035
Oh, Andy.

1169
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,503
Mom, it's okay.

1170
01:26:59,046 --> 01:27:01,131
I know. It's just...

1171
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,595
I wish I could always be with you.

1172
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,474
You will be, mom.

1173
01:27:26,073 --> 01:27:27,991
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye
to buster?

1174
01:27:28,075 --> 01:27:30,285
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?

1175
01:27:30,369 --> 01:27:33,246
Who's a good doggy? I'm gonna
miss you. I'm gonna miss you.

1176
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:42,214
I'm gonna miss you.
Don't, Andy.

1177
01:27:43,382 --> 01:27:46,968
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.

1178
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:48,743
Come on.
Get the rest of your things.

1179
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:52,015
Okay, buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

1180
01:27:58,564 --> 01:27:59,648
Hey.

1181
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:10,576
Hey, mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?

1182
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:13,870
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.

1183
01:28:41,732 --> 01:28:44,234
Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!

1184
01:28:44,318 --> 01:28:47,946
Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts.

1185
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:50,490
Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!

1186
01:28:50,741 --> 01:28:52,284
Splat! Splat! Splat!

1187
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:56,371
Andy?

1188
01:28:56,413 --> 01:28:58,081
Wow. Look at you.

1189
01:28:58,749 --> 01:29:00,208
Well, I hear you're off to college.

1190
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:02,169
Yeah. Right now, actually.

1191
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:04,380
So, what can we do for you?

1192
01:29:04,463 --> 01:29:06,590
Uh, I have some toys here.

1193
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,592
Ooh. You hear that, Bonnie?

1194
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:11,303
So, you're Bonnie?

1195
01:29:12,471 --> 01:29:13,472
I'm Andy.

1196
01:29:14,473 --> 01:29:17,476
Someone told me
you're really good with toys.

1197
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:21,438
These are mine,
but I'm going away now,

1198
01:29:22,481 --> 01:29:24,608
so I need someone really special
to play with them.

1199
01:29:32,908 --> 01:29:35,952
This is Jessie, the roughest,
toughest cowgirl in the whole west.

1200
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:40,498
She loves critters, but none more
than her best pal, bullseye.

1201
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:43,544
Yee-haw!

1202
01:29:43,627 --> 01:29:44,628
Here.

1203
01:29:58,183 --> 01:30:02,683
This is Rex, the meanest, most
terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!

1204
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:12,906
The potato heads. Mr. and Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,

1205
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:15,159
'cause they're madly in love.

1206
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:19,288
Now slinky here is
as loyal as any dog you could want.

1207
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:22,166
And hamm,
he'll keep your money safe,

1208
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:27,125
but he's also one of the most dastardly
villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork chop.

1209
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:33,677
These little dudes
are from a strange alien world.

1210
01:30:34,094 --> 01:30:35,428
Pizza planet.

1211
01:30:37,097 --> 01:30:38,348
And this

1212
01:30:40,809 --> 01:30:44,145
is buzz lightyear, the coolest toy ever!

1213
01:30:44,521 --> 01:30:47,315
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!

1214
01:30:47,858 --> 01:30:51,027
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil emperor zurg.

1215
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:55,407
To infinity and beyond!

1216
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,536
Now, you gotta promise
to take good care of these guys.

1217
01:31:01,705 --> 01:31:05,333
They mean a lot to me.

1218
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:12,549
My cowboy!

1219
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:18,596
Woody? What's he doing in there?

1220
01:31:19,723 --> 01:31:22,392
There's a snake in my boot.
Wha...?

1221
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:26,563
There 's a snake in my boat.

1222
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:44,915
Now, Woody, he's been my pal
for as long as I can remember.

1223
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:48,752
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

1224
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:50,796
And kind. And smart.

1225
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:56,718
But the thing that makes Woody special
is he'll never give up on you.

1226
01:31:58,095 --> 01:31:59,221
Ever.

1227
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:02,808
He'll be there for you, no matter what.

1228
01:32:06,645 --> 01:32:09,439
You think you can
take care of him for me?

1229
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:11,567
Okay then.

1230
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:25,622
Oh, no! Dr. Pork chop's attacking
the haunted bakery!

1231
01:32:26,915 --> 01:32:29,167
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'“ stop 'em'.!

1232
01:32:29,251 --> 01:32:30,794
Buzz lightyear to the rescue!

1233
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,630
And we'll actually need
the rocket.

1234
01:32:34,089 --> 01:32:36,633
They're getting away!
Come on, bullseye!

1235
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:42,723
We need to get in the
spaceship. The volcano is gonna erupt.

1236
01:32:42,806 --> 01:32:45,642
Look! They're being attacked
by a real dog!

1237
01:32:45,684 --> 01:32:47,102
You can eat my poisonous scones!

1238
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:49,312
Mr. and Mrs. Potato head
are in trouble.

1239
01:32:49,396 --> 01:32:50,939
Get on, Woody.

1240
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:54,443
It's my friend Woody.

1241
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:58,113
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.

1242
01:33:25,557 --> 01:33:27,016
Thanks, guys.

1243
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,649
Look, mommy.
They're all playing together.

1244
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:35,191
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

1245
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,041
So long, partner.

1246
01:33:56,046 --> 01:33:59,424
Oh, hey, buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.

1247
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:02,219
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.

1248
01:34:32,624 --> 01:34:33,833
New toys!

1249
01:34:46,513 --> 01:34:47,680
Noses.

1250
01:36:06,802 --> 01:36:11,139
So I guess you could say
sunnyside is sunny once again!

1251
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:14,684
Hope to hear from you soon. We're all
super excited about your new home.

1252
01:36:14,768 --> 01:36:17,353
Hugs and kisses to everyone.

1253
01:36:17,437 --> 01:36:18,771
Aw!

1254
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,650
That Barbie
has some nice handwriting.

1255
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:24,861
Uh, buzz,
Barbie didn't write this.

1256
01:36:27,489 --> 01:36:28,698
Grab the sword!
I got it!

1257
01:36:28,782 --> 01:36:30,009
Okay, go for the...
Triple bonus!

1258
01:36:30,033 --> 01:36:31,177
Watch out!
We got the cloak of darkness!

1259
01:36:31,201 --> 01:36:33,953
Run, run!
My arms are never long enough!

1260
01:36:34,037 --> 01:36:35,872
I'll do it! This is it! This is it!

1261
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,624
Yes!
We did it!

1262
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:40,585
High-five! Hold on.

1263
01:36:43,171 --> 01:36:45,548
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.

1264
01:36:45,632 --> 01:36:49,302
Oh, look at this!
Golly Bob howdy! That's me!

1265
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:52,722
We're all up here!
Hey, chuckles, lookin' good.

1266
01:36:52,764 --> 01:36:55,099
Yeah, she really got your smile.

1267
01:36:57,269 --> 01:36:58,645
Whee! Whee! Whee!

1268
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,313
Oh! Oh!

1269
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:03,859
What the...

1270
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:08,572
I told you kids!
Stay out of my butt!

1271
01:37:09,614 --> 01:37:13,075
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

1272
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:16,746
Romeo, o Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

1273
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,416
Next season, we're doing cats.

1274
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:22,127
Or might I suggest Hamlet?

1275
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:26,089
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.

1276
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:28,341
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

1277
01:37:30,969 --> 01:37:32,095
Huh?

1278
01:37:39,519 --> 01:37:41,646
I don't know what came over me.

1279
01:37:42,939 --> 01:37:44,649
Just go with it, buzz.

1
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,632
Agnarr: Anna. Elsa.

2
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,975
Iduna: Bedtime soon.

3
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,973
Uh-oh. The Princess is trapped

4
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,603
in the snow goblin's evil spell.

5
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,394
Quick, Elsa! Make a prince!
A fancy one!

6
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,646
Oh, no!
The prince is trapped, too.

7
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,269
Who cares about danger

8
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,437
when there's love?

9
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,151
Ugh, Anna. Bleugh!

10
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,240
Kissing won't save the forest.

11
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,618
The lost fairies cry out.

12
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,183
What sound does a giraffe make?

13
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,287
Never mind.

14
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,539
They wake the fairy queen...

15
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,375
Who breaks the spell
and saves everyone!

16
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,335
And they all get married!

17
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,833
What are you playing?

18
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,464
Enchanted forest.

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,861
The prince and the Princess...

20
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,297
Hmm. That's like no enchanted
forest I've ever seen.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,296
You've seen an enchanted forest?

22
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,384
Wait, what?

23
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,473
I have. Once.

24
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,094
And you've never
told us this before?

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,221
Well, I could tell you now,
if you...

26
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,395
- Okay. Now.
- Tell us now.

27
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,017
Are you sure about this?

28
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,478
It's time they know.

29
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,217
Let's make a big snowman later.

30
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,777
If they can settle and listen.

31
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,952
Far away...

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,945
As north as we can go...

33
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,745
Stood a very old
and very enchanted forest.

34
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,705
But its magic wasn't that of

35
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,167
goblin spells and lost fairies.

36
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,541
It was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all...

37
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,801
Those of air...

38
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,465
Of fire...

39
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,759
Of wafer...

40
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,258
And earth.

41
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,684
But it was also home

42
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,690
fo the mysterious
northuldra people.

43
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,527
Young Elsa: Were the
northuldra magical, like me?

44
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,238
Agnarr: No, Elsa.
They were not magical.

45
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,609
They just took advantage
of the forest's gifts.

46
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,453
Their ways
were so different from ours...

47
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,198
But still,
they promised us friendship.

48
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,166
In honor of that,

49
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,123
your grandfather, king runeard,

50
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,582
built them a mighty dam...

51
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,330
To strengthen their waters.

52
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,086
It was a gift of peace.

53
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,210
Young Anna:
That's a big gift of peace.

54
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,086
Agnarr: And I was so honored

55
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,050
to get to go to the forest
to celebrate it.

56
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,423
Runeard: Stand tall, agnarr.

57
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,884
Agnarr: I wasn't at all prepared

58
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,268
for what the day would bring.

59
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,605
We let down our guard.

60
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,941
We were charmed.

61
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,611
Whoa. Whoa!

62
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,777
It felt so...

63
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,944
Magical.

64
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,297
But something went wrong.

65
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,926
They were attacking us.

66
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,803
Get behind me.

67
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,178
Agnarr: It was a brutal battle.

68
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,831
Your grandfather...

69
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,890
Father!

70
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,974
Agnarr: Was lost.

71
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,103
Aah!

72
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,186
Agnarr: The fighting
enraged the spirits.

73
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,358
Fighter: Look out!

74
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,603
Agnarr: They turned
their magic against us all.

75
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,949
There was this voice...

76
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,089
Ahd someone saved me.

77
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,420
I'm told
the spirits then vanished.

78
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,675
And a powerful mist
covered the forest.

79
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,097
Locking everyone out.

80
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:41,278
And that night, I came home
king of arendelle.

81
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,775
Whoa, papa, that was epic.

82
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,028
Whoever saved you,

83
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,196
I love them.

84
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,114
I wish I knew who it was.

85
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,283
What happened to the spirits?

86
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,785
What's in the forest now?

87
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,503
I don't know.

88
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,998
The mist still stands.

89
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,920
No one can get in.

90
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,793
And no one has since come out.

91
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,136
So we're safe.

92
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,299
Yes.

93
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,343
But the forest could wake again.

94
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,344
And we must be prepared for
whatever danger it may bring.

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,811
Iduna: And on that note,

96
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,375
how about we say good night
to your father?

97
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,891
But I still have
so many questions.

98
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,859
Save them
for another night, Anna.

99
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,738
You know I don't have
that kind of Patience.

100
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,700
Why did northuldra
attack us anyway?

101
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,785
Who attacks people
who give them gifts?

102
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,656
Do you think
the forest will wake again?

103
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,951
Only ahtohallan knows.

104
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,957
Octa-who-what?

105
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,041
When I was little...

106
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,796
My mother would sing a song

107
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,383
about a special river
called ahtohallan...

108
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,427
That was said to hold all
the answers about the past.

109
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,641
About what we are a part of.

110
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,805
Wow.

111
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,891
Will you sing it for us? Please?

112
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,643
Okay.

113
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,641
Cuddle close.

114
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,936
Scooch in.

115
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,658
Where the northwind

116
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,949
meelis the sea

117
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,077
there's a river

118
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,167
full of memory

119
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:24,211
sleep, my darling,
safe and sound

120
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:29,052
for in this river, all is found

121
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,054
in her waters

122
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,973
deep and true

123
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,143
lie the answers

124
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,767
and a path for you

125
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,858
dive down deep into her sound

126
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,489
but not too far
or you'll be drowned

127
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:01,832
yes, she will sing
to those who hear

128
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:08,459
and in her song, all magic flows

129
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:13,426
but can you brave
what you most fear?

130
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:20,764
Can you face
what the river knows?

131
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,060
Where the northwind

132
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,279
meelis the sea

133
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,524
there's a mother

134
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,698
full of memory

135
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,415
come, my darling, homeward bound

136
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,826
when all is lost

137
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:49,254
then all is found

138
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,804
- your majesty.
- Oh!

139
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,964
They're ready.

140
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,470
Excuse me.

141
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,219
I'm coming.

142
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,003
Do you hear that?

143
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,062
What?

144
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,194
Never mind.

145
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,050
Enjoying
your new permafrost, olaf?

146
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,921
I'm just living the dream, Anna.

147
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,009
How I wish

148
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,594
- this could last forever.
- Mmm.

149
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,094
And yet, change mocks us
with her beauty.

150
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,265
What's that?

151
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,396
Forgive me.
Maturity is making me poetic.

152
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,391
Tell me, you're older
and thus all-knowing...

153
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,519
Do you ever worry
about the notion that...

154
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,236
Nothing is permanent?

155
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,196
Uh... no.

156
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,485
Really?

157
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,322
Wow, I can't wait until
I'm ancient like you...

158
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,117
So I don't have to worry
about important things.

159
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,372
That's not what I mean.

160
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,412
I don't worry because...

161
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,254
Well, I have you and Elsa
and kristoff and sven...

162
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,756
And the gates are open wide...

163
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,625
And I'm not alone anymore.

164
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,880
Yes, the wind blows
a little bit colder

165
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,802
and we're all getting older

166
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:25,054
and the clouds are moving on
with every Autumn breeze

167
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,893
Peter pumpkin
just became fertilizer

168
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,563
and my leafs a little sadder
and wiser

169
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:35,064
that's why I rely
oh certain certainties

170
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,321
yes, some things never change

171
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,615
like the feel
of your hand in mine

172
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,371
some things stay the same

173
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,492
like how we get along just fine

174
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,620
like an old stone wall
that'll never fall

175
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,338
some things are always true!

176
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,010
Some things never change

177
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,380
like how
I'm holding on tight to you

178
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,515
the leaves are already falling

179
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,310
sven, it feels
like the future is calling

180
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,773
are you telling me tonight

181
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,311
you're gonna get down
on one knee?

182
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,404
Yeah, but I'm really bad
at planning these things out

183
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,074
like candlelight
and pulling of rings out

184
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,867
maybe you should leave
all the romantic stuff to me!

185
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,450
Yeah, some things never change

186
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,918
like the love
that I feel for her

187
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,754
some things stay the same

188
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,999
like how reindeers are easier

189
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,919
but if I commit and I go for it

190
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,797
I'll know what to say and do!

191
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:42,968
Right?

192
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,468
Some things never change

193
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,936
sven, the pressure is all on you

194
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,977
The winds are restless

195
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,231
could that be why
I'm hearing this call?

196
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,982
Is something coming?

197
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,111
I'm not sure
I want things to change at all

198
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,953
these days are precious

199
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,869
can't let them slip away

200
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,202
I can't freeze this moment

201
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:18,208
but I can still go out
and seize this day!

202
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,757
Oh!

203
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,057
The wind blows
a little bit colder

204
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,776
and you all look
a little bit older

205
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,649
it's time to count our blessings

206
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,282
beneath an Autumn sky

207
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,117
we'll always live
in a kingdom of plenty

208
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,783
that stands
for the good of the many!

209
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,034
And I promise you the flag of
arendelle will always fly!

210
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,661
Our flag will always fly!

211
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,832
Our flag will always fly
our flag will always fly

212
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,835
some things never change

213
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,962
turn around
ahd the time has flown

214
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,261
some things stay the same

215
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,475
though the future
remains unknown

216
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,220
may our good luck last
may our past be past

217
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,145
time's moving fast, it's true

218
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,360
some things never change

219
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,110
and I'm holding on tight to you

220
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,653
holding on tight to you

221
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,991
- holding on tight to you
- Holding on tight to you

222
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,874
I'm holding on tight to you

223
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,711
Kristoff: Uh, okay. Um, lion?

224
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,882
Grizzly bear?

225
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,012
- Uh, monster?
- Brown bear?

226
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,298
- Angry face?
- Black bear?

227
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,466
- Kristoff: Uh...
- Hans?

228
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,760
Unredeemable monster?

229
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,873
Greatest mistake of your life?

230
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,228
Wouldn't even kiss you?

231
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,643
Villain!

232
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,024
All: Ohl

233
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,149
we all kind of got it.

234
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,439
Okay, olaf, you're up.

235
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,565
Okay.

236
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,445
So much easier
now that I can read.

237
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,526
Sven: Mm.

238
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,657
Lightning round,
boys against girls.

239
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,618
Kristoff: Okay, I'm ready,
I'm ready. Go.

240
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,616
Unicorn.

241
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,826
Ice cream!

242
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,490
Castle! Oaken!

243
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,288
Teapot! Mouse!

244
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,040
Oh! Elsal

245
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,923
I don't think
olaf should get to rearrange.

246
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,696
Doesn't matter. This is gonna
be a cinch.

247
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,302
Two sisters, one mind.

248
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,046
- Thank you.
- Anna: Okay.

249
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,422
Here we go.

250
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,140
You got this, Elsa.

251
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,013
Elsa: Hmm. Anna: Anytime.

252
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,685
Just do it with your body.

253
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,891
Uh, nothing?

254
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,436
Air? Tree? People?

255
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,899
Treeple? Oh, that's not a word.

256
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,893
Oh, shovel boy? Teeth?

257
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,026
Oh! Doing the dishes?

258
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,191
- Polar bear?
- Hey.

259
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,525
- Sorry.
- Uh... ugh.

260
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,635
Anna: You gotta
give me something.

261
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,866
Um...

262
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,742
Anna: Oh! Uh, alarmed?

263
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,612
Distracted?

264
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,202
Um, worried?
Panicking? Disturbed?

265
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,491
Oh, come on, you definitely

266
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,250
look disturbed.

267
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,331
We won.

268
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,415
Rematch?

269
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,502
Oh, you know what?
I think I'll turn in.

270
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,669
Are you okay?

271
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,918
Elsa: Just... just tired.

272
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,302
Good night.

273
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,825
Yeah, I'm tired, too.

274
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,931
And sven promised to read me
a bedtime story.

275
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,591
Didn't you, sven?

276
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,763
Did 1?

277
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,894
Oh, you do the best voices!

278
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,514
Like when you pretend to be
kristoff, and you're like...

279
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,545
"I just
need to go talk to some rocks

280
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,934
"about my childhood and stuff."

281
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,602
Um, how about you guys

282
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,316
start without me?

283
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,693
Ugh.

284
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,828
Did Elsa seem weird to you?

285
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,699
- She seemed like Elsa.
- Hmm.

286
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,208
That last word

287
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,209
really seemed to throw her.
What was it?

288
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,829
- I don't know. Ahem.
- No. No.

289
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,580
I don't know, but... “Ah.

290
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,169
"Ice"?

291
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,880
Oh, come on!

292
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,885
She couldn't act out ice?

293
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,675
- I better go check on her.
- Uh...

294
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,555
- Thanks, honey. Love you.
- Hmm?

295
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,434
Love you, too.

296
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,304
It's fine.

297
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,559
Elsa: Come in.

298
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,816
Yep. Something's wrong.

299
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,780
- With you?
- No, with you.

300
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,691
You're wearing mother's scarf.

301
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,819
You do that
when something's wrong.

302
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,736
Did we hurt your feelings?

303
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,238
I'm so sorry if we did.

304
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,703
You know, very few people are
actually good at family games.

305
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,787
That's just a fact.

306
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,044
No, that's not it.

307
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,662
Then, what is it?

308
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,921
There's this...

309
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,639
I just don't wanna
mess things up.

310
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,804
What things? You're doing great.

311
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,017
Oh, Elsa, when are you
going to see yourself

312
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,396
the way I see you?

313
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,434
What would I do without you?

314
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,778
You'll always have me.

315
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,027
I know what you need.

316
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,282
Come on, come here. “What?

317
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,612
In mama's words,

318
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,404
- "cuddle close, scooch in."
- Mm-hmm.

319
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,368
Where the northwind

320
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,745
meelis the sea

321
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,623
there's a river

322
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,042
full of memory

323
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,051
I know what you're doing.

324
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,682
Sleep, my darling,
safe and sound

325
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,645
for in this river, all is found

326
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,735
I can hear you

327
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,399
but I won't

328
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,822
some look for trouble

329
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,612
while others don't

330
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:22,239
there's a thousand reasons
I should go about my day

331
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:27,836
and ignore your whispers
which I wish would go away, oh

332
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,585
oh

333
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,469
You're not a voice

334
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,097
you're just a ringing in my ear

335
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,757
and if I heard you

336
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,971
which I don't

337
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,436
I'm spoken for, I fear

338
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,649
everyone I've ever loved
is here within these walls

339
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,935
I'm sorry, secret siren

340
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,320
but I'm blocking out your calls

341
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,441
I've had my adventure
I don't need something new

342
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,617
I'm afraid of what I'm risking
if I follow you

343
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,787
into the unknown

344
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:11,379
into the unknown

345
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,919
into the unknown

346
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,891
What do you want?

347
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,564
'Cause you've been
keeping me awake

348
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,351
are you here to distract me

349
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,603
so I make a big mistake?

350
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,403
Or are you someone out there

351
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,822
who's a little bit like me

352
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,742
who knows deep down

353
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,242
I'm not where I'm meant to be?

354
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,120
Every day's a little harder

355
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,793
as I feel my power grow

356
00:18:54,925 --> 00:19:00,045
don't you know there's
part of me that longs to go

357
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:04,595
into the unknown?

358
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:09,019
Into the unknown!

359
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,517
Into the unknown!

360
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,021
Whoa-oh-oh

361
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,031
are you out there?
Do you know me?

362
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,529
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?

363
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,972
Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone

364
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:52,814
how do I follow you

365
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:59,063
into the unknown?

366
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,039
Air, fire, water, earth.

367
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,803
Woman: The water!

368
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,897
The air rages,
no fire, no water.

369
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,398
The earth is next.

370
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,650
We have to get out.

371
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,999
It'll be okay.
Evacuate to the cliffs.

372
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,425
Oh, no! I'm gonna blow!

373
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,007
I've got you!

374
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,391
Kristoff: Yes.
Everyone's out and safe.

375
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,023
- Here. Take one of these.
- Sven: Huh?

376
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,274
You okay there, olaf?

377
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,359
Oh, yeah. We're calling this...

378
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,647
"Controlling what you can when
things feel out of control."

379
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,361
Okay, I don't understand.

380
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,030
You've been hearing a voice

381
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,909
and you didn't think to tell me?

382
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,199
I didn't want to worry you.

383
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,119
We made a promise
not to shut each other out.

384
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,001
Just tell me what's going on.

385
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,710
I woke the magical spirits
at the enchanted forest.

386
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,424
Okay, that's definitely not

387
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,879
what I thought
you were gonna say.

388
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,594
Wait. The enchanted forest?

389
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,384
The one father warned us about?

390
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,468
Yes.

391
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,849
Why would you do that?

392
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,343
Because of the voice.

393
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,267
I know it sounds crazy...

394
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,061
But I believe whoever
is calling me is good.

395
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,935
How can you say that?
Look at our kingdom.

396
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,152
I know. It's just that
my magic can feel it.

397
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,774
I can feel it.

398
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,235
Okay.

399
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,904
Oh, no. What now?

400
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,997
Kristoff: The trolls?

401
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,038
- Kristoff! We missed you!
- Oh!

402
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,707
Pabbie.

403
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,668
Well, never a dull moment
with you two.

404
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,130
I hope you're prepared
for what you have done, Elsa.

405
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,721
Angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart.

406
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,761
Why are they still angry?

407
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,773
What does all of this
have to do with arendelle?

408
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,973
Let me see what I can see.

409
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,313
The past is not what it seems.

410
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,983
A wrong demands to be righted.

411
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,028
Arendelle is not safe.

412
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,493
The truth must be found.

413
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,782
Without it...

414
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,157
I see no future.

415
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,375
No future?

416
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,790
When one can see no future...

417
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,298
All one can do
is the next right thing.

418
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,963
The next right thing

419
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,653
is for me to go
to the enchanted forest...

420
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,296
And find that voice.

421
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,702
Kristoff, can I borrow
your wagon

422
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,761
and sven? Sven: Hmm?

423
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,413
I'm not very comfortable
with the idea of that.

424
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,678
- You are not going alone.
- Anna, no.

425
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,222
I have my powers
to protect me. You don't.

426
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,961
Excuse me, I climbed
the north mountain...

427
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,020
Survived a frozen heart,

428
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,255
and saved you
from my ex-boyfriend...

429
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,644
And I did it all without powers,

430
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,174
so, you know, I'm coming.

431
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,563
Me, too. I'll drive.

432
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,073
I'll bring the snacks!

433
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,199
I will look after your people.

434
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,369
Please make sure they stay

435
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,869
out of the kingdom
until we return.

436
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,488
Of course.

437
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,035
Let's let them know.

438
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,955
Anna, I am worried for her.

439
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,543
We have always feared

440
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,171
Elsa's powers were too much
for this world.

441
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,758
Now, we must pray
they are enough.

442
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,633
I won't let anything
happen to her.

443
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,597
Olaf: Hyah!

444
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,844
Olaf: Who's into trivia?

445
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,562
I am. Okay.

446
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,228
Did you know that water
has memory? True fact.

447
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,393
It's disputed by many,
but it's true.

448
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,814
Did you know men are six times

449
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,400
more likely
to be struck by lightning?

450
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,648
Did you know gorillas burp
when they're happy?

451
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,117
Did you know we blink
four million times a day?

452
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,110
Did you know
wombats poop squares?

453
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,600
Kristoff: Did you know
sleeping quietly

454
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,364
on long journeys
prevents insanity?

455
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,229
Olaf: Yeah, that's not true.
Kristoff: Ltis.

456
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,481
Anna: It's true.
Elsa: Definitely true.

457
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,024
Anna: No, it's the truth.

458
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,458
Olaf: Well, that was unanimous.

459
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,422
But I will look it up
when we get home.

460
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,590
They're both asleep.

461
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,798
So, what do you wanna do?

462
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,936
Sven, keep us steady, will ya?

463
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,605
- Hmm...
- Anna. Ahem.

464
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,795
- Anna?
- Mm-hmm?

465
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,525
Remember
our first trip like this...

466
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,770
When I said
you'd have to be crazy

467
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,529
to want to marry
a man you just met?

468
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,235
Wait, what? Crazy?

469
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,780
You didn't say I was crazy.
You think I'm crazy?

470
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,410
No. I did.

471
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,279
- You were...
- Sven: Huh?

472
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,447
Not crazy.

473
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,823
Clearly.

474
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,537
Just naive.

475
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,254
Not naive. Just, uh,
new to love. Like I was.

476
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:12,667
And when you're new,
you're bound to get it wrong.

477
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,714
So you're saying
I'm wrong for you.

478
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,883
What? No, no. I'm not saying

479
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,389
you're wrong, or crazy.

480
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,551
- Kristoff, stop. Please.
- Good idea.

481
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,223
I hear it. I hear the voice.

482
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,640
You do?

483
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,556
Olaf, wake up.

484
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,232
Whoa. “Wow.

485
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,004
Whoa! What the...

486
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,658
Anna: Whoa.

487
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,501
Promise me,
we do this together, okay?

488
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,040
I promise.

489
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,846
It's okay.

490
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,136
Did you know
that an enchanted forest

491
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,801
is a place of transformation?

492
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,724
I have no idea
what that means...

493
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,642
But I can't wait to see

494
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,058
what it's gonna do
to each one of us.

495
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,936
Elsa: Hey!
Kristoff: What is this?

496
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,425
Anna: No pushing.
Kristoff: Stop it.

497
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,089
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Elsa: It's too fast.

498
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,566
What was that?

499
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,903
Anna: No. No, no, no.

500
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,831
Anna: And we're locked in.

501
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,516
Probably should have seen
that one coming.

502
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,087
This forest is beautiful.

503
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,835
Olaf: Ooh.

504
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,451
The dam. It still stands.

505
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,241
It was
in grand pabbie's visions.

506
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,738
But why?

507
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,662
I don't know, but it's still
in good shape. Thank goodness.

508
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,874
What do you mean?

509
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,035
Well, if that dam broke...

510
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,163
It would send
a tidal wave so big

511
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,547
it would wash away everything
on this fjord.

512
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,132
Everything?

513
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,009
But arendelle's on this fjord.

514
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,713
Nothing's gonna happen
to arendelle, Anna.

515
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,005
It's gonna be fine.

516
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,928
Come here.

517
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,273
You know,
under different circumstances,

518
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,607
this would be a, uh,
pretty romantic place.

519
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,690
Don't you think?

520
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,775
Different circumstances?

521
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,051
You mean,
like with someone else?

522
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,815
What? No! No.

523
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,279
I'm saying...

524
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,556
Just in case we don't make it
out of here...

525
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,615
Wait, what?

526
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,058
You don't think we're gonna
make it out of here?

527
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,117
No. Nol

528
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,998
I mean, no,
we will make it out of here.

529
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,521
Well, technically the odds are
kind of complicated,

530
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,745
but my point is...

531
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,287
In case we die...

532
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,789
- You think we're gonna die?
- No! No, no, no.

533
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,069
- Where's Elsa?
- We will die at some point.

534
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,321
Anna: I swore that
I wouldn't leave her side.

535
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,572
Kristoff: Not in any
recent time will we die.

536
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,990
- Anna: Elsa!
- But way far in the future,

537
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,345
we will die.

538
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,385
Don't patronize me.

539
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,353
Elsal

540
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,775
there you are.

541
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,864
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

542
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,608
Okay, good.

543
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,576
Where's olaf?

544
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,199
Um...

545
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,364
Anna”?

546
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,123
Elsa?

547
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,708
Sven?

548
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,873
Samantha?

549
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,291
I don't even know a Samantha.

550
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,462
Whoa!

551
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,052
Mm.

552
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,436
That's normal.

553
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,783
What was that?

554
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,032
Samantha?

555
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,419
This will all
make sense when I am older

556
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,590
someday I will see
that this makes sense

557
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:08,049
one day when I'm old and wise
I'll think back and realize

558
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,344
that these were all
completely normal events!

559
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,847
I'll have all the answers
when I'm older

560
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:22,192
like why we're in this
dark enchanted wood

561
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,437
I know in a couple years

562
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,445
these will seem
like childish fears

563
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,278
and so I know this isn't bad,
it's good

564
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,696
excuse me

565
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,330
growing up means adapting

566
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,205
puzzling out your world
and your place

567
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:43,627
when I'm more mature
I'll feel totally secure

568
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,752
being watched by something
with a creepy, creepy face

569
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,433
See, that will all make sense
when I am older

570
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,023
so there's no need
to be terrified or tense

571
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,574
I'll just dream about a time

572
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,411
when I'm in my aged prime

573
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,951
'cause when you're older

574
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:22,295
absolutely everything
makes sense!

575
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,662
This is fine.

576
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,545
- Olaf: Whoa!
- Olaf!

577
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,380
Hey, guys.

578
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,348
Meet the wind spirit.

579
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,430
Kristoff: Coming through!

580
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,353
Ooh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

581
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,232
I'd hold your hair back,
but I can't find my arms.

582
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,858
Hey! Stop!

583
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,167
Elsal

584
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,008
Anna: Let her go!

585
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,761
Kristoff: Anna, be careful!

586
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,009
That's my sister!

587
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,768
Mattias: Prince agnarr!

588
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,853
For arendelle.

589
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,732
Fighter: Look out!

590
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,682
Young agnarr: Father!

591
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,666
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

592
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,090
What are these?

593
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,844
Oh, they look like
moments in time.

594
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,388
What's that thing you say, olaf?

595
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,053
The thing... oh!

596
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,058
My theory
about advancing technologies

597
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,560
as both our savior and our doom?

598
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,892
No, not that one.
The one about...

599
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,181
- The one about cucumbers?
- No.

600
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,269
The thing about water.

601
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,685
Oh! Yeah. Water has memory.

602
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,527
The water
that makes up you and me

603
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,564
has passed through
at least four humans...

604
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,573
And/or animals before us.

605
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,488
Anna: Hmm.

606
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,286
And remembers everything.

607
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,540
The wind's back.

608
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,746
Delicious.

609
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,666
I think I'll name you Gale.

610
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,211
Get out of there. Whoa!

611
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,709
- Oh. Hi.
- Aren't you curious?

612
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,714
You in a better mood now?

613
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,060
Father. That's father.

614
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,314
This girl.

615
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,111
Olaf: She's saving him.

616
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,075
She's northuldra.

617
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,745
What is that?

618
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,660
Elsa: Olaf, get behind me.

619
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,564
What are you gonna do with that?

620
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,703
I have no idea.

621
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,135
Lower your weapon.

622
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,976
And you lower yours.

623
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,769
Arendellian soldiers?

624
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,063
Threatening my people,
lieutenant?

625
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,481
Invading my dance space, Yelena?

626
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,133
Why does that soldier
look so familiar?

627
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,192
Kristoff: No, no, no.

628
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,444
Lieutenant!

629
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,958
That was magic.

630
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,372
Did you see that?

631
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,086
Of course I saw it.

632
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,456
You chose a nice, cold greeting.

633
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,269
They've been trapped in here
this whole time?

634
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,713
Anna: Yeah. What do we do now?

635
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,922
Olaf: I got this.

636
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,921
Hi, I'm olaf.

637
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,554
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just
find clothes restricting.

638
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,979
Bet you're wondering who
we are and why we're here.

639
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,729
It's really quite simple.

640
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,099
It began with two sisters.

641
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,941
One born with magical powers.

642
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,435
One born powerless.

643
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,358
Their love of snowmen, infinite.

644
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,946
Anna, no! Too high!

645
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,344
Blast!

646
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,904
Mama! Papa! Help!

647
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,073
Slam! Doors shutting everywhere.

648
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,161
Sisters torn apart.

649
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,282
Well, at least
they have their parents.

650
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,204
Their parents are dead.

651
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,118
Oh. Oh, hi. I'm Anna.

652
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,457
I'll marry a man I just met.

653
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,900
Elsa's gonna blow!

654
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,336
Snow! Snow! Aah, run!

655
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,376
Magic pulses
through my snowflakes.

656
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,010
I live.

657
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,721
Ice palace for one.
Ice palace for one.

658
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,715
Get out, Anna. Pew! Pew!

659
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:46,804
My heart.

660
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,888
Oh, my goodness.

661
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,707
Only an act
of true love can save you.

662
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,562
Here's a true love's kiss.

663
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,557
You're not worth it.

664
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,103
Guess what? I'm the bad guy.

665
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,271
What?

666
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,946
And Anna
freezes to death forever.

667
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,652
Oh, Anna.

668
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,658
Then she unfreezes!

669
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,348
Oh, and then Elsa woke up
the magical spirits...

670
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,724
And we were forced
out of our kingdom.

671
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,392
Now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past...

672
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,727
But we don't have a clue
how to do that...

673
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,161
Except Elsa's hearing voices,

674
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,563
s0 we got that going for us.

675
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,043
Any questions?

676
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,540
I think they got it.

677
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,842
Are you really
queen of arendelle?

678
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,051
I am.

679
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,341
Why would nature reward

680
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,222
a person of arendelle
with magic?

681
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,433
Perhaps to make up for
the actions of your people.

682
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,301
My people are innocent.

683
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,349
We would have never
attacked first.

684
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,892
May the truth be found.

685
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,103
- Mm...
- Hi. I'm sorry.

686
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,733
- Uh, what's happening?
- Hmm.

687
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,028
That's it. Lieutenant mattias!

688
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,817
Library, second portrait
on the left.

689
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,191
You were
our father's official guard.

690
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,492
Agnairr.

691
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,452
What did happen to your parents?

692
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,456
Our parents' ship went
down in the Southern sea...

693
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,744
Six years ago.

694
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,548
I see him.
I see him in your faces.

695
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,670
Really?

696
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,880
Soldiers.

697
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,175
We may be getting on in years,
but we're still strong.

698
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,514
And proud to serve arendelle.

699
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,593
Wait. Please.

700
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,686
Someone has called me here.

701
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,851
If I can just find them...

702
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,689
That may help us
free this forest.

703
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,187
Trust me, I just want to help.

704
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,321
We only trust nature.

705
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,574
When nature speaks...

706
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,327
We listen.

707
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,659
This will all
make sense when I'm older.

708
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,575
Man: Fire spirit!

709
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,623
Yelena: Get back, everyone!

710
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,622
Mattias: Head for the river!

711
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,888
No! No! No! The reindeer!
That's a dead end!

712
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,972
Come on, sven!

713
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,937
We'll get them.

714
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,733
Elsal get out of there!

715
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,689
No, no, no.

716
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:08,612
Elsal

717
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,789
Come on, buddy,
we can do this. Hyah!

718
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,677
Anna!

719
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,638
Anna: Ohl

720
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,184
get her out of here.

721
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,555
No! Elsa!

722
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,840
They're all looking at us,
aren't they?

723
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,051
Got any advice?

724
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,354
Nothing?

725
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,474
Hmm. Should I know
what that means?

726
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,895
You hear it, too.

727
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,355
Somebody's calling us.

728
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,283
Who is it? What do we do?

729
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,661
Okay, keep going north.

730
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,460
Elsal

731
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,799
- oh, thank goodness!
- Anna.

732
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,714
- Are you okay?
- What were you doing?

733
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,006
You could've been killed.

734
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,921
You can't just follow me
into fire.

735
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,390
You don't want me
to follow you into fire,

736
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,051
then don't run into fire.

737
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,271
You're not being careful, Elsa.

738
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,813
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

739
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,235
I've been better.

740
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,273
Hmm. I know what you need.

741
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,324
Where did you get that scarf?

742
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,079
That's a northuldra scart.

743
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,244
What?

744
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,875
This 1s from one of
our oldest families.

745
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,999
It was our mother's.

746
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,258
Elsa.

747
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,507
I see it.

748
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,179
It's mother.

749
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,179
Mother saved father's life
that day.

750
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,609
Our mother was northuldra.

751
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,714
We are called northuldra.

752
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,835
We are the people of the sun.

753
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:42,515
I promise you
I will free this forest...

754
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,053
And restore arendelle.

755
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,390
That's a pretty big promise,
Elsa.

756
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,774
Free the forest? Wow.

757
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,313
I'm sorry.

758
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,102
It's just, uh, some of us
were born in here,

759
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,192
we've never even seen
a clear sky.

760
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,440
I get it.

761
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,362
- The name's Ryder.
- Kristoff.

762
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,867
I heard the voice again.

763
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,076
We need to go north.

764
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,993
But the earth giants now roam
the north at night.

765
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,990
You can leave in the morning.

766
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,207
I'm honeymaren.

767
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,623
Honeymaren, we'll do all we can.

768
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,549
Olaf: Hey, let me ask you.

769
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,792
How do you guys cope...

770
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,006
With the ever-increasing
complexity of thought

771
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,217
that comes with maturity?

772
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,723
Brilliant!

773
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,849
On!

774
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,011
It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today.

775
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,512
Our future's in bright hands.

776
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,934
On, no, no. Don't chew that.

777
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,807
You don't know
what I've stepped in.

778
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,684
I can't seem
to get her attention.

779
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,227
Or even say the right thing.

780
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,736
Well, you're in luck.

781
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,856
I know nothing about women.

782
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,072
But I do know that we have

783
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,781
the most amazing
way of proposing.

784
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,865
If we start now,

785
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,266
- we'll be ready by dawn.
- Really?

786
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,325
Best part,

787
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,161
it involves a lot of reindeer.

788
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,791
Kristoff: Whoa.

789
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,289
Mattias: Hey, back at home...

790
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,166
Halima still over
at Hudson's hearth?

791
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,292
She is.

792
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,922
Really? She married?

793
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,131
Mm-mm.

794
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,298
Oh, wow. Why didn't that
make me feel better?

795
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,091
What else do you miss?

796
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,511
My father.

797
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,391
He passed long before all this.

798
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,228
He was a great man.

799
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,893
Built us a good life
in arendelle.

800
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,858
But taught me to never take
the good for granted.

801
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,319
He'd say, "be prepared.

802
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,925
"Just when you think
you've found your way,

803
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,782
"life will throw you
onto a new path."

804
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,110
What do you do when it does?

805
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,736
Don't give up.

806
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,826
Take it one step at atime and...

807
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,742
Just do the next right thing?

808
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,540
Yeah.

809
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,669
You got it.

810
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,047
I wanna show you something.
May 1?

811
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,382
You know air, fire,
water, and earth.

812
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,470
Elsa: Yes.

813
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,430
Honeymaren: But, look,
there's a fifth spirit...

814
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,805
Said to be a bridge between us
and the magic of nature.

815
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,181
A fifth spirit?

816
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,603
Some say

817
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,234
they heard it call out
the day the forest fell.

818
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,069
My father heard it.

819
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,190
Do you think
that is who's calling me?

820
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:07,826
Maybe.
Alas, only ahtohallan knows.

821
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,616
Ahtohallan.

822
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:15,376
Dive down deep into her sound

823
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:20,044
both: But not too far
or you'll be drowned

824
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,174
why do lullabies
always have to have

825
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,756
some terrible warning in them?

826
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,715
I wonder that all the time.

827
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,424
Earth giants.

828
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,847
What are they doing down here?

829
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,390
_shh!

830
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:35,854
Hide.

831
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,032
They're coming!

832
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,918
This is why
we don't play with fire.

833
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:02,545
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Why are you so cute?

834
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,369
Please tell me you were not
about to follow them.

835
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,242
What if I can settle them
like I did the wind and fire?

836
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,953
Or what if they can crush you

837
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,958
before you even get the chance?

838
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,754
Remember, the goal
is to find the voice...

839
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,544
Find the truth, and get us home.

840
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,046
Hey, guys. That was close.

841
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,510
I know.

842
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,888
The giants sensed me.
They may come back here.

843
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,969
I don't want to put anyone
at risk again.

844
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,596
And you're right, Anna.

845
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,560
We've got to find the voice.

846
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:57,804
We're going now.

847
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,225
Okay. We're going.

848
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,643
Let me just...

849
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,649
Wait.
Where are kristoff and sven?

850
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,110
Oh, yeah. I think they
took off with that Ryder guy

851
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,399
and a bunch of reindeer.

852
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,783
- They left?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,240
Just left
without saying anything?

854
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,454
Who knows the ways of men?

855
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,085
Am I supposed to feel
this ridiculous?

856
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,715
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

857
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,633
Everyone ready?

858
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,714
Ready!

859
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,074
Uh, I could use a rehearsal.

860
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,159
I love love.

861
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,969
Wait. You talk for them, too?

862
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,136
I do.

863
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,039
It's like you can actually
hear what they're thinking.

864
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,304
Yeah. And then you just say it.

865
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,101
And then you just say it.

866
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,813
Okay. Here she comes.

867
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,314
Princess Anna of arendelle...

868
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,693
My feisty, fearless,
ginger-sweet love.

869
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,286
Will you marry me?

870
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,535
Um...

871
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,619
No.

872
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,871
The Princess left
with the queen.

873
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,869
What? Wait, what? What?

874
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,123
I wouldn't try to follow.
They're long gone.

875
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,624
Long gone?

876
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,218
So, yeah.

877
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,055
Um, we're heading west
to the lichen meadows.

878
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,762
You can come with us
if you want.

879
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,561
Hey. Um...
I'm really sorry that...

880
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,729
- No, it's fine.
- Yeah. Yep.

881
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,609
Okay, I better
go pack. You coming with?

882
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,398
I'll just...
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

883
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,407
Okay, uh, you know
where you're going, right?

884
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,863
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yep.

885
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,153
I know the woods.

886
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,669
Reindeers are better than people

887
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:58,515
sven, why is love so hard?

888
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,890
You feel what you feel

889
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,809
and those feelings are real

890
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,732
come on, kristoff

891
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:11,104
let down your guard

892
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,789
Again, you're gone

893
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,545
off on a diffrent path than mine

894
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,463
I'm left behind

895
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:37,965
wondering if I should follow

896
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,717
you had to go

897
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,680
and, of course, it's always fine

898
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:51,565
I prob'ly could catch up
with you tomorrow

899
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:58,818
but is this what it feels like
to be growing apart?

900
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,946
When did I become the one

901
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,662
who's always chasing your heart?

902
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,460
Both: Now I turn around and find

903
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,831
I am lost in the woods

904
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,251
north is south right is left

905
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,550
when you're gone

906
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,344
I'm the one who sees you home

907
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:25,140
but now I'm lost in the woods

908
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:30,142
and I don't know
what path you are on

909
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,644
I'm lost in the woods

910
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,033
up tll now

911
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,996
the next step
was a question of how

912
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:49,794
I never thought it was
a question of whether

913
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,337
who am I

914
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:57,050
if I'm not your guy?

915
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:02,264
Where am I
if we're not together?

916
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,805
Forever

917
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,680
now I know you're my true north

918
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:12,224
'cause I am lost in the woods

919
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,068
up is down day is night

920
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:18,606
when you're not there

921
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,484
oh, you're my only landmark

922
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,242
so I'm lost in the woods

923
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:30,125
wondering if you still care

924
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,708
but I'll wait

925
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,791
for a sign

926
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:40,587
- for a sign
- That I'm your path

927
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:44,341
- "cause you are mine
- You are mine

928
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,304
until then

929
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:50,350
- I'm lost in the woods
- Lost in the woods

930
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,890
in the woods lost in the woods

931
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,558
I'm lost in the woods

932
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:58,734
lost in the woods I'm lost

933
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:04,452
I'm lost in the woods

934
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,603
Hey, olaf, um, maybe just
one of you should do it?

935
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,768
I agree. She's a little pitchy.

936
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,774
Hey, Gale's back.

937
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,614
What?

938
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,284
How can it be?

939
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,501
What is it?

940
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,585
Anna: Mother and father's ship.

941
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,299
But this isn't the Southern sea.

942
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,669
No, it isn't.

943
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,308
Elsa: Why is their ship here?

944
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,066
How is it here?

945
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,028
It must have been washed in
from the dark sea.

946
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,401
What were they doing
in the dark sea?

947
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,696
I don't know.

948
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,699
How did the ship
get through the mist?

949
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,701
I thought nobody could but us.

950
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:39,209
Unless nobody was on it.

951
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,382
There's gotta be something here.

952
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,547
Wait. Wait. Look around.

953
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,796
Every arendellian ship
has a compartment.

954
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,090
Waterproof.

955
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,599
That's very clever.

956
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,139
Although, it does make me wonder

957
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,188
why they don't just make
the whole ship waterproof.

958
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,861
Here.

959
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,903
What language is this?

960
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,449
I don't know.

961
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,911
But look,
this is mother's handwriting.

962
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,533
"The end of the ice age.

963
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,706
"The river found, but lost.

964
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,502
"Magic's source. Elsa's source?"

965
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,634
It's a map.

966
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,305
They traveled north

967
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,093
and planned to cross
the dark sea to...

968
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,094
Elsa: Ahtohallan.

969
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,721
It's real?

970
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,018
Octa-who-what?

971
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,436
Ahtohallan.

972
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,434
It's a magical river

973
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,979
said to hold all the answers
about the past.

974
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,357
Reinforcing my
"water has memory" theory. Mm.

975
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,488
Water has memory.

976
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,663
Elsa?

977
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,745
I wanna know
what happened to them.

978
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,680
Iduna: Ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic.

979
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,431
Agnarr: We keep going for Elsa.

980
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,766
Iduna: The waves are too high!

981
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,931
Agnarr: Iduna! Iduna: Agnarr!

982
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,890
Elsal

983
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,074
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

984
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,944
This is my fault.

985
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,447
They were looking for answers
about me.

986
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,620
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa.

987
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,789
No. Just their deaths.

988
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,870
Stop. No.

989
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,623
Yelena asked,
why would the spirits

990
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,168
reward arendelle
with a magical queen?

991
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,512
Because our mother
saved our father.

992
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,802
She saved her enemy.

993
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:58,928
Her good deed
was rewarded with you.

994
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,554
You are a gift.

995
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,771
For what?

996
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,266
If anyone can resolve
the past...

997
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,520
If anyone can save arendelle
and free this forest,

998
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:08,858
it's you.

999
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:13,405
I believe in you, Elsa.
More than anyone or anything.

1000
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,951
Honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit.

1001
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,125
A bridge between
the magic of nature and us.

1002
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,589
A fifth spirit?

1003
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,717
That's who's been calling me
from ahtohallan.

1004
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,758
The answers about the past
are all there.

1005
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,881
So we go to ahtohallan.

1006
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,470
Not "we."

1007
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,761
Me. Anna: What?

1008
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,105
The dark sea
is too dangerous for us both.

1009
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,940
No. No! We do this together.

1010
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,479
Remember the song?

1011
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,611
"Go too far
and you'll be drowned."

1012
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,942
Who will stop you
from going too far?

1013
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,232
You said you believed in me,

1014
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,821
that this is
what I was born to do.

1015
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,990
And I don't wanna stop you
from that.

1016
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,122
I... I don't wanna stop you

1017
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,953
from being
whatever you need to be.

1018
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,618
I just don't want you dying...

1019
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:08,714
Trying to be everything
for everyone else, too.

1020
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,127
Don't do this alone.

1021
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,418
Let me help you, please.

1022
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,841
I can't lose you, Elsa.

1023
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,433
I can't lose you either, Anna.

1024
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,721
- Come on.
- Olaf: Mmm.

1025
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,557
Wait, what?

1026
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,229
What are you doing?

1027
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,393
Elsal

1028
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,689
no! No!

1029
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,399
Olaf, help me stop.

1030
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,991
Give me a hand.

1031
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,993
- Hang on!
- Olaf: Whoa!

1032
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,578
Anna: Wait. Wait! No! No! No!

1033
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,492
Oh, come on!

1034
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,711
Olaf: Anna,
this might sound crazy...

1035
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,205
But I'm sensing
some rising anger.

1036
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,795
Well, I am angry, olaf!

1037
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,506
She promised me
we'd do this together!

1038
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,590
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1039
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,929
But what I mean is, I'm
sensing rising anger in me.

1040
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,767
Wait, you're angry?

1041
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,141
Um, I... I think so.

1042
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:09,357
Elsa pushed me away, too,
and didn't even say goodbye.

1043
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:13,312
And you have every right
to be very, very mad at her.

1044
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,814
And you said
some things never change.

1045
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,361
But since then,

1046
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,403
everything's done nothing
but change.

1047
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,029
I know.

1048
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:26,082
But look, I'm still here
holding your hand.

1049
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,161
Yeah, that's a good point, Anna.

1050
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,288
I feel better.
You're such a good listener.

1051
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,212
Don't shush me. That's rude.

1052
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,468
No! No!

1053
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:48,305
Oh. The giants.

1054
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,478
They're huge.

1055
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,158
- Hang on, olaf.
- Huh?

1056
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,165
Try not to scream.

1057
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,725
Found it.

1058
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,641
Thank you.

1059
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,480
Where are we?

1060
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:37,487
In a pit with no way out.

1061
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:41,074
But with a spooky,
pitch-black way in.

1062
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,873
Come on, it'll be fun.

1063
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,742
Assuming we don't
get stuck here forever,

1064
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:51,831
no one ever finds us...

1065
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,370
And you starve and I give up.

1066
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,631
But, bright side,
Elsa's gotta be doing

1067
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,213
a whole lot better than we are.

1068
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,838
Okay.

1069
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,718
Oh.

1070
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,649
Whoa!

1071
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,428
No!

1072
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,151
Whoa

1073
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,222
No!

1074
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,751
Of course.

1075
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:46,126
Glaciers are rivers of ice.

1076
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,880
Ahtohallan is frozen.

1077
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,599
I hear you.

1078
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,187
And I'm coming.

1079
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,898
Every inch of me is trembling

1080
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:12,573
but not from the cold

1081
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,822
something is familiar

1082
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:20,623
like a dream
I can reach but not quite hold

1083
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,829
I can sense you there

1084
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:28,218
like a friend I've always known

1085
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:32,051
I'm arriving

1086
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:36,392
and it feels like I am home

1087
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:40,809
I have always been a fortress

1088
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,776
cold secrets deep inside

1089
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,901
you have secrets, too

1090
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,113
but you don't have to hide

1091
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,828
show yourself

1092
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,869
I'm dying to meet you

1093
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,372
show yourself

1094
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,671
it's your turn

1095
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:11,963
are you the one I've been
looking for all of my life?

1096
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,220
Show yourself

1097
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:19,720
I'm ready to learn

1098
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,770
['Ve never felt so certain

1099
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:33,863
all my life I've been torn

1100
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:37,238
but I'm here for a reason

1101
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:41,834
could it be the reason
I was born?

1102
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,579
I have always been so different

1103
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,548
normal rules did not apply

1104
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:53,386
is this the day? Are you the way

1105
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:57,633
[ finally find out why?

1106
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,885
Show yourself!

1107
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:03,434
I'm no longer trembling

1108
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,773
here I am

1109
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,019
['ve come so far

1110
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,151
you are the answer
I've waited for

1111
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:16,026
all of my life

1112
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,245
oh, show yourself!

1113
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:23,617
Let me see who you are

1114
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:28,088
come to me now

1115
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:31,212
open your door

1116
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:36,138
don't make me wait

1117
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:39,133
one moment more

1118
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:43,770
oh, come to me now

1119
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:47,607
open your door

1120
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,644
don't make me wait

1121
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:57,614
one moment more

1122
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:06,080
chorus: Where the northwind

1123
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,830
meets the sea -

1124
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:13,421
there's a river -

1125
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:14,668
full of memory

1126
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,089
mother.

1127
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:21,926
Come, my darling, homeward bound

1128
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,266
I am found!

1129
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,816
Elsa and iduna: Show yourself

1130
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,061
step into your power

1131
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,780
grow yourself

1132
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:39,026
into something new

1133
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,029
iduna: You are the one
you've been waiting for

1134
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,623
- all of my life
- Iduna: All of your life

1135
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,545
oh, show yourself!

1136
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,403
Young Elsa: Hi, I'm olaf.
And I like warm hugs.

1137
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,649
Young Anna: I love you, olaf!

1138
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,651
Iduna: Come on, you can do it.

1139
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,321
Here I stand - oh.

1140
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,454
In the light of day

1141
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,081
Duke of weselton:
Oh! Like a chicken

1142
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,616
with the face of a monkey!

1143
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,470
Anna: I just wasn't looking
where I was going.

1144
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,086
But I'm great actually.

1145
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,456
Hans: Prince hans
of the Southern isles.

1146
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:36,587
Agnarr: I love you.

1147
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,300
I need to tell you
about my past.

1148
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:39,381
And where I'm from.

1149
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,670
I'm listening.

1150
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,923
Ldunal

1151
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,557
what are you reading,
your majesty?

1152
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,842
Oh, some new Danish author.

1153
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,026
Soldier: King runeard,
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1154
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,107
Grandfather?

1155
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,364
We bring arendelle's full guard.

1156
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,655
But they have given us
no reason not to trust them.

1157
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,032
The northuldra follow magic.

1158
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,867
Which means
we can never trust them.

1159
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,035
Grandfather?

1160
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,292
Magic makes people feel
too powerful. Too entitled.

1161
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:15,585
It makes them think they can
defy the will of a king.

1162
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,548
That is not what magic does.

1163
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:19,042
That's just your fear.

1164
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,511
Fear is what can't be trusted.

1165
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,096
You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,

1166
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,730
so they will have to turn to me.

1167
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:39,062
Iduna:
Dive down deep into her sound

1168
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,862
but not too far,
or you'll be drowned

1169
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,111
runeard: They will come
in celebration.

1170
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:49,705
And then, we will know
their size and strength.

1171
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,460
As you have welcomed us,
we welcome you...

1172
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,163
Our neighbors, our friends.

1173
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,892
King runeard, the dam isn't
strengthening our waters.

1174
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,565
It's hurting the forest.

1175
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,062
It's cutting off the north...

1176
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,860
Let... let's not
discuss this here.

1177
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,950
Let's meet on the fjord.
Have tea.

1178
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,740
Find a solution.

1179
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,252
No!

1180
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:47,801
Anna!

1181
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:01,649
Olaf: Hmm. Which lucky tunnel
do we choose?

1182
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:04,238
Runeard: You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,

1183
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,693
so they will have fo turn to me.

1184
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,262
Northuldra leader:
King runeard, the dam,

1185
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,117
it's hurting the forest.

1186
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,582
Elsa's found it.

1187
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,077
What is it?

1188
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,999
The truth about the past.

1189
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,256
That's my grandfather...

1190
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,252
Attacking
the northuldra leader...

1191
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,342
Who wields no weapon.

1192
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,559
The dam wasn't a gift of peace.

1193
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,266
It was a trick.

1194
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,056
But that goes against everything

1195
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,474
arendelle stands for.

1196
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,563
It does, doesn't it?

1197
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,731
I know how to free the forest.

1198
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:50,492
I know what we have to do
to set things right.

1199
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,371
Why do you say that so sadly?

1200
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,956
We have to break the dam.

1201
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,791
But arendelle will be flooded.

1202
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,497
That's why everyone
was forced out.

1203
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:04,590
To protect them
from what has to be done.

1204
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,758
Oh. Ohl

1205
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,472
are you okay?

1206
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,842
I could really use
a bright side, olaf.

1207
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,181
Bright side? Um...

1208
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,972
Turtles can breathe
through their butts.

1209
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,733
- Huh?
- And I see a way out.

1210
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,187
I knew I could count on you.

1211
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:34,161
Come on, olaf, Elsa's probably
on her way back right now.

1212
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,530
We can meet her and...

1213
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,745
Olaf?

1214
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:40,869
What's this?

1215
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:42,579
Are you okay?

1216
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,585
I'm flurrying?

1217
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:45,999
Wait. No. That's...

1218
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,713
That's not it.

1219
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:52,384
I'm flurrying away.

1220
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,134
The magic in me is fading.

1221
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,222
What?

1222
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,354
I don't think Elsa's okay.

1223
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,767
1 think.

1224
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,028
She may have gone too far.

1225
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,573
No. No.

1226
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:11,816
Olaf: Anna?

1227
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,364
I'm sorry.

1228
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,614
You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own.

1229
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,240
Okay? Wait.

1230
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,708
Come here.

1231
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,252
- I've got you.
- Oh.

1232
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,166
That's good.

1233
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,465
Hey, Anna?

1234
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,886
I just thought of one thing
that's permanent.

1235
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,220
What's that?

1236
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,514
Love.

1237
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,009
Warm hugs?

1238
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,644
I like warm hugs.

1239
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,322
I love you.

1240
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,974
Olaf? Elsa?

1241
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,849
What do I do now?

1242
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,313
I've seen dark before

1243
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,156
but not like this

1244
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:22,030
this is cold, this is empty
this is numb

1245
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,867
the life I knew is over

1246
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,584
the lights are out

1247
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,086
hello, darkness

1248
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,548
I'm ready to succumb

1249
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,553
I follow you around

1250
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,798
I always have

1251
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:44,143
but you've gone fo a place
I cannot find

1252
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:49,266
this grief has a gravity

1253
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,734
it pulls me down

1254
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:58,073
but a tiny voice

1255
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,452
whispers in my mind

1256
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,077
you are lost

1257
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:08,542
hope is gone

1258
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:13,043
but you must go on

1259
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,879
and do the next right thing

1260
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:30,560
Can there be a day
beyond this night?

1261
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:35,273
I don't know anymore
what is true

1262
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:40,696
I can't find my direction
I'm all alone

1263
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:46,823
the only star that guided me
was you

1264
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:51,707
how to rise from the floor

1265
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:56,333
when it's not you
I'm rising for?

1266
01:15:56,802 --> 01:16:00,294
Just do the next right thing

1267
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,130
take a step

1268
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,140
step again

1269
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:10,688
it is all that I can

1270
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:16,152
to do the next right thing

1271
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,027
I won't look too far ahead

1272
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:25,657
it's too much for me (o take

1273
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:29,331
but break it down
to this next breath

1274
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,910
this next step

1275
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:36,210
this next choice
is one that I can make!

1276
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:42,879
So I'll walk through this night

1277
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:47,554
stumbling blindly
toward the light

1278
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:52,263
and do the next right thing

1279
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,725
and with the dawn

1280
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,852
what comes then?

1281
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,695
When it's clear that everything

1282
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:04,780
will never be the same again?

1283
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:09,575
Then I'll make the choice

1284
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,208
to hear that voice

1285
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:16,704
and do

1286
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:21,300
the next right thing

1287
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,606
Wake up!

1288
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,278
Wake up!

1289
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,845
That's it.

1290
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,010
Come and get me! Come on!

1291
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,438
Over here!

1292
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,189
That's right. Keep coming.

1293
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:22,944
Keep coming!

1294
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,657
That'll work.

1295
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,450
This way, guys!

1296
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,254
What?

1297
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,587
No, no, no, no.
She's leading them to the dam.

1298
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,018
Kristoff!

1299
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,641
I'm here. What do you need?

1300
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,143
- To get to the dam.
- You got it.

1301
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:03,231
Thank you.

1302
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,120
Kristoff: Come on. Come on.

1303
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,977
- Anna: Help me up!
- We'll meet you around!

1304
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:28,669
Lieutenant mattias.

1305
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,138
Your highness,
what are you doing?

1306
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,632
The dam must fall.

1307
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,384
It's the only way to break
the mist and free the forest.

1308
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,103
But we've sworn to protect
arendelle at all costs.

1309
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:41,440
Arendelle has no future
until we make this right.

1310
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,524
King runeard betrayed everyone.

1311
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,320
How do you know that?

1312
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,814
My sister gave her life
for the truth.

1313
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,784
Please.

1314
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,744
Before we lose anyone else.

1315
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,097
Look out!

1316
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,562
Destroy the dam! Come on!

1317
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:29,154
Throw your boulders.

1318
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:35,528
That's it.

1319
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,592
- I've got her!
- Annal

1320
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:56,510
mattias: Hang on!

1321
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,198
I'm sorry I left you behind.

1322
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:21,326
I was just so desperate
to protect her.

1323
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:24,071
I know. I know. It's okay.

1324
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,240
My love is not fragile.

1325
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:29,201
Wow.

1326
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:32,129
Look at the sky.

1327
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,337
I just didn't realize
there was so much of it.

1328
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:38,673
34 years...

1329
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,136
Five months...

1330
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,927
And 23 days.

1331
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,586
Is it really you?

1332
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,422
Anna.

1333
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,426
I thought I'd lost you.

1334
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:02,920
Lost me?

1335
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,638
You saved me. Again.

1336
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:06,802
I did?

1337
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:09,722
And, Anna,
arendelle did not fall.

1338
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,138
It didn't?

1339
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,482
The spirits all agreed.

1340
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:18,148
Arendelle deserves
to stand with you.

1341
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:20,983
Me?

1342
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:24,074
You did what was right.
For everyone.

1343
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:26,067
Did you find the fifth spirit?

1344
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:30,788
You are the fifth spirit.

1345
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:32,541
You're the bridge.

1346
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,376
Well, actually,
a bridge has two sides.

1347
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:38,167
And mother had two daughters.

1348
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,545
We did this together.

1349
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:45,466
Together.

1350
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:47,635
Elsa! You're okay!

1351
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:52,849
You look different.

1352
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,208
Did you cut your hair
or something?

1353
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,814
- Or something.
- Oh.

1354
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:03,818
Anna, I need to ask you
a question.

1355
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,531
Okay.

1356
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,905
Do you want to build a showman?

1357
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:09,661
What?

1358
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:25,802
Thank goodness water has memory.

1359
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:38,811
Anna.

1360
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,606
_elsa!

1361
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:43,816
Kristoff! And sven!

1362
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,983
You all came back.

1363
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:49,993
Oh, I love happy endings.

1364
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:51,824
I mean, I presume we're done.

1365
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:54,494
Or is this "putting us
in mortal danger" situation

1366
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:56,124
gonna be a regular thing?

1367
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:57,909
No. We're done.

1368
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,004
Actually,
there is one more thing.

1369
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:02,626
Anna,

1370
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:05,918
you are the most extraordinary
person I've ever known.

1371
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,888
I love you with all I am.

1372
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:11,301
Will you marry me?

1373
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,179
Oh.

1374
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,014
Yes! Ah.

1375
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,687
_kristofe: Aw.

1376
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:41,498
Arendelle's okay.

1377
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:42,996
What?

1378
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:45,624
Ahtohallan is beautiful.

1379
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,042
_oh!

1380
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,335
Hello.

1381
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:52,259
You know, you belong up here.

1382
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:56,096
I took an oath to always do
what's best for arendelle.

1383
01:27:57,147 --> 01:28:00,765
Luckily,
I know just what that is.

1384
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:03,517
While I still don't know
what "transformation" means...

1385
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:07,862
I feel like this forest
has really changed us all.

1386
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:18,207
Presenting her majesty,
queen Anna of arendelle!

1387
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,958
Oh! Hello. Hi.

1388
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:29,717
Sven, don't you look nice.

1389
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:32,922
Oh, my goodness! Olaf!

1390
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:35,014
Charmed, I'm sure.

1391
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,971
Charming.

1392
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,385
Your majesty.

1393
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,021
Anna: Kristoff.

1394
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,690
Aw, did you boys
get all dressed up for me?

1395
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,442
It was sven's idea.

1396
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:49,821
One hour. You get this
for one hour.

1397
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,065
That's okay.

1398
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:53,658
I prefer you in leather anyway.

1399
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:59,698
I'm shocked you can last
an hour. That was brutal.

1400
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,584
The things we do for love.

1401
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,744
What is this crazy magic
called again?

1402
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,246
A photograph.

1403
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:07,714
Photograph. Huh.

1404
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:09,529
We look good.

1405
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,509
Halima. General mattias.

1406
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,629
Uh, your majesty.
I'll be right back.

1407
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:16,302
You can look at our photograph
while I'm gone.

1408
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,307
I'm just kidding.

1409
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:20,427
- How am I doing?
Anna: Fantastic.

1410
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:33,399
Our lands and people,
now connected by love.

1411
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,328
Hi, Gale. You like it?

1412
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:45,744
Oh, do you mind? I've got
a message for my sister.

1413
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,102
Thank you.

1414
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:11,736
"Charades Friday night.
Don't be late.

1415
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:14,277
"And don't worry,
arendelle's doing just fine.

1416
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,274
"Keep looking after the forest.

1417
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:17,867
"I love you."

1418
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,195
I love you, too, sis.

1419
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,786
Hey, Gale? We're going
for a ride, wanna come?

1420
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:29,420
You ready?

1421
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,381
Ah ah oh oh oh

1422
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:25,014
ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh

1423
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:28,931
into the unknown

1424
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,852
into the unknown

1425
01:31:33,113 --> 01:31:38,528
into the unknown

1426
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,118
ah ah oh oh oh

1427
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:45,030
I can hear you but I won't

1428
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:49,288
some look for trouble
while others don't

1429
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:54,209
there's a thousand reasons
I should go about my day

1430
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:58,673
and ignore your whispers
which I wish would go away

1431
01:31:58,722 --> 01:31:59,928
oh oh oh

1432
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,635
whoa oh

1433
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:08,057
you're not a voice

1434
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,521
you're just a ringing in my ear

1435
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:12,808
and if I heard you which I don't

1436
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,102
I'm spoken for I fear

1437
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,193
everyone I've ever loved
is here within these walls

1438
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:20,986
I'm sorry, secret siren

1439
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,277
but I'm blocking out your calls

1440
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,202
I've had my adventure

1441
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:27,071
I don't need something new

1442
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:30,659
I'm afraid of what I'm risking
if I follow you...

1443
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:34,580
Into the unknown

1444
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:38,755
into the unknown

1445
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:44,298
into the unknown

1446
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,764
ah ah oh oh oh

1447
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:51,392
ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh

1448
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:53,022
what do you want?

1449
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,900
'Cause you've been
keeping me awake

1450
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:59,775
are you here to distract me
so I make a big mistake?

1451
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:04,200
Or are you someone out there
who's a little bit like me?

1452
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:08,242
Who knows deep down
I'm not where I'm meant to be?

1453
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:10,330
Every day's a little harder

1454
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:12,537
as I feel your power grow

1455
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:14,665
don't you know
there's a part of me

1456
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:17,456
that longs to go...

1457
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,881
Into the unknown

1458
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:25,926
into the unknown

1459
01:33:26,059 --> 01:33:29,677
into the unknown

1460
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:31,970
ah ah oh oh oh ah ah oh oh oh

1461
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,098
whoa oh oh

1462
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,016
are you out there?
Do you know me?

1463
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:39,231
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?

1464
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:43,072
Ah ah oh oh

1465
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:45,200
ah ah oh oh

1466
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:48,203
ah ah oh oh - ah ah oh oh

1467
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,079
ah ah oh oh

1468
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:52,115
ah ah oh oh

1469
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,121
ah ah oh oh

1470
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:56,999
ah ah oh oh

1471
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:01,791
where are you going?
Don't leave me alone

1472
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:06,638
how do I follow you

1473
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:10,516
into the unknown

1474
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,147
Whoo!

1475
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:38,332
Where the northwind

1476
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:41,544
meelis the sea

1477
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,459
there's a river

1478
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:48,096
full of memory

1479
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:52,267
sleep, my darling safe and sound

1480
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:56,972
for in this river, all is found

1481
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:01,355
all is found

1482
01:35:02,572 --> 01:35:07,032
when all is lost
then all is found

1483
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,152
in her waters

1484
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:13,496
deep and true

1485
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:19,123
lie the answers
and a path for you

1486
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:24,420
dive down deep into her sound

1487
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:28,963
but not too far
or you'll be drowned

1488
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:35,302
she will sing to those who hear

1489
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:42,439
and in her song all magic flows

1490
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:47,610
but can you brave
what you most fear?

1491
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:54,663
Can you face
what the river knows?

1492
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:22,224
Until the river's
finally crossed

1493
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:28,814
you'll never feel
the solid ground

1494
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:34,870
you have to get a little lost

1495
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:37,580
on your way

1496
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:41,372
to being found

1497
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:47,507
where the northwind

1498
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:50,510
meelis the sea

1499
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,387
there's a mother

1500
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:56,766
full of memory

1501
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:01,263
come, my darling, homeward bound

1502
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:05,107
where all is lost

1503
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:08,895
then all is found

1504
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,608
all is found

1505
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:16,319
all is found

1506
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,511
Again you're gone

1507
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:42,012
off on a diffrent path than mine

1508
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:43,680
I'm left behind

1509
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:47,942
wondering if I should follow

1510
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,485
you had to go

1511
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:55,863
and, of course, it's always fine

1512
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:01,365
I prob'ly could catch up
with you tomorrow

1513
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:09,005
but is this what it feels like
to be growing apart?

1514
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,416
When did I become the one

1515
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:15,508
who's always chasing your heart?

1516
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:18,507
Now I turn around and find

1517
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:21,718
I am lost in the woods

1518
01:38:21,771 --> 01:38:24,808
north is south right is left

1519
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:28,190
when you're gone

1520
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:31,069
I'm the one who sees you home

1521
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:35,073
but now I'm lost in the woods

1522
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:40,238
and I don't know
what path you are on

1523
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,905
I'm lost in the woods

1524
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,203
up tll now

1525
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:53,716
the next step
was a question of how

1526
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:59,347
I never thought it was
a question of whether

1527
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:02,225
who am I

1528
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,478
if I'm not your guy?

1529
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:11,943
Where am I
if we're not together?

1530
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:15,321
Forever

1531
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:18,282
now I know you're my true north

1532
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:21,785
'cause I am lost in the woods

1533
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:24,740
up is down day is night

1534
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,205
when you're not there

1535
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,538
oh, you're my only landmark

1536
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:34,958
so I'm lost in the woods

1537
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:39,842
wondering if you still care

1538
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:43,049
but I'll wait

1539
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,352
for a sign

1540
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:50,356
- for a sign
- That I'm your path

1541
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:54,064
- "cause you are mine
- You are mine

1542
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:55,819
until then

1543
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:59,991
- I'm lost in the woods
- Lost in the woods

1544
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:02,778
in the woods lost in the woods

1545
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,536
I'm lost in the woods

1546
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:08,575
lost in the woods I'm lost

1547
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:13,668
I'm lost in the woods

1548
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:06,734
Show yourself right now!

1549
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:08,361
Elsa, be who you are.

1550
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:10,237
Oh, I will. Mama, 1 will.

1551
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:11,476
Elsa's dead.

1552
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,740
Olaf's dead.

1553
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:14,625
Anna cries.

1554
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:16,773
And then a bunch of important
things happen that I forgot.

1555
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:17,858
But all that matters is,
I was right.

1556
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:19,668
And water has memory,
and thus...

1557
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:21,673
I live!

1558
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,171
And so do you.

1559
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,053
Whoa!

1560
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:27,759
We live!

1561
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:30,554
We live! Oh!

1562
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:33,140
Good story.

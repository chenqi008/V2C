1
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,476
Boy: All right, everyone!
This... is a stick-up!

2
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,182
Don't anybody move!

3
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,314
Now, empty that safe!

4
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,485
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Money, money, money!

5
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,863
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

6
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,987
Quiet, Bo peep,
or your sheep get run over!

7
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,152
Help! Baa! Help us!

8
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,785
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

9
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,256
Voice box: Reach for the sky!

10
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,504
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

11
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,338
I'm here to stop you,
one-eyed Bart.

12
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,843
Doh! How'd you know it was me?

13
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,632
Are you gonna come quietly?

14
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:43,892
You can't touch me, sheriff!

15
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,263
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field.

16
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,191
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

17
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,727
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!

18
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,528
You're going to jail, Bart!

19
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,698
Say goodbye to the wife
and tater tots.

20
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,368
You saved the day again, Woody.

21
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,003
Voice box: You're my
favorite deputy.

22
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,540

00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,484
- Mom: What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, mom!

50
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,909
Okay, birthday boy...

51
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,991
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

52
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,893
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...

53
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,828
- One, two... four.
- Oh, my gosh, you got...

54
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,690
- Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
- Could we leave this up 'til we move?

55
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,625
Well, sure! We can leave it up.
Yeah!

56
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,819
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.

57
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,676
Okay. It's party time, Woody.

58
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,338
Yee-haw!

59
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,769
Howdy, little lady.

60
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,810
Voice box: Somebody's
poisoned the water hole.

61
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,819
Come on, Molly.

62
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:00,980
Oh, you're getting heavy.

63
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,823
See you later, Woody.

64
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,368
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?

65
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,335
Okay, everybody, coast is clear!

66
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,549
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

67
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,556
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess drool.

68
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,690
Hey, hamm.

69
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,949
- Look, I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.

70
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,537
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

71
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,751
- Hey, sarge, have you seen slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

72
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,754
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

73
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,461
Hey, uh, slinky?

74
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,389
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

75
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,683
- No. S-slink...
- Oh, well, all right.

76
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,934
You can be red if you want.

77
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,012
Not now, slink. I got some bad news.

78
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,100
Bad news?

79
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,056
Shh, shh, shh!

80
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,463
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.

81
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,487
Got it.

82
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,687
- Be happy!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

83
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,527
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, robot, podium duty.

84
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,868
Hey.

85
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,576
Hey, etch. Draw!

86
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,750
Oh! Got me again.

87
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,547
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the west.

88
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,583
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

89
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,343
Now, where is that... oh.

90
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,921
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

91
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,602
- How're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

92
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,554
I was close to being scared
that time.

93
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,191
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

94
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,610
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

95
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,273
Ow! Oh. Hi, Bo. Hi.

96
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,949
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

97
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,778
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothing.

98
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:17,116
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

99
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,293
Oh, yeah!

100
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,836
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

101
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,088
Smaller toys up front.

102
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,963
Slinky: Hey, Woody, come on.

103
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,851
Ahem!

104
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,475
Oh, thanks, Mike.

105
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,648
Okay... whoa, whoa. Step back.

106
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,230
- Hamm: For crying out loud.
- Thank you.

107
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,651
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

108
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,779
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

109
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,945
Okay. First item today...

110
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,331
Uh... oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

111
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,992
- Rex: What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

112
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,328
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

113
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,747
Do we have to hold hands?

114
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,128
You guys think this is a big joke.

115
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,590
We've only got one week
left before the move.

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,672
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

117
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,349
If you don't have one, get one!

118
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,352
All right, next. Uh, oh, yes.

119
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,727
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting

120
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,183
was, I think, a big success.

121
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,486
And we wanna thank Mr. spell
for putting that on for us.

122
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,531
Thank you, Mr. spell.

123
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,936
Electronic voice: You're welcome.

124
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,700
Okay. Uh, oh, yes.
One, uh, minor note here.

125
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,408
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

126
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,160
Wait a minute here!

127
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,372
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!

128
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,124
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

129
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,958
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.

130
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,758
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.

131
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,508
Of course Woody ain't worried. He's
been Andy's favorite since kindergarten.

132
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,889
Hey, hey. Come on, potato head.

133
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,519
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

134
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,849
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

135
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,562
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

136
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,645
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

137
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,697
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

138
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,108
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

139
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,070
This is Andy
we're talking about.

140
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,247
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

141
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,584
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

142
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,665
That's what we're made for, right?

143
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,502
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

144
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,382
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

145
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,593
Stay calm, everyone!

146
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,098
Hey!

147
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,206
Uh, meeting adjourned.

148
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,642
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

149
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,102
I can't see a thing.

150
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,397
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

151
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,317
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.

152
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,494
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- Rex: They're getting bigger.

153
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,913
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

154
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,993
Child: Hil

155
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,161
Mr. spell: Spell, trash can.
Rex: We're doomed!

156
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,996
All right! All right!

157
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,800
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

158
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,713
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

159
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,798
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

160
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:26,351
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code red!

161
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,898
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

162
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,810
All right, men.
You heard him. Code red!

163
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,318
Repeat, we are at code red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

164
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,490
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

165
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,465
Children: Yeah!

166
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,840
Mom: Okay, come on, kids.

167
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,851
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

168
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,919
And this is how we find out

169
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,213
what is in those presents.

170
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,883
Mom: Okay, who's hungry?

171
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,009
Here come the chips!

172
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,926
I've got cool ranch
and barbecue! Ow!

173
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,806
What in the world... ohl

174
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,064
I thought I told him to pick these up.

175
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,774
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

176
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,945
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

177
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,981
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

178
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,165
G-g-go on without me! J-just go!

179
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,089
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

180
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,778
Mom: Okay, everybody, come on.

181
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,937
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...

182
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,903
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

183
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,820
Good. And... which present
are you gonna open first?

184
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,118
Child: Mine!
Sergeant: There they are.

185
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,063
Soldier on monitor: Come in,
mother bird. This is Alpha bravo.

186
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,567
- This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
- Come in, mother bird.

187
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,426
Mrs. potato head! Mrs. potato head!
Mrs. potato head!

188
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,003
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

189
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,555
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

190
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,180
Its a... it's...
It's a... a lunch box.

191
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,477
- We've got a lunch box here.
- A lunch box?

192
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,308
- Lunch box?
- For lunch.

193
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,936
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...

194
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,852
Okay, it's bed sheets.
“Who invited that kid?

195
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,200
Oh! Only one left.

196
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,033
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!

197
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,489
It's a big one. It's a...

198
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,075
It's a board game! Repeat, battleship!
“Whew!

199
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,411
Hamm: Hallelujah!

200
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,371
- Yeah! All right!
- Hey, watch it!

201
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,172
Sorry there, old spud head.

202
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,048
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

203
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,470
So did I tell ya? Huh?
Nothin' to worry about.

204
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,974
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

205
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,351
Wait a minute. Ohl!

206
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,522
- What do we have here?
- Wait! Turn that thing back on!

207
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,395
Come in, mother bird!
Come in, mother bird!

208
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,193
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

209
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,651
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

210
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,928
- Mom, what is it?
- Sergeant: It's a huge package.

211
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,694
Oh, get outta the... one of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

212
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,738
It's a... kids together: Wow!

213
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:16,285
It's a what? What is it?

214
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,190
Oh, no!

215
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,214
Oh, ya big lizard!

216
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,881
- Now we'll never know what it is!
- Way to go, Rex!

217
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,924
No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

218
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,573
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!

219
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,510
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

220
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,343
Andy:: Let's go to my room, guys!

221
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,138
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

222
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,268
- There!
Soldier: Juvenile intrusion!

223
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,145
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

224
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,898
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

225
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,707
Hamm: Get to your places!
Get to your places!

226
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,469
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

227
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,826
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

228
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,466
Andy: Hey, look,
its lasers light up. Take that, zurg!

229
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,840
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

230
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,159
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

231
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,095
Mom: Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

232
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,222
We've got prizes!

233
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,594
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

234
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,281
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?

235
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,535
Slinky: Woody?

236
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,742
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Uh, nothin'. Uh, nothin...

237
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,457
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

238
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,293
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

239
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,127
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

240
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,421
- Have you been replaced?
- What did I tell you earlier?

241
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,339
No one is getting replaced.

242
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,143
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there

243
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,931
a nice, big Andy's-room welcome.

244
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,665
Buzz lightyear to star command.

245
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,674
Come in, star command.

246
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,490
Star command, come in.

247
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,594
Do you read me?

248
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,970
Why don't they answer? My ship!

249
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,017
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.

250
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,691
Buzz lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

251
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,066
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

252
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,614
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

253
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,192
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

254
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,079
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

255
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,249
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

256
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,373
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

257
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,796
Hello!

258
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,841
Whoa! H-hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

259
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,218
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

260
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,720
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

261
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,675
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

262
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,470
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

263
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,771
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

264
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,349
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

265
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,360
I'm buzz lightyear, space ranger,
universe protection unit.

266
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,646
My ship has crash-landed here
by mistake.

267
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,575
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

268
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,235
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

269
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,413
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

270
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,915
Well, let's see. We got double-a's.

271
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,913
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

272
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,374
Don't shoot! It's okay. Friends.

273
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,211
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.

274
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,626
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

275
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,337
I am buzz lightyear.
I come in peace.

276
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,095
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

277
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,142
Wh-why, thank you!

278
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,937
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

279
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,766
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

280
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,942
Voice box:
Buzz lightyear to the rescue!

281
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,987
Toys: Ohl

282
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,654
hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

283
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,948
- Only it's...
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

284
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,778
Hamm: Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

285
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,411
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

286
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,745
So, uh, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

287
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,286
Well, no. Actually, I-I'm stationed up
in the gamma quadrant of sector four.

288
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,047
As a member of the elite
universe protection unit

289
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,544
of the space ranger corps,

290
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,343
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion

291
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,514
from the evil emperor zurg,
sworn enemy of the galactic alliance.

292
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,218
Oh, really? I'm from playskool.

293
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,598
And I'm from mattel.
Well, I'm not really from mattel.

294
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,765
I'm actually from a smaller company that
was purchased in a leveraged buyout.

295
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,350
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

296
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,151
Well, sure. Look at him.

297
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,984
He's got more gadgets on him
than a Swiss army knife.

298
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,820
Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful.

299
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,472
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

300
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,988
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

301
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,033
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

302
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,834
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

303
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,164
All right, that's enough!

304
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,589
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

305
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,042
- Toy?
- T-o-y. Toy!

306
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:20,130
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "space ranger."

307
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,676
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

308
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,260
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?

309
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,392
Uh, Mr. lightyear,
uh, now, I'm curious.

310
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,099
What does a space ranger
actually do?

311
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,230
He's not a space ranger!

312
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,940
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!

313
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,444
Excuse me.

314
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:44,036
- Toys: Ooh!
- Oh, impressive wingspan! Very good!

315
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:48,867
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

316
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,377
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

317
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,753
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

318
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,878
- You can't.
- Can.

319
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,675
Can't. Can't. Can't!

320
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,178
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

321
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:05,432
- Okay, then, Mr. light beer, prove it.
- All right, then, I will.

322
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,430
Stand back, everyone!

323
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,899
To infinity and beyond!

324
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,929
- Can!
- Rex: Whoa!

325
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,220
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

326
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,933
I found my movin' buddy.

327
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,436
Thank you. Th-thank you all.
Thank you.

328
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:58,398
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

329
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,610
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

330
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,618
- Golly Bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

331
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,765
You know, in a couple of days,

332
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,121
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.

333
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,914
Woody: They'll see.

334
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,335
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

335
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,584
J I was on top of the world
livin' high

336
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,373
j it was right in my pocket

337
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,550
Andy: Whoa!

338
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,752
J I was livin' the life

339
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,219
j things were just the way
they should be

340
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,807
j when from out of the sky
like a bomb

341
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,142
j comes some little punk
in a rocket

342
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,811
j now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me

343
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,861
buzz lightyear to the rescue!

344
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,283
J strange

345
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,785
j things are happening to me

346
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,242

j strange things

349
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,803
j ain't no doubt about it

350
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,933
J I had friends
I had lots of friends

351
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,516
j now all my friends are gone

352
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,777
j and I'm doin' the best I can

353
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,695
j to carry on

354
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,191
- j I had power
- Chorus: J power

355
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,656
- j' I was respected
- &' respected

356
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,738
j but not any more

357
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,540
j and I've lost the love of the one

358
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,415

359
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,840
j let me tell you 'bout it

360
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,718
j things are happenin' to me

361
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,882
j strange

362
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,967
j things

363
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,100
j strange

364
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,898
j things are happenin' to me

365
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,397
j ain't no doubt about it

366
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,741

367
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,243
j things

368
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,577
j strange

369
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,707
j things j

370
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,374
finally!

371
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,460
Hey, who's got my hat?

372
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,339
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

373
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,546
Ah-ha! Ah-ha, ha, ha!
Gimme that!

374
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,306
Say there, lizard and stretchy dog,
let me show you something.

375
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,306
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

376
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,264
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

377
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,438
Together: Wow!

378
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,437
With permanent ink too!

379
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,190
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

380
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,949
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

381
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,361
Uh... let what? I don't, uh...
What do you mean? Who?

382
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,538
I know Andy's
excited about buzz.

383
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,992
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

384
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,955
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right, that's it!

385
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,966
Hmm. Unidirectional bonding strip.

386
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,633
Mr. lightyear wants more tape.

387
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,804
Hmm?

388
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,307
Listen, light snack,
you stay away from Andy.

389
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:19,140
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

390
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,725
What are you talking about?

391
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,353
Where's that bonding strip?

392
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,980
And another thing,

393
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,194
stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!

394
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,679
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with star command?

395
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:36,696
Oh-ho, okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

396
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,620
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

397
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,721
The air isn't... toxic.

398
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,801
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

399
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,220
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

400
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:06,350
You actually think
you're the buzz lightyear?

401
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,486
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

402
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,319
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real buzz lightyear!

403
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,700
You're mocking me, aren't you?

404
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,532
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

405
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,991
Where?

406
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,755
Boy: Yes!

407
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,629
Whoal - uh-oh.

408
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,755
It's sid!

409
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,552
Sid: Don't move!

410
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,304
I thought he was at summer camp.

411
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,508
They must've kicked him out
early this year.

412
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,846
Rex: Oh, no, not sid!

413
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,393
Sid: Incoming!

414
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,691
- Who is it this time?
- L... I can't... I can't tell.

415
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,897
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.

416
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,857
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.

417
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,072
Woody: Oh, no,
it's a combat Carl.

418
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,156
What's going on?

419
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,910
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.

420
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,491
I'd better take a look anyway.

421
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,085
Buzz: Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

422
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,417
That's why, sid.

423
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,882
Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.

424
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,009
No, no, that's scud, you idiot.

425
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,507
That is sid.

426
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,553
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

427
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,844
He tortures toys, just for fun!

428
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,517
Well, then we've got
to do something.

429
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,506
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

430
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,772
- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
- Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

431
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,157
Melt him with your scary laser.

432
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,236
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

433
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,076
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

434
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,957
Look out!

435
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,749
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

436
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,877
- Whoo!
- I could've stopped him.

437
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,134
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

438
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,765
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

439
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,265
The sooner we move, the better.

440
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,312
Yeah!

441
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,354
Andy: To infinity and beyond!

442
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,698
All this packing
makes me hungry.

443
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,698
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, pizza planet?

444
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,701
Pizza planet? Oh, cool!

445
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,495
Mom: Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

446
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,874
- Andy: Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

447
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,922
- Just one?
- One toy?

448
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,338
Hmm.

449
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,089
Will Andy pick me?

450
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,973
"Don't count on it"?

451
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,903
Mmm!

452
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,743
Buzz! Oh, buzz! Buzz lightyear.

453
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,191
Buzz lightyear,
thank goodness. We've got trouble!

454
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,922
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

455
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,751
A helpless toy, it's...
It's trapped, buzz!

456
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,258
Then we've no time to lose.

457
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,222
I don't see anything!

458
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,554
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

459
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,814
What kind of toy...

460
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,445
Oh! Whoa, whoa! Oh!

461
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,583
Together: Buzz!

462
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,161
Buzz!

463
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,087
Slinky: I don't see him
in the driveway.

464
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,793
- I think he bounced into sid's yard!
- Oh! Buzz!

465
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:06,098
Hey, everyone, r.C.'S frying to
say something. What is it, boy?

466
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,928
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?

467
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,437
- I mean humpty-dumpty was pushed...
- No!

468
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,722
By Woody!

469
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,606
All: What? Wait a minute.

470
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:20,028
You don't think I meant to knock buzz
out the window, do you? Potato head?

471
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,777
That's Mr. potato head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

472
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,280
Now, it was an accident, guys.

473
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,237
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

474
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,748
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

475
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,330
Well, ye... n...
I don't like confrontations!

476
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,084
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

477
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,794
You don't deserve to... hey!

478
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,173
You couldn't handle buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

479
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:47,347
Didn't wanna face the fact that buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

480
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,765
So you got rid of him.

481
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,517
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

482
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,561
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

483
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,765
I don't think we should
give him the chance.

484
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,857
Sergeant: There he is, men.
Frag him!

485
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,464
Let's string him up
by his pull string!

486
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,900
Hamm: I got dibs on his hat!
Bo: Would you boys stop it!

487
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,025
Tackle him!

488
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,732
No, no, no! Wait!
I can explain everything!

489
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,694
Andy: Okay, mom, be right down.
I've gotta get buzz.

490
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,904
Sergeant: Retreat!

491
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,786
Mom, do you know where buzz is?

492
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,328
- Mom: No, I haven't seen him.
- Psstl

493
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,418
- mom: Andy, I'm heading out the door!
- But, mom, I can't find him!

494
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,970
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

495
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,013
Oh, okay.

496
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,519
I couldn't find my buzz.
I know I left him right there.

497
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,559
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

498
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,285
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

499
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,462
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

500
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,836
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

501
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,878
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

502
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,884
Oh, where could he be?

503
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,778
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

504
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,730
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

505
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,861
Yuk, yuk, yuk! Funny, mom.

506
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,370
Aw, great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

507
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,996
Buzz!

508
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,331
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

509
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,713
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

510
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,299
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room

511
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:54,600
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

512
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,268
Huh? Right? Buddy?

513
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,939
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

514
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,893
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

515
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,984
- Oh. Well, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet, are we?

516
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,031
No.

517
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,698
Okay, come on!

518
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,957
Woody: You want a piece of me?

519
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,710
Owww!

520
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,043
Voice box: Buzz, buzz,
buzz lightyear to the rescue.

521
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,377
- Aah-ouch!
- Mom: Next stop.

522
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,962
Pizza planet! Yeah!

523
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,974
Andy!

524
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,644
Wh... doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?

525
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,322
I'm lost!

526
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,698
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

527
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,332
Buzz lightyear mission log.

528
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,745
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

529
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,080
You!

530
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,314
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!

531
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,731
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

532
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,318
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

533
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,683
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

534
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,870
My... my fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

535
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,033
Oh, yeah?

536
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,203
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship

537
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,359
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

538
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,873
Don't talk to me
about importance!

539
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,960
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

540
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,545
What? What are
you talkin' about?

541
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,302
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, emperor zurg

542
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,008
has been secretly building
a weapon

543
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,394
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

544
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:07,725
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

545
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,018
And you, my friend,
are responsible

546
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,438
for delaying my rendezvous
with star command!

547
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,071
You... are... a... toy!

548
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,369
You aren't the real
buzz lightyear! You're a...

549
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:24,249
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

550
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,913
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.

551
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,122
Farewell.

552
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,254
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

553
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,587
"Rendezvous with star command."

554
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,339
Driver: Hey, gas dude!
Attendant: You talkin' to me?

555
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,925
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- Pizza planet? Andy!

556
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,934
Do you know
where cutting boulevard is?

557
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,387
Oh, no!

558
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,352
I can't show my face
in that room without buzz.

559
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,355
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away!

560
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,817
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I...

561
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:59,072
I found a spaceship!

562
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,829
It's a spaceship, buzz!

563
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,917
Come on, man, hurry up! Um, like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

564
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,630
- Attendant: Cutting boulevard, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

565
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,633
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin

566
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,090
- once it jettisons its food supply?
- Uh-huh.

567
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,598
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

568
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:25,227
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait, buzz! Buzz!

569
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,349
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

570
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,648
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

571
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,980
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, bu...

572
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,316
Buzz! Buzz!

573
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,968
Driver: That's two lefts
and a right, huh?

574
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,904
- Thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah. And remember, kid...

575
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,361
Buzz!

576
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,675
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

577
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,347
Man on pa: Next shuttle lift-off
is scheduled for

578
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,738
t-minus 30 minutes and counting.

579
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,372
Robot: You are clear to enter.

580
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,208
Welcome fo pizza planet.

581
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,041
Woman on pa:
The white zone is for immediate pizza...

582
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,551
Sheriff!

583
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,799
There you are.

584
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,133
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

585
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,435
Great idea, Woody.

586
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,638
I like your thinkin...

587
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,650
Robot: You are clear to enter.
Welcome to pizza planet.

588
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,398
Buzz: Now!

589
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,234
Quickly, sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

590
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,032
Woman on pa: Jones, party
of five, your shuttle is now boarding...

591
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,069
Boy: Hey, mom,
can we have some tokens?

592
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,745
Ow! Watch where you're going!

593
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,288
Sorry.

594
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:19,504
Man on pa:
Hine, eight, seven, six,

595
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,677
five, four, three,

596
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,755
fwo, one.

597
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,346
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

598
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,945
Mom, can I play black hole?
Please, please, please?

599
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,938
- Andy!
- Now, we need to find a ship

600
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,446
- that's headed for sector 12.
- Wait a minute. No, buzz! This way.

601
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,950
- There's a special ship. I just saw it.
- You mean it has hyperdrive?

602
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,618
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

603
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,577
And astro... turf!

604
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,166
- Where is it? I-I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.

605
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,667
Spaceship!

606
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,756
All right, buzz, get ready.
And...

607
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,658
- And the universe explodes!
- Okay, buzz, when I say go,

608
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,389
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!

609
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,164
- No!
- Andy: Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

610
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,678
can I have some alien slime?

611
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,439
This cannot be happening to me.

612
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,076
- A stranger.
- From the outside.

613
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:32,532
- Aliens together: Ooh!
- Greetings. I am buzz lightyear.

614
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,833
I come in peace.

615
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,668
Man on pa: Before your
space journey, re-energize yourself

616
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:44,335
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

617
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,303
Buzz: This is an
intergalactic emergency.

618
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,839
I need to commandeer
your vessel to sector 12.

619
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,346
Who's in charge here?

620
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,228
Aliens: The claw!

621
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,523
The claw is our master.

622
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,854
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.

623
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,362
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

624
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,365
Take that!

625
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,193
Oh, no! Sid!

626
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,869
Get down!

627
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,540
What's gotten into you? I was...

628
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,826
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...

629
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,336
Shh! The claw, it moves.

630
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,169
I have been chosen!

631
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,881
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

632
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,262
Gotchal

633
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,055
a buzz lightyear? No way!

634
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,030
Sid: Yes!

635
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,949
Buzz! No!

636
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,582
Hey!

637
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,205
He has been chosen!

638
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,965
- He must go.
- Hey!

639
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,613
- What are you doing?
- Do not fight the claw.

640
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,753
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

641
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,096
All right! Double prizes!

642
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,355
Let's go home and... play.

643
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,780
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

644
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,992
- You're almost home.
- Nirvana is coming.

645
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,623
- The mystic portal awaits.
- Will you be quiet?

646
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,204
You guys don't get it, do you?

647
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,541
Once we go into sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

648
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,126
Whoa, scud! Hey, boy!

649
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,257
Sit! Good boy.

650
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,140
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze! I

651
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,803
ready, set, now!

652
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,681
Hannah! Hey, Hannah!

653
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,899
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

654
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,353
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

655
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,650
I don't know!

656
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,075
- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
- What? Hey!

657
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,948
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

658
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,496
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.

659
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,165
- Hannah: No!
- No, not sid's room. Not there.

660
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,163
Hey, give her back!

661
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,085
Sid! Sid!

662
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,295
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.

663
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,335
Prepare the or, stat!

664
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,672
Patient is... prepped.

665
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:41,261
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.

666
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,144
Now for the tricky part. Pliers!

667
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,026
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

668
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:52,606
Doctor, you've done it!

669
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,278
Hannah!

670
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,491
Janie's all better now.

671
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,077
Hannah: Mom! Mom!
Sid: She's lying!

672
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,784
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

673
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,967
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

674
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,272
Locked.

675
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,566
There's gotta be another way
outta here.

676
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:43,031
Uh, buzz? W-was that you?

677
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,092
Hey, hi there, little fella.

678
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,551
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

679
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:30,378
B-b-b-b-bu... buzz!

680
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,800
They're cannibals.

681
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,145
Mayday, mayday.

682
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,477
Come in, star command.
Send reinforcements.

683
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,900
Star command, do you copy?

684
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,778
I've set my laser from stun to kill.

685
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:59,987
Aw, great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

686
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,534
Rex: Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

687
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,332
Buzz, is that you?

688
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,459
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

689
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,621
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

690
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,666
Look, they're home.

691
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,423
Mom, have you seen Woody?

692
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,430
- Where was the last place you left him?
- Right here in the Van.

693
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,183
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

694
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,769
He's not here, mom.
Woody's gone.

695
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,225
Woody's gone?

696
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,231
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

697
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,438
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

698
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:42,742
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

699
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,038
Oh, slink, I hope he's okay.

700
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:55,129
Sid: Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

701
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,092
I can see your will is strong.

702
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,843
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

703
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:19,229
Where are your rebel friends now?

704
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,884
Sid's mom:
Sid, your pop tarts are ready!

705
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,489
All right!

706
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,834
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, sheriff.

707
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,586
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

708
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,630
I sure hope this isn't permanent.

709
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,964
Still no word from star command.
We're not that far from the space port.

710
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,515
The door. It's open! We're freel

711
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,788
Woody, we don't know what's out there!

712
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,098
I'll tell you wha...

713
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,598
They're gonna eat us, buzz!
Do something quick!

714
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,063
Shield your eyes.

715
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,287
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...

716
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,988
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

717
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,786
- Get away! Hoo-cha!
- Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?

718
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,664
- Stop that.
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!

719
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:15,494
- Woody, stop it!
- Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!

720
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,412
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

721
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,796
There's no place like home.

722
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,551
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.

723
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,443
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Shh!

724
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,836
Voice box: Yee-haw!
Giddyap, pardner!

a-movin'!

726
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,303
Split up!

00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,589
J out among the stars I sail

00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,358
Mom: What, dear? What was that?

770
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,069
Never mind!

771
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,284
Oof! Oof!

772
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,212
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

773
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:31,749
Buzz's voice box: There's a secret
mission in uncharted space. Let's go.

774
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:35,211
Hannah: Really?
That is so interesting.

775
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,806
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. nesbitt?

776
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,053
Buzz!

777
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,560
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

778
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:47,190
- Oh, no!
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. nesbitt.

779
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,395
It goes quite well with your head.

780
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,128
Hannah!

781
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:52,739
Oh, Hannah!

782
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,649
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

783
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,529
I'll be right back.

784
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:04,328
What is it, mom?
Mom, where are you?

785
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,909
Buzz. Hey. Buzz, are you okay?

786
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:10,204
Gone! It's all gone.

787
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,124
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. Whoo-whoo. See ya.

788
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,254
What happened to you?

789
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:17,007
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

790
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:21,090
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down darjeeling with

791
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,306
Marie antoinette
and her little sister.

792
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,522
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

793
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,349
Let's get you outta here, buzz.

794
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,436
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

795
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:38,404
- I am Mrs. nesbitt! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Snap out of it, buzz!

796
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,572
I-I-i-I'm sorry. I...
You're right.

797
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,492
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

798
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,622
I can get through this.

799
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,453
- Oh, I'm a sham!
- Shh!

800
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:52,834
- Look at me.
- Quiet, buzz.

801
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:55,792
I can't even fly out of a window.

802
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,128
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

803
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:02,056
The apron is a bit much.
"Out the window"!

804
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,427
Buzz, you're a genius!

805
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,809
Come on, come on. This way.

806
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,104
Years of academy, training, wasted!

807
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,523
Ha, ha. B-3.

808
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,726
- Miss! G-6.
- Oh!

809
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,028
- You sunk it. Are you peeking?
- Heh, heh!

810
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,403
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

811
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,905
- Give me the nose. Come on.
- How about three out of five?

812
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,322
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

813
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,038
- Son of a building block. It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

814
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,541
- Ha, ha! Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

815
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,666
- Woody?
- You're kidding!

816
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,840
- Woody?
- Ha! We're gonna get outta here, buzz.

817
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,344
Buzz?

818
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,049
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

819
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,260
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

820
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,016
- I knew you'd come back, Woody.
- What are you doin' over there?

821
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,564
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

822
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,607
Herel catch this!

823
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,695
Bo: Hal

824
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,236
- whoa! I've got it, Woody.
- He got it, Woody.

825
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:01,191
Good goin', slink. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.

826
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,805
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?

827
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,194
- Hey!
- Potato head.

828
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,238
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?

829
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,324
Have you forgotten
what he did to buzz?

830
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,937
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

831
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:15,375
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, potato head.

832
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,832
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

833
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:21,218
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

834
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:25,048
Tell the nice toys that you're...
That you're not dead.

835
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,968
Just a sec!

836
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:32,180
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

837
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,732
That's very funny, buzz.

838
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,895
- This is serious!
- Rex: Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

839
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,029
Potato head: He's lying.
Buzz ain't there.

840
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,824
Oh! Hi, buzz!

841
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,948
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

842
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,748
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

843
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,699
Hey, look! It's buzz!

844
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:57,668
Hey, buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

845
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,089
Give me five, man!

846
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,382
Something's screwy here.

847
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,294
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, buzz?

848
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,254
You bet. Give me a hug.

849
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,806
Ho-ho! Boy, I love you too.

850
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,554
See? It is buzz.

851
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,766
- Now give back the lights, potato head.
- Wait just a minute.

852
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,056
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothing!

853
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,606
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!

854
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,071
- It's not what you think. I swear!
- Save it for the jury.

855
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,736
I hope sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

856
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,700
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

857
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,749
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

858
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,159
Come on. Let's get outta here.

859
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,870
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

860
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,547
Woody: Come back! Slink!

861
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:44,593
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!

862
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,926
No! No! Come back!

863
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,466
Slinky!

864
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,685
Buzz! Go away!

865
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,692
You disgusting freaks! Aaah!

866
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,776
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals! Aah! Oof!

867
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,703
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

868
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,580
What are you doin'?

869
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,589
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

870
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,670
But-but they're cannibals.

871
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,347
We saw them eat
those other toys.

872
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,233
Uh, sorry. I-i-1 thought
that you were gonna...

873
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,902
You know,
you know, eat my friend.

874
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,063
Woody: Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

875
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,568
- What's wrong?
- Sid's mom: Sid?

876
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,365
Sid: Not now, mom! I'm busy!

877
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,868
- Sid! Buzz, come on!
- Mom: You left that door open.

878
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:56,328
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let sid trash you! But don't blame me!

879
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,871
It came! It finally came!

880
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,713
Ha, hal

881
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,713
"the big one."

882
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,138
"Extremely dangerous.

883
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,933
"Keep out of reach of children."

884
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,472
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

885
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,433
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

886
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:41,752
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

887
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,469
Sid: Heh, heh.

888
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,673
Now. Yes.

889
00:55:56,603 --> 00:56:00,061
Oh, no!

890
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,270
Oh, man!

891
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,691
Sid Phillips reporting.

892
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,276
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed

893
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,113
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

894
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,032
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.

895
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,247
Sweet dreams.

896
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:32,132
Mom: I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

897
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,341
But what if we
leave them behind?

898
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,219
Oh, don't worry, honey.

899
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,723
I'm sure we'll find Woody and buzz
before we leave tomorrow.

900
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,277
Rex: I need air!

901
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,480
Will you quit movin' around?

902
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:55,159
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.

903
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,702
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

904
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,950
Everyone else was picked.

905
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,042
Bo: Oh, Woody.

906
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,960
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

907
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,601
Psst. Psst! Hey, buzz!

908
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,028
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

909
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,575
Oh, come on, buzz, I...

910
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:48,788
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

911
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,709
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

912
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:56,629
Why, sure you can, buzz.
You can get me outta here.

913
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,056
Then I'll get that rocket off you, and
we'll make a break for Andy's house.

914
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,681
Andy's house, sid's house.
What's the difference?

915
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,814
Oh, buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

916
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,359
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

917
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,112
You were right all along.
I'm not a space ranger.

918
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:18,408
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

919
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,738
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

920
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,243
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a space ranger.

921
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,619
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

922
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:28,794
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

923
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,587
And it's not because
you're a space ranger, pal.

924
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:35,501
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

925
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,176
But why would Andy want me?

926
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:42,554
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you! You're a buzz lightyear.

927
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,389
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

928
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,977
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

929
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,434
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

930
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,612
You are a cool toy.

931
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,944
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

932
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,781
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have

933
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:09,167
against a buzz lightyear
action figure?

934
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,836
Alll can do is...

935
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:16,337
Voice box:
There's a snake in my boots.

936
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,760
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me

937
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,512
when he's got you?

938
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:25,972
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

939
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,827
Listen, buzz, forget about me.

940
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,834
You should get outta here
while you can.

941
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,134
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...

942
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,271
Come on, sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

943
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,314
Now let's get you out of this thing.

944
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,770
Yes, sir!

945
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:19,480
Come on, buzz. We can do it.

946
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,328
Woody, it's the moving Van.

947
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,535
We gotta get outta here now.

948
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,000
Come on, buzz.

949
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,758
All right.

950
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:43,049
Hey, I'm out! Almost there.

951
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,393
I want to ride the pony.

952
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,683
Phew.

953
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:58,106
Woody? Woody? Are you all right?

954
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,355
I'm fine. I'm okay.

955
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,670
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off! Whoo!

956
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,375
To infinity and beyond!

957
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,589
\whoo-hoo!

958
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,640
Aah! Back, back.

959
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,437
Down, down!

960
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,224
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

961
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:41,614
Guys!

962
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,899
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

963
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:50,491
There's a good toy down there, and he's
gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes.

964
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:54,120
All because of me.
We gotta save him.

965
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,918
And, uh... but I need your help.

966
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:07,012
Please. He's my friend.

967
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,390
And he's the only one I've got.

968
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:27,320
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

969
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,492
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

970
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,696
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

971
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,380
Sid: Houston to mission control.
Come in, control.

972
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,797
Launch pad is being constructed.

973
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,716
Woody: All right, listen up.

974
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:55,678
I need pump boy here,
ducky here.

975
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,437
Legs, you're with ducky.

976
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,854
Rollerbob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

977
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:05,395
Okay. Let's move!

978
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:27,421
Wind the frog.

979
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,733
Walit for the signal.

980
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,625
Gol

981
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:14,089
all right, let's go!

982
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,140
Hannah: I'll get it!

983
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,433
Now!

984
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,944
I'm coming. I'm coming.

985
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:30,985
Scud!

986
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,119
Stupid dog.

987
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,417
Lean back!

988
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:54,300
Sid: Uh, mission control, is
the launch pad construction complete?

989
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,383
Uh, Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

990
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:01,095
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

991
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,853
Countdown will commence
momentarily.

992
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,227
- Stand by.
- Let's go.

993
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:09,527
Hey, ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.

994
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,570
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.

995
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,398
Shh! What?

996
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:16,075
It's okay. Everything's under control.

997
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:18,849
Woody, what are you doing?

998
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:23,162
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...

999
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,544
Hey? How'd you get out here?

1000
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:31,208
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

1001
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,013
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

1002
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,842
Uh, Roger. Permission granted.

1003
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:44,054
You are confirmed
at "t" minus ten seconds.

1004
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:47,892
And counting. Ten, nine,

1005
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,773
eight, seven, six,

1006
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,981
five, four, three, two,

1007
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,113
one!

1008
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,988
Woody's voice box:
Reach for the sky!

1009
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,538
Huh?

1010
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:03,080
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

1011
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,160
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

1012
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:11,206
- It's busted.
- Who are you callin' busted, buster?

1013
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,299
That's right.

1014
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:17,049
I'm talking to you, sid Phillips.

1015
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,973
We don't like bein' blown up, sid,

1016
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,050
or smashed or ripped apart.

1017
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:25,561
"We"? - That's right! Your toys!

1018
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,889
Mama!

1019
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,686
Mama!

1020
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,395
Mama! Mama!

1021
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,667
Aaah!

1022
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:53,624
Aaah!

1023
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,505
Mamal

1024
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:01,594
from now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

1025
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:05,802
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, sid.

1026
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:12,230
We toys can see everything.

1027
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,775
So play nice.

1028
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,984
Aaah!

1029
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:25,614
Ha-ha! We did it!
We did it! Ha-ha! Yes!

1030
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,283
The toys! The toys are alive!

1031
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,870
N-nice toy. Aaah!

1032
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,214
What's wrong, sid?

1033
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,008
Don't you want to play with Sally?

1034
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,387
Nice work, fellows. Good job.

1035
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,119
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

1036
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,849
Woody.

1037
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,895
Thanks.

1038
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,181
Mother:
Everybody say, "bye, house!"

1039
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,609
- Woody! The Van!
- Andy: Bye, house.

1040
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,863
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

1041
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:06,071
Quick!

1042
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,076
Just go. I'll catch up.

1043
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,676
Both: Aaah!

1044
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,682
Come on!

1045
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,036
You can do it, Woody!

1046
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,212
I got it! Woo-hoo-hoo!

1047
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:56,400
I made it.

1048
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:04,588
Aaah! Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

1049
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,264
- Down! Aah! Aah!
- Hold on, Woody!

1050
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,973
I can't do it.

1051
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,389
Take care of Andy for me!

1052
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:17,275
No!

1053
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:19,774
Buzz!

1054
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,213
- Ow!
- Are we there already?

1055
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,802
- Woody?
- How did you...?

1056
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,287
- How'd he get here?
- Where have you...?

1057
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,551
What happened? Ow!

1058
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,765
What's goin' on?
What's he takin'?

1059
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,934
Aha! There you are!

1060
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:59,271
Hey. What's he doing?

1061
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,688
- Aah!
- He's at it again!

1062
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,704
Ha, ha, ha!

1063
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,288
- Get him!
- Come on!

1064
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,427
Ah, ah, no, no!

1065
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,470
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1066
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1067
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:38,147
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1068
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,860
Pig pile!

1069
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,323
Aaah!

1070
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,717
Woman: Get outta that car!
Man: Move it!

1071
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:08,889
Whew.

1072
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,884
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1073
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,057
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1074
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,510
- Nol!
- Toss him overboard!

1075
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,724
No, no, no! Wait! Aah!

1076
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:22,225
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1077
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,112
Aah!

1078
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,486
Oh! Woody!

1079
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:32,827
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
- Look out!

1080
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,033
Aaah!

1081
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,996
Now let's catch up to that truck.

1082
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,001
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding r.C.

1083
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,216
What? And buzz is with him!

1084
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,634
It is buzz!

1085
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,720
Woody was telling the truth.

1086
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:02,231
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt.

1087
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,392
We're almost there!

1088
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,812
Rocky, the ramp!

1089
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,946
Look out!

1090
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,116
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1091
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:30,256
- Attaboy, slink!
- Oh! Woody!

1092
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,680
Woody! Speed up!

1093
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,720
- Speed up!
- The batteries!

1094
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,427
They're runnin' out!

1095
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,512
Slinky: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1096
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:42,104
Whoa! Aah!

1097
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,022
Timon and pumbaa:
J hakuna matata

1098
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:46,734
j what a wonderful phrase &

1099
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,861
aaah!

1100
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:55,739
- I can't hold on much longer.
- Slink! Hang on!

1101
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,946
- Aaah!
- Ouch!

1102
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,755
Great!

1103
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,465
Woody! The rocket!

1104
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,009
The match! Yes!

1105
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,015
Thank you, sid!

1106
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,271
No! No, no! No!

1107
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:34,816
No! Oh, no!

1108
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:38,703
No, no, no, no, no,

1109
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,575
no!

1110
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,372
No!

1111
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:54,510
- Woody! What are you doing?
- Hold still, buzz!

1112
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,259
Ha-ha! Ha-hal you did it!

1113
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,179
Next stop, Andy!

1114
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:04,387
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1115
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,450
I should have held on longer.

1116
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:20,653
Look! Look! It's Woody
and buzz comin' up fast!

1117
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,197
Woody!

1118
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,586
Rex: Aah! Take cover!

1119
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:43,051
Aaah! This is the part
where we blow up!

1120
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:44,560
Not today!

1121
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,476
Aaah!

1122
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:58,324
Hey, buzz! You're flyin'l

1123
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,699
this isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1124
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,450
Woody: Ha-ha-hal

1125
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:08,660
to infinity and beyond!

1126
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:16,926
Uh, buzz, we missed the truck.

1127
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,087
We're not aiming for the truck.

1128
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:26,848
Hey, wow!

1129
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:29,100
- Mother: What? What is it?
- Woody! Buzz!

1130
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,273
Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?

1131
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,400
- Here in the car!
- See?

1132
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,779
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1133
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:49,034
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1134
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,278
Sergeant:
Frankincense, this is myrrh.

1135
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,634
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.

1136
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,590
Whoa! It's time!

1137
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,056
Ohh! Oh, Bo.

1138
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:06,517
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1139
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,686
Merry Christmas, sheriff.

1140
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,227
- Say, isn't that mistletoe?
- Mm-hmm.

1141
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,650
Ooh!

1142
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:18,321
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.

1143
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,698
That way I could play the,
uh, dominant predator.

1144
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:22,821
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

1145
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:26,655
Sergeant: Molly's first
present is Mrs. potato head.

1146
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,743
Repeat, a Mrs. potato head.

1147
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,870
Way to go, Idaho!

1148
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,043
Gee, I'd better shave.

1149
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:39,133
Sergeant: Come in, frankincense.

1150
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,214
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1151
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,092
- It's...
- Buzz. Buzz lightyear,

1152
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,203
- you are not worried, are you?
- Sergeant: I can't quite...

1153
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,662
- Me? No, no. Pfft.
Sergeant: Make out...

1154
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,393
No. No, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

1155
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,813
Sergeant: A large box... it's-it's-it's...

1156
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,520
- Are you?
- Now, buzz,

1157
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:59,812
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1158
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,878
Andy on monitor:
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1159
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,908
Andy: Wow! A puppy!

1160
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:19,874
